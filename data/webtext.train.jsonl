Similarly, all Jews who died in German captivity during World War II -- no matter what the cause of death -- are counted as \"victims of the Holocaust.\"\n\nThis view is very misleading, if not deceitful. In fact, many tens of thousands of camp inmates and Jews lost their lives as direct and indirect victims of Allied action, or of the horrors of the Second World War. For example, the many thousands of Jews who perished in the notorious Bergen-Belsen camp during and after the final months of the war in Europe, including Anne Frank, were primarily victims not of German policy, but rather of the turmoil and chaos of war.\n\nAmong the German concentration camp prisoners who perished at Allied hands were some 7,000 inmates who were killed during the war's final week as they were being evacuated in three large German ships that were attacked by British war planes. This little-known tragedy is one of history's greatest maritime disasters.\n\nThe Cap Arcona, launched in May 1927, was a handsome passenger ship of the \"Hamburg-South America\" line. At 27,000 gross registered tons, it was the fourth-largest ship in the German merchant marine. For twelve years -- until the outbreak of war in 1939 -- she had sailed regularly between Hamburg and Rio de Janeiro. In the war's final months she was pressed into service by the German navy to rescue refugees fleeing from areas in the east threatened by the Red Army. This was part of a vast rescue operation organized by the German navy under the supervision of Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz. All but unknown in the United States today, this great undertaking saved countless lives. The Thielbek, a much smaller ship of 2,800 gross registered tons, was also used to transport refugees as part of the rescue operation.\n\nIn April 1945, Karl Kaufmann, Gauleiter of Hamburg and Reich Commissioner for merchant shipping, transferred the Cap Arcona and the Thielbek from naval command, and ordered them to Neustadt Bay in the Baltic Sea near the north German city of L\u00fcbeck.\n\nSome 5,000 prisoners hastily evacuated from the Neuengamme concentration camp (a few miles southeast of Hamburg) were brought on board the Cap Arcona between April 18 and 26, along with some 400 SS guards, a naval gunnery detail of 500, and a crew of 76. Similarly the Thielbek took on some 2,800 Neuengamme prisoners. Under the terrible conditions that prevailed in what remained of unoccupied Germany during those final weeks, conditions for the prisoners on board the two vessels were dreadful. Many of the tightly packed inmates were ill, and both food and water were in very short supply.\n\nOn the afternoon of May 3, 1945, British \"Typhoon\" fighter-bombers, striking in several attack waves, bombarded and fired on the Cap Arcona and then the Thielbek. The two ships, which had no military function or mission, were flying many large white flags. \"The hoisting of white flags proved useless,\" notes the Encyclopedia of the Third Reich. The attacks were thus violations of international law, for which -- if Britain and not Germany had been the vanquished power -- British pilots and their commanders could have been punished and even executed as \"war criminals.\"\n\nThe Thielbek, struck by rockets, bombs and machine gun fire, sank in just 15-20 minutes. British planes then fired on terror-stricken survivors who were struggling in rescue boats or thrashing in the cold sea. Nearly everyone on board the Thielbek perished quickly, including nearly all the SS guards, ship's officers and crew members. Only about 50 of the prisoners survived.\n\nThe burning Cap Arcona took longer to go under. Many inmates burned to death. Most of those who were able to leap overboard drowned in the cold sea, and only some 350-500 could be rescued. During the next several days hundreds of corpses washed up on nearby shores, and were buried in mass graves. Having sunk in shallow water, the wreck of the capsized Cap Arcona remained partially above water as a grim reminder of the catastrophe.\n\nA German reference work, Verheimlichte Dokumente, sums up:\n\nA particularly barbaric Allied war crime was the bombing on May 3, 1945, by British Royal Air Force planes of the passenger ships Cap Arcona and Thielbek in the L\u00fcbeck bay, packed with concentration camp inmates. Among the many 'nameless' victims were many prominent political figures, a fact that is hushed up today because the fact that concentration camp inmates, many of them"}

The Palace of Westminster\u2026 February 6, 2013\n\nCommonly thought to be older than it actually is due to its Gothic stylings (although, to be fair, parts of it do date from medieval times), the Palace of Westminster \u2013 or, as it's more commonly known, the Houses of Parliament \u2013 didn't actually take on much of its current appearance until the latter half of the 19th century.\n\nThe need for a new building for parliament arose after 1834 when a fire, caused by the overheating of two underfloor stoves used to incinerate the Exchequer's obsolete tally sticks, tore through the former complex, leaving only some structures from the old palace intact. They included the 11th century Westminster Hall (the largest in Europe when it was built), 14th century Jewel Tower and a chapterhouse, crypt and cloisters, all of which was once attached to the now gone St Stephen's Chapel.\n\nWhile King William IV offered the use of Buckingham Palace for Parliament, the idea \u2013 along with a host of other options \u2013 was rejected as unsuitable. Instead, a competition was held for a new design and after almost 100 entries were considered, architect Charles Barry and his design for a new palace in the perpendicular Gothic style was chosen. Interestingly, while Barry was a classical architect, under the terms of the competition, designs were required to be in a Gothic style, thought to embody conservative values .\n\nIncorporating some of the remains of the old palace \u2013 including Westminster Hall but not the Jewel Tower which to this day stands alone \u2013 the design was based around a series of internal courtyards with the House of Commons and House of Lords located on either side of a central lobby (first known as Octagonal Hall). The design involved reclaiming some land from the Thames so the building's main river-facing facade could be completed.\n\nTowers stand at either end of the complex \u2013 the Victoria Tower over the Sovereign's Entrance at the southern end of the complex (for many years the tallest square stone tower in the world) and the narrower tower formerly known as the Clock Tower which houses the bell Big Ben, at the northern end \u2013 and there is a central Octagonal Tower which stands directly over the Central Lobby. The Clock Tower, incidentally, was renamed the Elizabeth Tower last year in honour of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee (for more on it and Big Ben, see our earlier entries here and here).\n\nOther towers include the Speaker's Tower (located at the northern end of the building on the waterfront, this contains a residence for the Speaker), the Chancellor's Tower (located at the southern end, it too contained a residence originally used by the Lord Chancellor) and St Stephen's Tower \u2013 located in the middle of the building's west front, it contains the public entrance to the building. Significant other rooms in the palace complex include the Robing Room \u2013 where the Queen puts on her ceremonial robes and crown before the State Opening of Parliament \u2013 and the Royal Gallery, used for state occasions.\n\nThe foundation stone (the building was constructed out of sand-coloured limestone from Yorkshire) was laid in 1840 and construction of the monumental building \u2013 which features more than 1,100 rooms and two miles of passageways \u2013 wasn't completely finished until the 1870s although most of the work had been completed by 1860 (the year Barry died). The House of Lords first sat in their new chamber in 1847 and the House of Commons in 1852 (it was at this point that Barry was knighted for his work).\n\nThe cost, meanwhile, originally estimated at less than \u00a3750,000, ended up coming in at more than \u00a32 million.\n\nMuch of the interior decoration owes its appearance to the Gothic revivalist Augustus Pugin who designed everything from wallpapers, to floor tiles and furnishings. Pugin also helped Barry with the external appearance but like Barry died before the project was completely finished (in 1852).\n\nThe palace was bombed numerous times in World War II \u2013 in one raid, the Commons Chamber was destroyed as firefighters opted to save the much older Westminster Hall instead. It was later rebuilt under the direction of Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and completed by 1950. Other aspects of the building have also been restored.\n\nA Grade I-listed building classified as a World Heritage Site, Barry's Houses of Parliament remain one of London's most iconic structures. We'll be looking in more detail at some of the building's features in future posts.\n\nWHERE: Houses of Parliament (nearest Tube stations are Westminster, St James's Park and Embankment); WHEN: Tours (75 minutes) are run from 9.15am to 4.30pm on Saturdays (also six days a week during summer opening); COST: \u00a315 adults/\u00a310 concessions/\u00a36 children five to 15 years (children under five are free).

{"id": 7, "ended": true, "length": 725, "text": ": This week the Chilean government's promise to protect roughly 10 million acres of land became official, boosting the nation's parklands by 38.5 percent, according to a statement . Read our original story about the move below:\n\nLast week, the government of Chile signed an agreement taking possession of a 1-million-acres of private park land put together by a pair of American philanthropists. It also announced it would protect an additional 9 million acres of wildlands as national parks, reports Jonathan Franklin at The Guardian.\n\nKris McDivitt Tompkins, former CEO of the clothing company Patagonia and her husband, Doug Tompkins, co-founder of the North Face and Esprit clothing lines, began buying hundreds of thousands of acres in the wild Patagonia region of Chile in the early 1990s, The Guardian's John Vidal reported last year. Their goal, Vidal writes, was to \"buy and restore as much land as they could, improve and protect it, and then return it to people as public, national parks.\"\n\nAfter over two decades of work, they acquired 2.2 million acres of land, including the gifted land, Parque Pumal\u00edn and Patagonia, which together span roughly 1 million acres and represent the largest land donation from a private entity to a country.\n\nBut Chile was not always receptive to the couple. In the beginning of the project, they were accused of being CIA spies, of trying to hobble Chile's economic development and called a national security threat. At one point the government threatened to take their land.\n\n\"We were opposed for four years. We were 'the couple who cut Chile in half,'\" McDivitt Tompkins tells Vidal. \"They said we were setting up a nuclear-waste dump or a new Jewish state.\"\n\nBut in recent years, the Chilean government has warmed up to the conservation projects, and president Michelle Bachelet was on hand at the border of Pumalin Park to sign the documents authorizing the handover. As Elizabeth Royte at National Geographic reports, Chile hopes to include the new parks in a 1,500-mile tourism route they want to call the Ruta de los Parques, which would link together 17 national parks and offer everything from rainforest hikes and mountaineering to sea kayaking. By some estimates the new parks will bring $270 million into the area and employ 43,000 people.\n\nThe new parks make Chile one of Central and South America's most eco-conscious nations. \"That puts Chile right up there with Costa Rica in terms of the percentage of protected lands,\" Yvon Chouinard, founder of the Patagonia clothing company tells Franklin. \"No other human has ever created this many acres of protected wildlands\u2026These are tourist-ready parks with trails and cabins and infrastructure.\"\n\nHowever, Doug Tompkins, who died in 2015 in a kayaking accident, will never see the fruits of their labor. \"I wish my husband Doug, whose vision inspired today's historic pledge, were here on this memorable day. Our team and I feel his absence deeply,\" McDivitt Tompkins says in a press release. \"But I know that if Doug were here today, he would speak of national parks being one of the greatest expressions of democracy that a country can realize, preserving the masterpieces of a nation for all of its citizenry.\"\n\nThe handover of the Tompkins property will take place incrementally over the next two years."}

The plant-based food scene is changing rapidly, no longer are vegans thought to eat nothing but lettuce and lentils, the plant-based burger revolution has arrived. What's more, big investors are excited about it.\n\nRecently, Beyond Meat's burger, otherwise known as 'the burger that bleeds' accomplished something huge when they struck a deal with stores owned by Kroger, that means their burger will be stocked in 605 stores across the US. Beyond have seen investments from some big names including Bill Gates, General Mills and even meat producers Tyson Foods. Tyson's CEO said earlier this year that the future of protein may lie in the meatless market.\n\nA similar burger, made by Impossible Foods, who Bill Gates has also invested in, managed to accumulate $75 million worth of funding last month. Alongside Bill Gates, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and Asia's second richest man Li Ka-shing were amongst the contributors.\n\nImpossible are currently waiting on confirmation from the FDA about their ingredient 'heme', which they were granted a patent for this month. Heme is the key to their 'meat like' burgers and is derived from soy. As yet the FDA are undecided as to whether this product will be considered an allergen, which is currently stopping Impossible from distributing further. However, it seems that they will have a lot of support behind them when they do.\n\nTaking it one step further, from individual products to a whole chain of restaurants, By Chloe has taken the US by storm since its first store opened its doors in 2015. The fully plant-based chain which has been described as 'Shake Shack without the meat', is already venturing across the Atlantic to London, where it will open its first European store in Covent Garden later this year. Since opening, the chain has sold over 600,000 vegan burgers, which aren't the only item on their menu. These high figures may account for the whopping $13 million dollars invested in the chain recently to allow them to expand both in the US and overseas.\n\nStart-ups like these are seeing an increase in popularity, and it's not surprising. Plant-based foods are much more sustainable than their animal product alternative, something Impossible Foods boast about on their site. The increased number of options allow people who are still keen on the taste of meat, as well as those who want to celebrate vegetables, plenty of things to try without comprising their favourite foods.\n\nWith backing from big investors these companies could go from just starting out to fast food giants pretty quickly, and with everything they have to brag about it could mean a sharp decline in some of the world's biggest fast food outlets.\n\nUnless, of course, McDonalds want to jump on the plant-based bandwagon?\n\nImage credit: Impossible Foods | Beyond Meat | Grub Street | by Chloe"}
{"id": 9, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "by David E. Petzal - Thursday, June 29, 2017\n\nAccording to a poll by the Media Insight Project, only 6 percent of Americans have faith in the news media. Among readers of American Rifleman, that figure is likely even lower. We've learned that, in all probability, anything we read or hear about guns will be either biased or factually wrong, or both. How come?\n\nReason One:\n\nLack of accountability. When I broke into the magazine business in 1964, I had some basic rules drummed into my crew-cut head. If you edited a piece, you were responsible for everything in it: spelling, punctuation, facts, everything\u2014especially facts.\n\nIf you were wrong, God help you. The least you would get was a serious public tongue-lashing. As a result of this process I can tell you to this day that it's the Smithsonian Institution, not Institute, and that \"prairie\" is not spelled \"prarie.\" A cousin of mine, who worked at one of the big New York City daily newspapers, had exactly the same experience.\n\nThis seems to have gone by the wayside. A small example: On Jan. 5, in The New York Times, there was an article on \"ballistics vests.\" What's wrong with this? It's \"ballistic vests.\" \"Ballistics\" is the science of projectile behavior and is a noun, while \"ballistic\" means relating to ballistics, and is an adjective. No one at The Times appears to know the difference. If I had made that mistake, or my cousin had, we would have been screamed at for 10 minutes with no regard for our \"safe space.\"\n\nReason Two:\n\nPeople in the same profession tend to think alike. Among the news media, the collective wisdom regarding guns runs as follows:\n\n1. They believe guns are inherently evil.\n\n2. They think gun owners are, at the least, disturbed and, at the worst, dangerous.\n\n3. They believe the National Rifle Association has, since its founding in 1871, done nothing worthwhile, has never been right about anything and is nothing more than a shill for the firearm industry.\n\n4. They believe the Second Amendment has no relevance in today's United States, and if only we could institute reasonable gun controls there would be no more gun violence.\n\n5. It is their opinion that guns in the home lead only to tragedy, and self-protection is a myth.\n\nNow, let's assume that you're a student in journalism school, and the subject of guns comes up, and you venture the fact that you own guns, and use them, and that your family has always had guns in the home, and that there's never been an accident, and that you don't even know of any accidents. How do you think that statement would be received?\n\nMost likely, you would shortly receive a summons from the dean of students and probably the college psychiatrist to come in and chat, not that there's anything wrong, you understand, but \u2026 .\n\nOr let's say that you work in a newsroom and the subject of guns used in self-defense comes up and you point out that, every month, you can cite half a dozen or more cases in \"The Armed Citizen\" where someone who had a gun prevented a crime or saved themselves or someone else and, in many instances, did it without firing a shot. Imagine the look you're going to get from the news director. It will not be the kind of look that says your career will prosper here.\n\nReason Three:\n\nGood old-fashioned ignorance. I got my first exposure to this in the mid-1960s when the armed forces began issuing M16s. The 5.56 mm bullets, we were told by reporters, created terrible wounds because \"they tumbled through the air and hit people like little buzz saws.\"\n\n\"Golly gee,\" I said, (or words to that effect), \"that's just not possible. Anything that tumbles through the air isn't going to go where it's aimed. Just look at a football that doesn't spiral.\"\n\nBut there it was, and there was more to come.\n\nWhen the first Glocks were imported they were denounced as \"all plastic,\" and therefore undetectable at airports. The media, knowing nothing of how guns work, and not understanding such concepts as mass and resistance, printed the nonsense verbatim.\n\nWhen the great \"cop-killer-bullet\" brouhaha erupted, the media also neglected to check the facts. If they had, they would have learned that Teflon-coated ammunition was very expensive, made in limited amounts, sold to police agencies only and had never been used to kill a cop.\n\nJournalists are ignorant about guns because being knowledgeable about guns requires at least a smattering of"}

Vikings offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave wants quarterback Christian Ponder to slide head first after he suffered a concussion on a hit by Redskins linebacker London Fletcher after a feet first slide last season. Musgrave is fine with sliding feet first when there's no one around, but he thinks Ponder gets to the ground more quickly if he leads with his head in traffic.\n\n\"We don't want to expose ourselves by being a periscope up \u2014 exposing all our vital organs. We want to give them a very minimal surface,\" Musgrave said, via Dave Campbell of the Associated Press.\n\nGoing head first isn't going to eliminate the possibility of injuries. There's the chance of a shoulder or wrist injury as you go to the turf and rules governing when defensive players hit you aren't in place when the quarterback goes head first, to say nothing of the increased risk of injury. In 2010, Eli Manning lost a fumble against the Eagles that contributed to a Giants loss in a season that ended with the Giants one game out of a playoff spot.\n\nThere are risks either way, then, and the Vikings will be taking theirs head first this season."}

This heat affects its plate tectonics and, according to the scientists, the way it retains its water. Though the functions of that heat-to-plate-to-liquid interaction aren't fully understood -- it's \"one of the great mysteries in the geosciences,\" the study's advisor, Wendy Panero, put it -- scientists have speculated that the forces of heat convection in the mantle, the ones that move Earth's crust, have some kind of role in regulating the amount of water in the oceans. \"It seems that if a planet is to retain an ocean over geologic timescales, it needs some kind of crust 'recycling system,' and for us that's mantle convection,\" Unterborn said.\n\nWhich means, in turn, that plate tectonics could also be a key indicator of a planet's hospitality to life. Particularly for microbial life -- since microbial life on Earth, the study's authors point out, benefits from subsurface heat. (Take the single-celled microbe archaea, some of which live not off the energy of the sun, but rather off the heat rising from inside the Earth.) And that indicator, the team reasoned, can be approximated by analyzing a given exoplanet's sun: the more thorium in the star, say, the more likely a terrestrial planet formed around that star would be to support life. Since it would stand to reason that the planets that orbit around those suns contain more thorium, as well, that would suggest that the interiors of those exoplanets are warmer than ours -- and also that those planets are more geologically active than Earth. And that would mean that they are more likely than Earth to retain the liquid water that supports life.\n\nAnd: Of the eight solar twins the team studied, seven of them seemed to contain more thorium than our own star.\n\nOne star in the team's survey, for example, contained 2.5 times more thorium than our sun. And per the study's measurements, terrestrial planets that formed around that star likely generate 25 percent more internal heat than Earth does -- with all that that implies. So there could be at least one planet that is potentially more life-affirming than Earth. But there could also be, the study suggests, more where that came from: exoplanets that are more earthly than Earth -- planets nourished and made hospitable by the warmth of other suns.\n\nNow that the hunt for exoplanets has moved from science fiction to science, that finding -- preliminary and tentative as it is -- could have implications for humans' ability to find signs of life elsewhere in the universe. As study co-author Cayman Unterborn summed it up: \"If it turns out that these planets are warmer than we previously thought, then we can effectively increase the size of the habitable zone around these stars by pushing the habitable zone farther from the host star, and consider more of those planets hospitable to microbial life.\""}

It is now the premier Web site for human trafficking in the United States, according to the National Association of Attorneys General. And it's not a fly-by-night operation. Backpage is owned by Village Voice Media, which also owns the estimable Village Voice newspaper.\n\nPhoto\n\nAttorneys general from 48 states have written a joint letter to Village Voice Media, pleading with it to get out of the flesh trade. An online petition at Change.org has gathered 94,000 signatures asking Village Voice Media to stop taking prostitution advertising. Instead, the company has used The Village Voice to mock its critics. Alissa thought about using her real name for this article but decided not to for fear that Village Voice would retaliate.\n\nCourt records and public officials back Alissa's account, and there is plenty of evidence that under-age girls are marketed on Backpage. Arrests in such cases have been reported in at least 22 states.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJust this month, prosecutors in New York City filed charges in a case involving a gang that allegedly locked a 15-year-old Long Island girl in an empty house, drugged her, tied her up, raped her, and advertised her on Backpage. After a week of being sold for sex, prosecutors in Queens said, the girl escaped.\n\nLiz McDougall, general counsel of Village Voice Media, told me that it is \"shortsighted, ill-informed and counterproductive\" to focus on Backpage when many other Web sites are also involved, particularly because Backpage tries to screen out ads for minors and reports possible trafficking cases to the authorities. McDougall denied that Backpage dominates the field and said that the Long Island girl was marketed on 13 other Web sites as well. But if street pimps go to jail for profiteering on under-age girls, should their media partners like Village Voice Media really get a pass?\n\nParadoxically, Village Voice began as an alternative newspaper to speak truth to power. It publishes some superb journalism. So it's sad to see it accept business from pimps in the greediest and most depraved kind of exploitation.\n\nTrue, many prostitution ads on Backpage are placed by adult women acting on their own without coercion; they're not my concern. Other ads are placed by pimps: the Brooklyn district attorney's office says that the great majority of the sex trafficking cases it prosecutes involve girls marketed on Backpage.\n\nVideo\n\nAlissa, who grew up in a troubled household in Boston, has a story that is fairly typical. She says that one night when she was 16 \u2014 and this matches the account she gave federal prosecutors \u2014 a young man approached her and told her she was attractive. She thought that he was a rapper, and she was flattered. He told her that he wanted her to be his girlfriend, she recalls wistfully.\n\nWithin a few weeks, he was prostituting her \u2014 even as she continued to study as a high school sophomore. Alissa didn't run away partly because of a feeling that there was a romantic bond, partly because of Stockholm syndrome, and partly because of raw fear. She says violence was common if she tried connecting to the outside world or if she didn't meet her daily quota for cash.\n\n\"He would get aggressive and strangle me and physically assault me and threaten to sell me to someone that was more violent than him, which he eventually did,\" Alissa recalled. She said she was sold from one pimp to another several times, for roughly $10,000 each time.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That led her to cooperate with the police.\n\nThere are no simple solutions to end sex trafficking, but it would help to have public pressure on Village Voice Media to stop carrying prostitution advertising.

The charges carry a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. An agreed statement of facts tendered to the court details graphic communications which \"amount to child pornography\" that were exchanged between the men on Skype. The conversations include descriptions of what the pair would like to do to children, their preferences of children as young as three including ages and physical features, and discussion of where to access videos and photos of child pornography. On May 12, 2015, McCormack - who used the screen name \"oz4skinboi\" and claimed to be 28 - said he couldn't wait to look at \"B porn\". Hundreds of texts between McCormack and another man were detailed in court documents. Photo: AAP\n\nThe man responded: \"I have some vids ... wbu [what about you]?\" McCormack: \"Some\". Man: \"Cool cool, pics too?\" McCormack: \"None saved but links.\" In an early morning chat on January 4, 2017, McCormack wrote: \"I'm a total b loving pedo\".\n\nOver the next two and a half weeks, he sent messages including \"I wana get pedo with u\" and \"Proud ped, proud b lover\" The graphic messages were intercepted by the NSW Police Child Exploitation Internet Unit. Police also obtained a 30-second video of McCormack performing a sex act, which he sent to the other man. In the video, McCormack is heard to say he perves \"non stop\" when he's at the beach, a shopping centre or at the movies. As the chats went on, the man speaking with McCormack called him \"Ben\" and later mentioned McCormack's affiliation to A Current Affair, which gave police vital clues they needed to track him down.\n\nMcCormack was arrested at Moore Park on April 6, with search warrants carried out at his home and A Current Affair's offices in Willoughby. He declined a police interview. On Tuesday, a Channel Nine spokeswoman said McCormack had resigned, and that he no longer worked for the network. Following his brief appearance at Downing Centre Local Court, where he entered his guilty plea, McCormack grinned and appeared at ease, chatting to someone he recognised in the public gallery. Outside court, his lawyer Sam Macedone said McCormack never traded images of children. \"I just wanted to make it quite clear that there was never any images that were traded between Ben and anyone else of any child exploitation material,\" Mr Macedone said."}

I intended to see Rush's 2 Toronto concerts and a Blue Jays game.\n\nAt customs an agent Reid was intensely interested in my electronics, in particular she was obsessed with an old VHS VCR that was in a suitcase in my trunk along with a dozen or so VHS tapes. Every bit of media, Digital and analog was taken out of my vehicle and scrutinized. Even the \"timer\" VCR tapes with CSI Reruns and Oprah recorded on them. After logging in to my Twitter account, and finding a \"Tweet\" on my laptop to the username <Girls Name Redacted> Officer Reid accused me of lying to her about knowing \"<Girls Name Redacted> (I don't know her, the messages that Reid read clearly illustrated that) and demanded the password for my cell phone. At this point I asked to speak to a supervisor. This was when I spoke to Mr Mailoux, who told me that if I did not provide the password, my phone would be seized and sent to Ottawa for evaluation. He said that MacDonald believed that I was meeting a \"girl of questionable age\" and that all of my digital and analog media was suspect. I provided the password, there was nothing illegal on my phone, my iPod, my (now broken) tablet, my laptop, or any of the 20 or so VHS tapes that were meticulously scrutinized, and two cameras and their SD cards, which I cannot locate at the moment as my personal belongs were COMPLETELY RANSACKED and scattered inside of my vehicle! <Girls Name Redacted> gave her age as 21 on Twitter, and I had no reason to doubt her, we had only kicked around the idea of possibly meeting, and she warned me that her \"social anxiety\" might keep her home. So when Ms Reid asked if I knew anyone, or if I was meeting someone, my 100% honest answer was and still is \"NO\" Since Reid had obviously read the same messages, she knew all of this before asking, and my answers confirmed exactly what the messages said, regardless, she accused me of lying. About 45min later I was told that a \"weapon\" had been found in my car and that it had been seized, I could only get my car back if I paid $500.\n\nWhen I asked for the documents, Mr. MacDonald said that he already gave them to me. I knew this was not the case, the only place I could put the documents was in the car that was not in my possession. I was wearing swim-trunks, sandals and a pocketless T-Shirt, the documents were NOT in my possession! Only after asking for a supervisor did he provide me with \"copies\" of the forms.\n\nThe \"weapon\" in question is some sort of tool, although I cannot tell you what kind. It was in a box of tools that I borrowed to repair the door handle on my car, and it got left behind after the chore was finished. I never used it, just removed it to get to another tool, and did not return it to the box of loaner tools.\n\nThe replacement handles were also in the car at the time, and so was the broken one that had been replaced. The tool was in the door handle pocket with a pinball and a pack of matches, all just miscellaneous odds and ends that I found under the seats last time I vacuumed the car. It was a random piece of \"junk\" that wound up being put in the door handle. The item is NOT BRASS KNUCKLES, it is not brass, and there are only 2 rings on it, and they pivot from side to side I do not know what it is, I do know that it is NOT a WEAPON, and that I have never used it as a either a tool or a weapon.\n\nWhen I asked Mr Mailloux (the \"supervisor\") for his name, he said \"I will get you a card\" and he did, although the card had no name on it. His name was clearly on his uniform, so while there was no attempt to \"hide\" his identity, the card 'trick' seemed like he was trying to \"pull something\". Clearly there is distrust on both sides at this point.\n\nSince a don't know what the tool even is and it would be expensive to ship due to it's weight, I would simply like to appeal the $500 that was demanded to return my vehicle. What ever the tool is, as I do not know what it is, I have no use for it. What I DO have a use for is the $500 that I was forced to pay for the return of my vehicle.\n\nMy arrest in 1988 was disclosed to Reid, it was 25+ years old and was dismissed. This has not been an issue my previous 3 visits to Canada.\n\nSo ummmm any ideas"}

However, his weak 3.1 YPC this season reveals more of his NFL ability than his college success and 3rd-overall draft status.

(Reuters photo: Kevin Lamarque)\n\nA strange controversy in Texas\n\nTexas has passed a regulation requiring that human corpses be disposed of in accordance with the state's regulation for the disposal of human corpses. That this exercise in tautology was necessary \u2014 and that it is controversial \u2014 is a reminder that we live in the golden age of mass delusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe underlying question here, which properly understood isn't a question at all, has to do with abortion, and what it is that an abortion does. The biological answer to that question is straightforward: An abortion is a procedure in which a physician or another party kills a living human organism, either prior to birth or in the course of inducing a birth. About the three relevant criteria \u2014 1) living, 2) human, 3) organism \u2014 there is no serious question: The tissue is living tissue, not dead tissue; it is human tissue, not rutabaga or koala bear tissue; it is arranged into an individual organism rather than an organ or a tumor or an extension of the maternal body.\n\nBecause the biology is straightforward, maintaining the fiction that abortion is something other than the premeditated killing of a living human being requires a retreat into poorly wrought metaphysics. The same people who will lecture you about science eight days a week inexplicably embrace pre-modern superstitious notions of \"ensoulment\" and work up some fine angels-dancing-on-the-head-of-a-pin material about \"personhood,\" the legal construction one uses when one is trying one's best not to notice that what happens in an abortion is killing and that what is killed is a distinct and individual human being.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe abortion ethic is based on a lie: that the procedure involves nothing more than the elimination of a meaningless clump of cells. That lie is bound up in a nest of lies of which it is one particularly poisonous constituent, all of which are aimed at denying the relationship between sex and procreation or at denying the deep and wide-ranging consequences of attempting to disrupt that relationship. And that larger tangle of lies is itself only a constituent of an even more sprawling mess of confusion and deceit holding that men and women are interchangeable social units, that motherhood and fatherhood are social fictions that were dreamt up rather than evolved, and that you, Sunshine, and your desires are the very center of this universe.\n\nThe dead baby in the surgical tray makes all that nonsense rather hard to sustain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTexas governor Greg Abbott approved a proposal yesterday that would forbid treating the bodies of the dead like used bandages or other medical waste, instead requiring that they be cremated or buried. The burials, if they come to pass, will be surreal affairs. What would one say? Would the mother attend?\n\nThe rule does not apply to miscarriages or to \"abortions that take place at home,\" presumably a reference to pharmaceutically induced abortions.\n\nYes, the Texas rule is transparent: It is a transparent attempt to force Texans to face reality.\n\nThe abortion lobby is apoplectic, which is what it always is, which must get exhausting. NARAL Pro-Choice Texas protests that the move is a \"transparent\" attempt to burden abortionists. \"The rules target physicians that provide abortions and the hospitals that care for patients,\" says Blake Rocap, the lawyer for the group. \"Transparent\" is a funny choice of word: NARAL is an organization that refuses even to say its own name \u2014 it is formerly the National Abortion Rights Action League \u2014 or to acknowledge what sort of \"choice\" it is advocating.\n\nYes, the Texas rule is transparent: It is a transparent attempt to force Texans to face reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt probably will not prevent (at least not directly) a single abortion from taking place, and, though the particulars of their condition is unknowable, it seems unlikely that a grave or a dignified cremation will make the victims feel any better about having had their lives snuffed out before they had had a chance to take a breath, much less to take a step or fall in love. The dead, Private Joker informs us, know only one thing: that it is better to be alive \u2014 though Christians, who in one month will celebrate the Feast of the Holy Innocents, take a different view. Whichever story is closer to the truth, death is death is death.\n\nBut our children are not garbage. Not the living ones, and not the dead, as resolute as their parents may be in treating them as though they were. Reality will not be denied. Not for very long. Not in Texas. Not anywhere."}

(WBRE/WYOU Staff Photo)\n\nWILKES BARRE, LUZERNE COUNTY (WBRE/WYOU) - Luzerne County elections officials were scrambling Tuesday after receiving a barrage of complaints about the county's electronic voting machine turning Republican votes for Donald Trump to votes for Hillary Clinton.\n\nEyewitness News was the first to report the problem early Tuesday morning after more than a score of voters contacted us saying that when they checked the straight-party Republican ticket option on their voting machine all the GOP candidates were checked - except Trump. Instead, Hillary Clinton's name appeared as their selection.\n\n\"If you click on Republican,\" says \"Becky\", a Dallas voter. \"Hillary was automatically picked and moved to the next screen. I went back to change it and it wouldn't let me. I had to have someone come over and reset my scree. She said that it happened to someone earlier.\"\n\n\"I now believe that this is rigged!\", she wrote Eyewitness News.\n\n\"My concern is I was smart enough to realize that after making three separate attempts to try to complete my ballot,\" says Lorraine of Pittston Township \"the machine was trying to cast it for me. I stopped and called for help.\"\n\nElection officials initially told us that they had received no word of the problem, then conceded about an hour later there was a problem.\n\n\"We've gotten several calls,\" Luzerne County Election Bureau Solicitor Mike Butera told us just before 11:00 a.m.. Initially, they said the problems appeared to be related to \"voter error\" \"We sent technicians to every polling place where we received a complaint. We found no vote flipping at all. We have found some machine glitches, which were fixed.\"\n\nWhile the problem seemed most troublesome in the Butler Township, Drums and Rock Glen precincts, it soon began appearing elsewhere around the county.\n\nEyewitness News has learned the problem appears to be more widespread, however, with the same \"glitch\" being reported in Columbia, Carbon and Monroe Counties and in other parts of central Pennsylvania.\n\nElections officials say in each case they've been made aware of, the voter was able to cast an accurate vote for the candidate of their choice - saying there was no \"vote flipping\" occurring at the polling stations.\n\nLuzerne County Bureau of Elections Director Marissa Crispell says initially there appeared to be a calibration problem with some machines. \"You might select a straight Democrat party ticket, and it would send you to the Green party. It was an obvious problem, which was easily fixed when brought to the attention of poll workers.\"\n\nOfficials also indicated some of the problem might be due to \"voter error\" as many voters aren't familiar with the wide variety of electronic voting machines being used in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe problems in Luzerne County are indicative of the suspicion many voters have in the outcome of the 2016 election, especially the presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Trump has campaigned for weeks on what he's called a \"rigged election\".\n\nEarlier in the day, Pennsylvania Secretary of State Pedro Cortes dismissed Trump's allegations, telling Eyewitness News during a live interview from the state capitol in Harrisburg that Pennsylvania has a good, secure voting system.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that it has been some of the talk of this election, he said. \"Pennsylvania has a very good history of running elections that are fair, that are smooth, that you can trust.

For instance, if the federal government decided to slap a 10 percent surtax on marijuana sales rather than a tobacco-style per-pound tax, that $500 million excise tax figure would grow to $5.3 billion.\n\nAs German Lopez points out over at Vox, these figures account for just a tiny slice of annual government spending in the United States, so don't expect to balance your state budget on the backs of marijuana smokers any time soon.\n\n[Something interesting happens to weed after it's legal]\n\nStill, $28 billion is nothing to scoff at. The Tax Foundation analysis points out that marijuana tax revenues in Colorado and Washington are exceeding projections by a considerable margins. Colorado initially projected it would receive $70 million in annual taxes on marijuana sales and excise taxes, but it is on track to pull in $140 million this year. The money goes to fund things like school construction and drug abuse-prevention campaigns.\n\nCritics point out that marijuana legalization carries some social costs too as people may become more likely to abuse the drug and suffer the negative consequences of abuse and addiction, if the drug is more widely available.\n\nBut as the Tax Foundation analysis points out, people are already using and abusing marijuana -- regardless of legality. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, over 13 percent of Americans age 12 and older, 0r 35 million people, used marijuana in 2014. And 4.2 million of them met criteria for substance abuse or dependence.\n\nWe're already paying the social cost of marijuana abuse, in other words. Increased tax revenues could help offset those costs.\n\nAnd marijuana prohibition carries a whole host of costs of its own -- roughly a half-billion dollars a year to arrest people for simple marijuana possession. Billions more to arrest and prosecute people who sell and traffic the drug. And the difficult-to-quantify cost of restricting the ability of millions of people who would prefer to use a drug that, by any reasonable metric, is considerably less harmful than alcohol.\n\nMore from Wonkblog:\n\nHow police took $53,000 from a Christian band, an orphanage and a church\n\nStoned drivers are a lot safer than drunk ones, new federal data show\n\nThese 'marijuana goggles' are supposed to make you feel stoned"}

It's the first time a top draft prospect has been shut out of the Big 3 of kicks corporations.\n\nThat's because LaVar Ball has pushed for a co-branded partnership with whichever company intends to sign him, which would allow Big Baller Brand to operate underneath the parent umbrella. That's like Jordan Brand, which signs athletes and has its own sneaker line as part of the Nike family.\n\nBall has also set the bar high, claiming he and his sons will settle for no less than a combined $1 billion deal over the life of the contract. That prompted Nike CEO Phil Knight to call Ball's asking price \"a bit steep,\" and company consultant George Raveling to call Ball himself \"the worst thing to happen to basketball in the last hundred years.\"\n\nLonzo Ball is projected as the No. 2 overall pick in the upcoming draft after an impressive freshman season leading the UCLA Bruins to a Sweet 16 appearance in the NCAA tournament.\n\nHow does that price tag compare with other NBA stars' footwear?\n\nIt would rank Lonzo ahead of the league's stars with the priciest basketball kicks out.\n\nLeBron James' LeBron XIV retails at $175, with the customizable XIV iD series ringing up $220 before tax. Kevin Durant's latest KD9 comes in at $150, while James Harden's Harden Vol. 1 Series with Adidas run $140.

Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) to call his chamber \"the most anti-environment House in history.\" Here are the 10 most powerful and outspoken opponents of clean air, clean water, conservation and climate action.\n\n10. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Thought to be the biggest lifetime recipient of oil-industry contributions in the Senate, Cornyn has rewarded Exxon-Mobil's largesse by supporting the industry's position on pretty much every energy or environmental issue that has ever appeared before him. That's why he, like everyone on this list, has a \"0\" on the League of Conservation Voters' scorecard for pro-environment votes.\n\n9. Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska. A tireless advocate for opening Alaska's pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, Young was involved in one of the more entertaining name-calling spats in Congress this year when he got into a tiff over the refuge with author and professor Doug Brinkley. You can be the judge of who won by watching the video replay.\n\n8. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista. There may have been a time when the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee lived up to its name, investigating and bringing to light incidents of government waste, fraud and abuse. But I can't remember back that far. In recent decades it has served as a tool for the majority party in the House to bash and embarrass the presidential administration, at least during times such as now when the House isn't controlled by the president's party. Issa, the committee's current chairman, has turned such political gamesmanship into an art form, and has been particularly keen to attack environmental regulators and policymakers. In so doing he has turned up precious little waste or fraud, but provided plenty of political theater for those who want to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency or end subsidies for clean energy.\n\n7. Rep. Bob Latta, R-Ohio. Latta has the distinction of sponsoring the most far-reaching and destructive amendment to the most egregious anti-environment bill passed by the House this year. The TRAIN Act, approved by the House in September but not expected to get through the Senate, is a breathtaking (literally) gift to polluters that creates a committee to study the costs but ignore the benefits of environmental regulation, while also blocking EPA efforts to crack down on deadly emissions from power plants. Latta's contribution is an amendment that undermines a cornerstone of the Clean Air Act, requiring the EPA to take industry costs into account when setting health-based standards. This would allow corporate polluters to overrule scientists and strikes at the heart of the polluter-pays principle that has guided environmental policy for 40 years.\n\n6. Rep. Edward Whitfield, R-Ky. Another architect of the TRAIN wreck, Whitfield offered an amendment that would block the EPA from regulating mercury and other toxics from power plants, and from coming up with a rule on smog and soot that crosses state lines. Together, these two regulations would save an estimated 51,000 lives per year. But what are a few thousand lives when utility profits are at stake?\n\n5. Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla. One of the most outspoken climate-change deniers in the Senate (he's renowned for calling global warming \"the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\"), Inhofe is also one of the most influential Republicans in the country when it comes to environmental policy. As ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, he uses his position to push for expanded oil drilling and reduce environmental regulation. Inhofe sometimes even finds himself to the right of the polluter-packed U.S. Chamber of Commerce; this summer he placed a hold on President Obama's nominee John Bryson as Commerce secretary, even though Bryson had the blessing of the Chamber, because Inhofe felt Bryson was too pro-environment.\n\n4. Rep. Michael Simpson, R-Idaho. Simpson has stepped to the front lines of his party's war on Mother Nature by adding dozens of anti-environment riders to must-pass budget legislation. Among other things, Simpson aims to let mountaintop coal-mining operations continue to pollute streams, prevent the EPA from regulating coal-ash disposal, and exempt pesticide sprayers from complying with the Clean Water Act.\n\n3. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. The enforcer of Republican Party discipline, Senate Minority Leader McConnell is among the key architects of his party's stance on environmental issues. In 2009, when Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was among the few Republicans willing to discuss a bipartisan climate bill with Democrats, it was McConnell who reportedly convinced him to back away. This spring he led a failed effort to block the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions and overrule its finding that climate change threatens public health -- tantamount"}

This is the third time the Canadian icon \u2014 a five-time world and Olympic champion and inductee into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame \u2014 has been before the courts on driving related charges. Bailey captured the hearts of Canadians at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he won the gold medal and set a new world record of 9.84 in the 100-metre sprint. Two years later his image was somewhat tarnished. In May 1998, Bailey was fined $200 for failing to report an accident after he left the scene of a single-car cash that totalled his $80,000 Mercedes.\n\nThe car, awarded to him for a gold medal performance at the 1995 track and field championships in Sweden, struck a concrete utility pole, flipped over and caught fire. Bailey emerged from the wreck without injury. Passersby offered to get him medical attention but Bailey refused and asked to be driven home instead. Police arrived at his home five hours later.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nAt the time, Crown Attorney Paul Renwick told the court that a more serious charge of careless driving was withdrawn because there was \"no reasonable prospect of a conviction.\" Bailey was assessed three demerit points over the accident. Three years later, in December 2001, Bailey was convicted of driving a Mercedes-Benz 200 kilometres an hour on the Queen Elizabeth Way and fined $975. An Ontario Provincial Police officer testified he tracked Bailey's black Mercedes doing 200 km/h in the slow lane of the westbound QEW between Mississauga Rd. and Erin Mills Parkway at 3:34 in the morning. Bailey lived in Oakville at the time, but apparently has since sold his mansion there. \"He runs fast and he drives fast, except now he's going to slow down,\" his lawyer Paul Stunt said as he left court. Bailey was at a track meet in Italy at the time and did not appear in court. Under the Highway Traffic Act Bailey lost six demerit points but his licence was not suspended. After his racing career ended Bailey started his own company called DBX Sport Management, which helps amateur athletes find ways to promote themselves, and a sports injury clinic in Oakville, Ont. If convicted of the current charge Bailey faces a fine and licence suspension."}

{"id": 36, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "The simplest sports betting math many punters possess is the ability to convert odds and calculate break even percentages, also known as implied probabilities. After spending years doing these calculations, first on a windows calculator, and later in an excel spread sheet, I finally developed the Intense Gambling odds converter you'll find below.\n\nOdds Converter Tool\n\n[oddscalc]\n\nIn case you're not familiar with the difference between American Odds called moneylines and European odds, which are in decimal format, here is how each works.\n\nAmerican Odds\n\nAlso known as moneylines, are offered as either a positive or negative number. When positive, the moneyline represents how much profit a punter stands to make on a $100 stake. To give an example, a line of +125 represents risk $100 to win $125 profit. Negative moneylines represent how much a punter needs to stake for a winning bet to profit $100. A moneyline of -235 is risk $235 to win $100 profit.\n\nEuropean Odds\n\nAlso known as decimal odds, represent how much a winning ticket is worth for each dollar staked. For example if a punter wagers $10.00 at odds 1.95 and wins, their payout is $10 x 1.95 = $19.50. A major difference between American and European odds is that while the American version is based on profit, the European version is based on return. Likewise, a $10 wager on odds 1.95 translates to risk $10.00 to potentially profit $9.50. Considering 1.95 pays less than even money, it would be expressed in American odds format as a negative moneyline.\n\nThe best way to convert American odds to European format, and vice versa, is to use the \"odds converter\" located above. For those of you interested in the math, I'll cover it great detail later in this article. First let me discuss break even percentage and implied probability.\n\nImplied Probability\n\nIs how often a bet must win for it to have neutral value. To give the simplest example, take American odds +100 (which is the equivalent of 2.00 in European odds) where winning bets are paid even money, here the implied probability is 50%. This is because in American format risk $100 to win $100, and in European format stake $1 to return $2, you'll need to win an average of 50% of the time to break even over the long haul.\n\nWhere our odds converter comes in handy is let's say you've done an analysis on a game between the Boston Red Sox and Tampa Bay Rays and determined the Red Sox should be 57% favorites in this game. After price shopping, the best odds you can find on the Red Sox are -128, which in European format is 1.781. There are now two ways you can determine if you've found a good bet. The first method is to plug 57% into our odds converter under the required break even field. Doing this you'll find at 57% the true odds in American format are -132.6 (1.754 European). Consider you're getting better than this with the -128 (1.781 European) you have a profitable bet.\n\nThe second way you could approach the above problem, is to plug -128 into our odds converted under American odds. Here you'll see the required break even rate (implied probability) is 56.14%. Considering your calculation of a 57% win probability comes out higher than the win rate needed to break even, you've find yourself a good bet.\n\nSports Betting Strategy You Should, but Most Don't, Understand\n\nFor those with basic sports betting math skills, the sample problem I'm about to give will be easy to solve. If you're stumped, or answer incorrectly, what you're about to read could very well be what gets you on the path required to winning consistently at sports betting.\n\nThe sample\n\nEvery online betting site with odds on a NBA basketball game between the Orlando Magic and Sacramento Kings has the odds listed in American format as Magic -545 / Kings +445.\n\nSomeone comes long and says \"I'll offer you either Magic -490 or Kings +490, your choice\". Which of these options, if any, has the highest expected value?\n\nThe way many sports bettors would approach this is to average out 545 and 445 and figure the fair value is about -495 / +495. Using this failed logic they'd end up taking the Magic -490 as that's better than the fair price and must be +EV. The problem is neither American nor European odds work this way; they can't be averaged out to calculate the fair value.\n\nThe first step those who understand sports betting math take to solve this problem is the conversion of Magic -545 / Kings +445 to break even percentages.\n\nAfter plugging the odds"}
{"id": 37, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Question. Hi Mike: Is there a way to use fireplace ash that would be beneficial to my garden or lawn? If not, what is the best way to dispose of the stuff? ---Chris in Berwyn, PA (formerly Newport, RI)\n\nMike: Like many of my neighbors here in Eastern Carolina, I have a 'burn pile' where I dispose of storm debris, old trimmed branches (mainly pine and oak) and all manner of other garden/yard items. My question is: Is the leftover ash good for anything? I know better than to put it in the compost pile. Thanks,\n\n---Doug in Beaufort, NC\n\nAnswer. Thank you, Doug. As you note, I've long cautioned gardeners not to include anything other than very small quantities of wood ash in a compost pile\u2014a little of this highly alkaline material goes a long way. But those of us with naturally acidic soils can (and should) use much larger amounts on our lawns and gardens\u2014as a substitute for lime.\n\nBefore we get to that, however, I'd like to take a moment to try and pry your incendiary little fingers away from those piles. Yes, we guys love to set stuff on fire\u2014especially in the name of 'yard work'. But such burning fouls the air, adds greenhouse gases we don't need, and wastes lots of nutrients. Pile up your \"garden/yard\" items and they'll turn into nice compost, especially with lots of leaves in the mix. Stack the branches on the outskirts of your property to provide habitat for toads, birds and other beneficials. (And you'll find a surprising amount of compost at the bottom of those piles after a few years.) If you can't go completely 'burn turkey', consider cutting back to one small bonfire a year to satisfy your inner firebug, and get better use out of the rest of that wood.\n\nAnd good quality hardwood ashes\u2014that means no ashes from BBQ grills, cardboard, plywood, painted, or pressure treated wood\u2014do have real agricultural use. (Softwoods have a lot less value, but you shouldn't be burning soft wood in a stove or fireplace anyway.) The best information on how to properly utilize the valuable material in wood ash is contained in a couple of great farm-scale articles from the Georgia Extension Service and the government of Alberta's department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. We'll post links to those articles at this end of this Q of the Week for those of you who want all the details.\n\nTo help put the advice into garden-size perspective, we turned to Julia Gaskin, a Land Application Specialist for the University of Georgia Extension Service who recently updated their wood ash information article. She explains that ash from good quality hardwoods contains a very nice amount of potassium; at least 3% by weight. Also known as potash, this is the \"K\" in the fabled N-P-K scale of plant nutrients\u2014the Dow Jones of Horticulture! Potash improves root health and strengthens the very cellular structure of plants, helping them resist all kinds of stresses.\n\nWood Ash also contains lots of micronutrients, and, on average, 15% calcium\u2014a nutrient often lacking in many of our soils and fertilizers. Ashes even improve the structure and tilth of soils. But they must be used with care, as all that calcium makes them highly alkaline\u2014a range of 9 to 13\u2014and they WILL change your soil's pH. But that's OK, because that's exactly what you going to be using them to do.\n\nSo the first thing you need is a soiltest. I know\u2014I always say that. And I'm always right! This time double, because you'll be using those ashes to actively change the pH of your soil and you need to know where you're starting from.\n\nAll soil tests report pH\u2014the measure of your soil's acidity or alkalinity. The center of this scale is the number 7, the scientific neutral. I say 'scientific', because most plants prefer soil to be a little acidic, around 6.5, for good growth. Some of our most popular plants, however, require a highly acidic soil (in the 4 to 5.5 range) to survive: azaleas, rhododendrons, blueberries, mums, marigolds, mountainlaurel, oak,pecan and sweet potato to name a few. Keep your alkaline ashes far away from these and other acid lovers.\n\nBut many parts of the country\u2014especially areas with heavy rainfall\u2014have soils that are naturally down in that highly acidic range, which your regular plants do not enjoy one bit. Normally people use lime to correct this, which is why soil test results often include a \"liming recommendation\", specifying how many pounds of lime per thousand square feet to add to your lawn or garden to bring the pH up to around"}

{"id": 49, "ended": true, "length": 1019, "text": "In 1963, Lynda Gunn was asked by her grandfather, a private-school athletic director in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, to model for a buddy of his who was a painter. Gunn, who was eight years old at the time, spent a few sessions wearing a fancy white dress and standing stock still in a walking position\u2014her feet were balanced on wooden blocks to simulate the appearance of being in motion\u2014being sketched and photographed by Norman Rockwell. Rockwell used her image in his celebrated work \"The Problem We All Live With\": the painting depicts Ruby Bridges, who in 1960 became the first African-American girl to enroll in an all-white Southern elementary school. In it, Gunn-as-Bridges approaches her first day of school flanked by federal marshals, the wall behind her defaced by a graffito slur. Last summer, President Obama requested that the painting, which is in the collection of the Norman Rockwell Museum, in Stockbridge, be loaned to the White House, where it was displayed on a wall outside the Oval Office.\n\nGunn, a taciturn, thoughtful woman who works as a night auditor at the Super 8 Motel in Lee, Massachusetts, was invited to New York recently, to view a series of paintings by Philip Maysles, which are hanging on the wall of the Red Rooster, a restaurant in Harlem owned by Marcus Samuelsson. In one, Maysles\u2014who is the son of Albert Maysles, the documentarian\u2014has drawn \"The Problem We All Live With\" as it appeared while on exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, complete with a book for comments, in 2006. (A reproduction of the Houston comments book\u2014\"The more things change the more they stay the same\"; \"Security keeps following us\"\u2014is provided at the Red Rooster. Guests are invited to contribute their own comments, in a different color ink.) In another, he has drawn Gunn, schoolbooks in hand, being carefully positioned by her father, David Gunn, Jr., in Rockwell's book-lined studio. Another painting, a rendering of Rockwell's famous self-portrait in which Rockwell's face on the canvas has been replaced by Gunn's profile, is, Maysles said, his own oblique self-portrait. Over lunch with Gunn and Jane Allen Petrick, a writer who is working on a book about the real people of color whom Rockwell used as models, and who had initiated the encounter, Maysles explained, \"A lot of my work is exploring white identity, and how whiteness is constructed in relation to images people have of black folk.\"\n\nGunn told Maysles that, like Ruby Bridges, she had been the only black child in her elementary school, though for different sociological reasons. Her family had been in Stockbridge for generations, and her grandfather was a well-known figure in the community. \"It was a very sheltered experience\u2014I just got to be a child,\" she said. Although members of her family were active in the N.A.A.C.P., she did not feel affected by the nation's larger racial tensions until she was older. The only time she felt singled out for being different was when her classmates read \"Little Black Sambo.\" \"Everyone would turn around and look at me,\" she said. \"But it wasn't traumatic. It was just a moment.\" As an adult, she found that her Yankee accent provided a measure of cultural camouflage. \"I've gotten a lot of job interviews\u2014on the phone, it's one thing, but when I show up, the jaws drop,\" she said.\n\nAt the Red Rooster, Gunn was f\u00eated. The kitchen sent out complimentary pumpkin soup and macaroni-and-cheese; a hefty cookbook was pressed upon her; Samuelsson stopped by to grasp her hand. Gunn said she was honored to have participated in the making of an icon, though she admitted she would have preferred royalties over the ten dollars per session that she was paid by Rockwell.

Office politics, cited by just over 39% of respondents, was a close second.\n\nHarvard Business Review (HBR) Ascend surveyed approximately 1,700 people aged between 18 and 34 from various industries in India to understand the challenges they encounter at work. Among millennials, \"the more tenured group (aged between 25-34) felt that excessive workload is their top barrier (42.92% respondents), while the younger millennials (18-24 years) identified office politics (42.39% of the respondents) as the main pain point,\" Vivek Chachra, India manager, Harvard Business Publishing, noted in a press release. The workload was a bigger concern for men, while it was office politics for women, the survey found. It is important to note, however, that women represented a smaller proportion (22.17%) of the entire pool.\n\nMoreover, though most Indian millennials are equipped with technical skills, the survey suggests that they lack four key building blocks for a successful career: emotional intelligence, stress management, persuasion, and analytical thinking. Only 13% of the respondents thought they displayed emotional intelligence at work. A dismal 8% felt analytical thinking \"is an area of strength for them,\" and a meagre 4.5% \"agreed that they had the persuasion skills needed to be successful at the workplace,\" the survey noted.\n\nIn systems plagued by rote learning, academic excellence has always been the top, if not the only, priority. Consequently, soft skills have taken a backseat at schools and higher education institutes in India. And HBR Ascend isn't alone in noting such a deficit. Studies by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and global management consultancy Hay Group have found that a lack of soft skills has impeded communication, self-awareness, and self-management among India's workforce.\n\nAnd the struggle is likely to worsen as office landscapes change.\n\n\"Soft skills like empathy, emotional intelligence, and persuasion will be even more critical as workspaces become more dynamic and machine-human interplay rapidly evolves,\" Amit Aggarwal, senior vice-president of learning & development at Genpact, a global business process management and services firm, said in a statement."}

{"id": 59, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "At a site near the Southwest Alaska village of Quinhagak archaeologists are racing against time to uncover Yup'ik artifacts before the effects of climate change cause them to erode into the sea. The old village continues to reveal artifacts that give a glimpse into the daily lives of Yup'ik people hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe crowning artifact found this season, says Rick Knecht, the lead archaeologist and a professor from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, is a mask \u2014 half human, half walrus \u2014 in nearly perfect condition. It's wrapped in several layers of plastic as Knecht keeps the mask damp and cool in a refrigerator at base camp.\n\n\"It's got amazingly lifelike contours with the cheek bones, and the nose, and the forehead and so on. Beautifully carved out of wood, and as you can see it's got two little conical tusks that represent that transformation into a walrus. And these are in fact made out of walrus ivory. It's got a little beard here, and half of it are human hairs and then on the other half are sea mammal hairs, maybe walrus whiskers,\" said Knecht.\n\n\nKnecht says the mask could have been a used by a Shaman. He unearthed it, about five miles outside Quinhagak, on the edge of the Bering Sea, where archaeologists have spent the six field seasons scraping dirt from the remains of a 500-year old Alaska Native sod house. Today's discovery of a wooden bowl gives another clue about how Yup'ik people lived.\n\n\"On the bottom of the bentwood bowl is an ownership mark left by the person who carved that and these ownership marks were inherited between families. We have about six or seven ownership marks we see consistently throughout this site, which we believe was a very large sod house divided up into compartments which were domestic spaces for women and children,\" said Knecht.\n\nHis team has found tens of thousands of household items, jewelry and weapons, among other things. The dig is composed of what's left of an entire village at the site of the ancient community of Arolik.\n\nThe objects look much younger than the centuries they've endured. That's because they've been encased in permafrost. Wood and leather items can survive for hundreds of years. The oldest objects date as far back as seven hundred years.\n\nUnseasonably warm temperatures at the dig site\u2013 nearly 80 degrees- create another set of variables for the crew to deal with. Conditions that Knecht say are driving the crew to work as fast as possible before more washes away.\n\nIn the early 1600s, right around the time that Shakespeare was publishing plays and poems in England, Knecht says, these people were crafting art too: carving intricate ivory jewelry and weaving baskets. Then, in the middle of the 17thCentury, says Knecht, their communal, sod house was attacked and burned.\n\nCarlotta Hillerdal is a co-investigator with Knecht on the project. Back at the dig, she points to a burnt orange streak running along the dark soil of the dig's dirt wall.\n\n\"This site was abandoned around 1640. So that's where we have the kind of orange and black soil that you see in the wall over there that we dug. That's the roof of the last phase of the structure that stood here that was burnt down and abandoned,\" said Hillerdal.\n\nThe evidence at the site corresponds with local Yup'ik lore about the 'bow and arrow wars,' a time of fighting between tribes during an earlier climate change that strained resources.\n\nThose are stories that Yup'ik elder Annie Cleveland knows. She says, when she was a girl, she remembers walking on the beach just outside of her village and finding old spears and human remains along the shore.\n\n\"When my grandmother and I used to walk down the beach to get some driftwood or pick berries we used to find spear-anek (spears) and maybe a human bone and skull and we used to put the bones back up there and dig a little bit and cover them,\" said Cleveland.\n\nThat spot where she and her grandmother kept reburying things has turned into the dig called Nunalleq, meaning 'old village'. Cleveland says the project is bringing to life history for Yup'ik people in her village and giving them a sense of pride. The Native corporation in Quinhagak eventually wants to develop eco-tourism around the site, but rapid erosion has made getting artifacts out the priority.\n\nAs they dig, researchers are finding that the village is larger than expected. With the new discoveries they've tacked on another season of fieldwork to unearth more history before it's too late.\n\nThe archaeologists will ship the artifacts to Scotland for study and preservation before they return them to the region.

{"id": 60, "ended": true, "length": 556, "text": "A smorgasbord of early concept art and animation detailing Naughty Dog's early vision for Uncharted has been revealed.\n\nIn a feature at The Verge, Uncharted writer Josh Scherr goes over Naughty Dog's thought process at the time and includes the original pitch video for Uncharted - then codenamed Project Big - that sold the title to Sony.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshot below, Nathan Drake sure looked a lot different in these early stages. His face was more plucky, cartoonish and expressive.\n\nThen the studio cast a then unknown character actor named Nolan North for the part and everything changed. \"When Nolan came in, it was fairly clear that he was going to be the one,\" Scherr reminisced. \"He had that right kind of devil may care feel to his voice, but he could also get serious when he needed to. And most importantly, as we discovered, is that the guy was hilarious.\"\n\nNorth was also able to provide motion capture and he had the perfect physicality for the role. One of the features Scherr was most proud of was \"additive animation\" meaning the animations would change based on context. For example, Drake sprints differently when he's being shot at versus when he's not. In danger, he'll panic and flail his arms around wildly whereas when he's leisurely running he'll remain cool and collected. \"It looks very simple now compared to [how it looked] back then,\" Scherr said. \"But we were doing a lot of things that we had never tried before.\"\n\nNot everything from the pitch video made it into the final game. The underwater bits were cut, as was the multi-enemy hand-to-hand combat system where you could steal weapons from foes. Amazingly, the jet ski level was built in less than a month at the 11th hour.\n\nNaughty Dog's biggest aspiration with Uncharted was design a game where the narrative was front and center, rather than a flimsy excuse for action sequences. \"The thing that we wanted to focus on from the get-go were characters and story,\" Scherr said. \"That was something we felt that - particularly back in 2005, 2006 when this first started getting developed - was something that was sort of an afterthought in the majority of video games out there. So we really wanted not only to tell this pulpy, action adventure-style thing, but also really try to develop some relatable, entertaining characters and have the story be what pulled you through the game.\"\n\nUncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection will be out on 9th October and will include access to the Uncharted 4 multiplayer beta running from 4th-13th December."}

Catlin, a lawyer who recently represented Assange, said the sex assault investigation into the WikiLeaks founder is based on claims he didn't use condoms during sex with two Swedish women.\n\nSPONSORED\n\nSwedish prosecutors told AOL News last week that Assange was not wanted for rape as has been reported, but for something called \"sex by surprise\" or \"unexpected sex.\"\n\nOne accuser, Anna Ardin, may have \"ties to the US-financed anti-Castro and anti-communist groups,\" according to Israel Shamir and Paul Bennett, writing for CounterPunch.\n\nWhile in Cuba, Ardin worked with the Las damas de blanco (the Ladies in White), a feminist anti-Castro group.\n\nProfessor Michael Seltzer pointed out that the group is led by Carlos Alberto Montaner who is reportedly connected to the CIA.\n\nShamir and Bennett also describe Ardin as a \"leftist\" who \"published her anti-Castro diatribes (see here and here) in the Swedish-language publication Revista de Asignaturas Cubanas put out by Miscel\u00e1neas de Cuba.\"\n\nShamir and Bennett noted that Las damas de blanco is partially funded by the US government and also counts Luis Posada Carriles as a supporter.\n\nA declassified 1976 document (.pdf) revealed Posada to be a CIA agent. He has been convicted of terrorist attacks that killed hundreds of people.\n\nArdin is \"a gender equity officer at Uppsula University \u2013 who chose to associate with a US funded group openly supported by a convicted terrorist and mass murderer,\" FireDogLake's Kirk James Murphy observed.\n\nIn August, Assange told Al-Jazeera that the accusations were \"clearly a smear campaign.\"\n\n\"We have been warned that, for example, the Pentagon is planning on using dirty tricks to destroy our work,\" Assange told the Swedish daily newspaper Aftonbladet.\n\nThe WikiLeaks founder said he was told to be careful of \"sex traps.\" Had Assange fallen for one of those traps? \"Maybe. Maybe not,\" he said.\n\nCatlin observed that both Ardin and Sofia Wil\u00e9n, the second accuser, sent SMS messages and tweets boasting of their conquests following the alleged \"rapes.\"\n\n\"In the case of Ardin it is clear that she has thrown a party in Assange's honour at her flat after the 'crime' and tweeted to her followers that she is with the 'the world's coolest smartest people, it's amazing!'\" he wrote.\n\n\"The exact content of Wil\u00e9n's mobile phone texts is not yet known but their bragging and exculpatory character has been confirmed by Swedish prosecutors. Niether Wil\u00e9n's nor Ardin's texts complain of rape,\" Catlin said.\n\nArdin has also published a seven step guide on how to get revenge on cheating boyfriends.\n\nWhen the charges were first leveled in August, Gawker raised doubts that Ardin was working for the CIA.\n\n\"If anything, Ardin's outing tends to undercut Assange's conspiracy theory that one of his accusers is a major figure on Sweden's left fringe, freewheelingly indiscreet on her personal blog and, until her charges, an enthusiastic promoter of Assange's visit to the country,\" Gawker wrote.\n\nAfter Interpol issued a digital \"wanted\" poster for Assange on Monday morning, an unnamed Scotland Yard source reportedly told Press Association it had been given the documents needed for the arrest. Police would not comment on the report publicly.\n\nSeveral British news outlets speculated that Assange could be arrested as early as Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday evening, Mark Stephens, Assange's London lawyer, was negotiating with British authorities over an arrest warrant they'd received from their Swedish counterparts. Assange has vowed to fight extradition."}

He was utterly confused, and thank God he told me about it, because otherwise he would have thought someone on the set of CHiPs was writing erotica and slipping it into his trailer in the hopes that he was enjoying it or give notes or become his prot\u00e9g\u00e9? I don't know. He was like, 'One of these PAs or other writers on the set, someone slipped me some of their work\u2026 and it was really sexy!'\"\n\nBell reveals she briefly considered letting him believe someone on set was slipping him their provocative writing before eventually owning up to it.\n\n\"As he was telling me, I was like, 'Should I let him know that was me, or should I let him think that some gorgeous PA was inspired to write erotica and slipped it under the door of his trailer?'\" Bell said with a laugh. \"The funniest part was that he went all Veronica Mars trying to figure the origin of this erotica. He said, 'I'm looking at it, it's written on a piece of paper, it's just sitting there in my trailer, and I noticed that it's written in shorthand. The person who wrote it used the number two instead of the word 'to,' and the letter 'B' instead of the word 'be.' What I'm going to do is look over the shoulder of anyone who's writing on a notepad on set for the next couple of weeks and see if I can find who is writing in shorthand.' He turned into Veronica Mars to try to figure out the origin of this erotica. It was very funny.\"\n\nBoth Bell and Shepard were impressed with what Thomas was able to put together for the episode. \"It was particularly amusing, especially knowing that my friend Rob had written things like, 'heaving breasts pressed against the cold plastic of the airplane door,'\" Bell said with a laugh. \"It was bizarre.\"\n\nBell knew that it was only a matter of time (and scheduling) before she became involved with iZombie in some way, although she laments that she only had the time to do a voiceover cameo for the episode. \"Friendship is something that's permanently on the books for Rob and I,\" Bell said. \"There's a constant dialogue about projects and when we can work together again.\"\n\nThat could even include another installment of Veronica Mars, which most recently spawned a movie in 2014. However, it sounds like Veronica's next act will bring her back to the small screen.\n\n\"We're definitely still looking for the windows where we could allow Veronica to exist again, whether it's a miniseries or a short-run cable series,\" Bell said. \"The business of this business twists it all a little bit when you are only allowed to do one television series at a time. It's tricky. But we haven't dropped the conversation. It just might end up being a Murder, She Wrote where I'm 80.\"\n\niZombie airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on The CW."}

{"id": 65, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "by Jason Stotts\n\nI think that Leonard Peikoff has done some great things for Objectivism, he is like a demi-Aquinas, but when he talks about sex and sexual issues, it makes me really sad. Frankly, his position on rape is both disgraceful and disgusting. I don't know how anyone of good moral character or intelligence could actually advocate what Peikoff advocated. It is made much worse because Peikoff is someone I respect and I did not expect him to hold such a reprehensible view of rape.\n\nI'm referring, of course, to his recent Podcast question, episode 202 from February 5th, where Peikoff responds to this question:\n\nIs it rape if you obtain sex through fraudulent means? For example a man does not love a woman but tells her he does so that she will have sex with him. Is this the moral equivalent of rape?\n\nHis response is:\n\nWell, if all she needs it three words, \"I love you,\" and you're not saying it, then it's not an issue of rape. You have to determine, here \u2014 before you talk about rape \u2014 what is the context. A woman can give her consent by her presence in certain contexts and that frees the man to have sex regardless of what she then says. I'm thinking of that case of Kobe Bryant where the woman came up some time in the middle of the night, after some drinking, to his bedroom and then when he purported to do something she said, \"No, I don't consent.\" You cannot do that. You have given every evidence that that is what you're going to do and it is too late at that point to say, \"Sorry, but no.\" So, we're assuming it's not that type of case. You actually have created some kind of false identity, she falls for it, and she never would have [had sex with you] otherwise. Well, that's obviously deception. So, in a sense, it is like rape because she is engaging in the act without her actual consent. Without her knowledge means she would not consent to what you're doing, so you're using fraud, and it is a form of having sex by force. But I don't think you could ever make that a legal crime. Because she says she thought you loved her, but you say you didn't say you loved her. But if it came to the law case, how are you going to decide? What is objective? If a woman says, \"He told me that he loved me and he didn't!\" Any defendant can say, \"I indicated that I had a great admiration for her otherwise I wouldn't want to sleep with her, et cetera, et cetera,\" there is no way of adjudicating what emotions he did or didn't feel or what conversation he did or didn't have. But if there is evidence of physical violence, you know, of a context [such as] she didn't know him, she was walking down the street, et cetera. That's a different story. So. that's what I would say. It's fraud, but in the form you present it is not a legal case.\n\nI want to focus, primarily, just on his one claim:\n\nA woman can give her consent by her presence in certain contexts and that frees the man to have sex regardless of what she then says. I'm thinking of that case of Kobe Bryant where the woman came up some time in the middle of the night, after some drinking, to his bedroom and then when he purported to do something she said, \"No, I don't consent.\" You cannot do that. You have given every evidence that that is what you're going to do and it is too late at that point to say, \"Sorry, but no.\"\n\nAnd to make it very clear what I'm objecting to:\n\nA woman can give her consent by her presence in certain contexts and that frees the man to have sex regardless of what she then says.\n\nLeonard Peikoff believes that if a woman were to come to a man's house late at night, dressed sexily, and perhaps drunk, that he should just be able to use her a fuck-toy, even if she says no. Even if she says no. He thinks that the context is sufficient consent and that any other consent is unnecessary. Furthermore, he believes that this consent cannot be withdrawn, which is the most troubling part of his claim.\n\nI agree with Peikoff that a woman in the context described above is communicating something: that she is amenable to sex. I don't even think that one needs to get explicit verbal consent here. I think it would be sufficient to start initiating sexually and see if she responds and take her response as consent. I think it's fair to say that she's consented to at least being propositioned, whether verbally or nonverbally,"}

It's a false statement.\n\n\"We've created over 600,000 jobs already over a very short period of time and it's going to really start catching on now,\" Trump said Tuesday at the White House, flanked by his top advisers and the CEOs who are members of his Business Advisory Council.\n\nHe repeated the statement later at a press conference: \"Already we've created more than almost [sic] 600,000 jobs.\"\n\nOfficial government data does not back up that claim.\n\nAccording to CNNMoney's Trump Jobs Tracker, 317,000 jobs have been created since Trump took office. The president is trying to take credit for nearly double that number of jobs.\n\nThe ultimate authority on how many jobs are created (or lost) each month is the US Labor Department. CNNMoney's 317,000 figure includes how many jobs the Labor Department reported were created in February (219,000) and March (98,000).\n\nA White House spokesman said Trump is including all the job added in January as well (216,000). Trump was only in office for 11.5 days that month.\n\nBut even if you give him all of the gains for January, that still only brings the tally to 533,000 jobs created so far in 2017.\n\nThe math doesn't quite add up to 600,000.\n\nRelated: Check the data yourself with The CNNMoney Trump Jobs Tracker\n\nTrump likes to count job promises\n\nThere's ongoing debate over whether a president should take credit for creating jobs at all. Most of the hiring is done by the private sector. But there's a case to be made that government policies on taxes, regulations, trade, etc. do influence whether businesses want to hire or not.\n\n\"The president's comments touting the administration's economic record accurately reflect the growing optimism about his policies and the future outlook for the country,\" a White House spokesman told CNNMoney.\n\nTrump has frequently said he's influenced companies like Ford, Charter Communications, General Motors and ExxonMobil to hire more workers, even though some of the businesses themselves refuse to give Trump credit for their hiring decisions.\n\nThen there's the fact that some of the jobs these companies are touting as new hires are part of projects that were in the works long before Trump was elected. (CNNMoney has a running fact check of these announcements here).\n\nRelated: U.S. unemployment drops to 4.5%, lowest in decade\n\nTrump vs. Obama\n\nThe bottom line is: Yes, business and consumer optimism has picked up since Trump won the election. That is likely a factor in some hiring decisions by businesses. But the reality is the economy has added an average of 178,000 jobs a month so far this year. That's very close to, and even slightly lower than, the average last year (187,000 a month) when President Obama was in office."}

And whether you like a glass of wine with dinner or a cocktail out with friends, watching your carbohydrate intake doesn't necessarily mean your indulging needs to come to a full stop. There are many low-carb options out there for dieters who like to drink. As with everything, moderation is key. Heavy drinking isn't good for anyone, but having a few carb-conscious cocktails here and there won't hurt. This is especially true when you consider that some of the drinks that made our top 10 list are 100 percent carb-free!\n\nWhy so much liquor? When it comes to low-carb alcohol, distilled spirits are the safest bet. They're virtually all free of carbohydrates, so you only need to worry about what you're mixing them with. But not everyone likes drinking hard liquor, so we've included some dieter-friendly beers and wines, too.\n\nDiet Jack and Coke Obviously, a regular cola would shatter your daily carbohydrate allowance. But diet soda lends itself to numerous carb-free cocktails. This spin on the traditional Jack and Coke simply uses Diet Coke instead. Make! Mix one jigger (1.5 ounces) of whiskey with Diet Coke, and pour over ice. estimated calories (per serving): 100\n\nestimated carbohydrates (per serving): 0 grams\n\nCuba Libre When you're using diet cola, you can make any simple favorite low-carb. Despite its sweet flavor, rum doesn't contain any carbs either. Make! Mix your favorite unflavored rum with diet cola and serve over ice. For an added twist, throw in a piece of lime. estimated calories: 100\n\nestimated carbohydrates (with a twist of lime): <1 gram\n\nCarb-free gin and tonic Gin and tonics are great summertime drinks. They're crisp and cool, but tonic water is loaded with carbs. It contains 32 grams per 12-ounce can! Swap out soda water for your tonic, and you'll get the flavor without hurting your diet efforts. Make! Mix one jigger of gin with soda water, add a squeeze of lemon or lime, and serve over ice. estimated calories: 150\n\nestimated carbohydrates: <1 gram\n\nLow-carb mojito The traditional mojito uses syrup for sweetening, but if you use a diet lemon-lime soda like Diet Sierra Mist or Diet Sprite, you can get the sweetness without the carbs. Make! Mix one jigger of rum with fresh lime juice and diet lemon-lime soda, and pour onto muddled mint leaves. Then pour over ice. estimated calories: 110\n\nestimated carbohydrates: 1.5 grams\n\nMichelob ULTRA Beer doesn't typically make it onto low-carb lists because most kinds are loaded with carbohydrates. Some light beers, however, won't hurt your efforts too much, including Michelob ULTRA. estimated calories: 95\n\nestimated carbohydrates: 2.6 grams\n\nWine Remember, a single glass of wine is about 5 ounces. Pinot grigio If you like your wine cold and refreshing, pinot grigio is a good option without too many carbohydrates. estimated calories: 123\n\nestimated carbohydrates: 3 grams Sauvignon blanc Sauvignon blanc also earns a place on your low-carb wine rack. estimated calories: 120\n\nestimated carbohydrates: 3 grams Red wine If red wine is more your style, pinot noir is another excellent low-carb option. estimated calories: 122\n\nestimated carbohydrates: 3.4 grams\n\nBeck's Premier Light If you need a little more flavor with your bubbles, Beck's light beer might do the trick! It's another one of the beer hall's lower-carb options. estimated calories: 63\n\nestimated carbohydrates: 3.8 grams\n\nLow-carb sea breeze A sea breeze is a fruity, summertime drink, but it doesn't have to be filled with sugar.

Hydra Slayer is a roguelike with a unique combat system, based on old matematical puzzles. The highlights of release 18.0 are the following: A new player race, the Atlanteans . Most characters in Hydra Slayer would meet vulture hydras, who grow one head for every wound they deal to the player. The Atlanteans have been cursed by the gods, and this will happen for all hydras. Will you be able to turn your curse into an advantage? The curse significantly affects the equipment and strategies to use, especially in the first 12 levels. Thanks for Patashu and Nick for the idea! Evolving hydras . They start to appear after level 25. Their resistance to the given weapon material is increased by one after each attack. These are inspired by a (slightly trollish) post by IchigoMait. Previously, each level below Level 12 contained just one special hydra (not counting bloody or dragon variants of standard colors) -- since there are 9 types, some of them will appear just a few times. The new version changes this -- some levels will replace one of the standard ones with another special, and some will almost lack normal hydras and include most of the special types instead. Challenge levels now tend to have two special hydras per level too. One new exotic weapon -- I will leave that for the players to find :) New special graphics for scythes (Atlanteans start with a scythe), hecatoncheires and monkeys. Thanks to tehora for requesting these! Removed some exploits. It is no longer possible to enhance the titanic club easily with the Reforging+Ambidexterity combo (thanks to vo3435 for abusing this). A tighter limit is placed on using time-daggers on mushrooms. Some features have been added to help with \"head draining\" attacks (all hydras for Atlanteans, Vultures for all characters). When fighting head-draining hydras, the number of wounds caused by the hydra's next attack is given in the UI. For other hydras, when you select your shield, \"+1\" is displayed for the hydra whose damage is reduced by your shield. Also, you can now press 'w' in the hydra description, to view the amount of wounds the given hydra would deal for every size. Enchanted Mersenne Twister (when trying to roll a 'good' number of heads) will now take into account that extra heads could be drained. In the cheat mode, shift+H can now also summon equipment. Minor bugfixes: better display of the in-game achievement screen, capital letters accepted in the scores menu, better handling of the app going out of focus, the generation of Giants' weapons in challenge games, crash bug with Vulture + Ambidexterity + Knowledge/Growth, using Twister even though runes are active, inexact calculation of wounds in the PoK algorithm by head drainers, 'use count' for traps, dragons attacking in a wrong direction on non-orientable levels, number of stunned heads is no longer displayed in the PoK hint for large hydras (the algorithm does not care about them anyway), potion of knowledge correctly counting wounds for shadows, capital letters accepted in the scores menu Have fun!

{"id": 72, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Here Is The Best Ruleset For Ultimate: Fouling Out, Stall Clock, And No More Picks\n\nI watch a lot of ultimate: college, club, AUDL, MLU, you name it. I've decided on what I think is the optimal ruleset for ultimate, combining a mish-mash of rules that already exist (this is built, like every rule book, on at least 80% of the existing USAU rules) and a few things that haven't been tried. This is the framework for rules at the highest level of the sport, and many of the features are only feasible for the most important games and tournaments.\n\nThe Field\n\nThe USA Ultimate rules have the field shape right. The real key is the width \u2014 40 yards wide seems just right. It's wide enough so that the offense can change angles, but not so wide that stopping breaks and swings is impossible, as it is in the semi-pro leagues.\n\nProponents of the football-sized field at the pro level laud the benefit of more hucking and more offense, calling it more exciting. I think that sells the spectator public short. You need a balance in every sport between offense and defense \u2014 I like watching offense-only street basketball occasionally, but I would never encourage the NBA to adopt that style. Beautiful defense \u2014 both individual and team \u2014 can be as exciting as beautiful offense, especially for the intermediate or advanced fan.\n\nThe Stall\n\nHaving players count to ten on the mark is obviously not the optimal way to track the stall count. It is way too inconsistent and is one of the most hotly contested calls in the game (\"I said the T of ten!\")\n\nBut the way the pro leagues solve it \u2014 with referees counting silently and inconsistently \u2014 is not great either.\n\nThe solution: a 7-second stall clock, visible to players and fans alike, operated on the sideline. A buzzer goes off if it hits zero. Disc still in the hand of the player? Turnover. A stall clock operator on the sideline presses a button to reset the clock when the disc is thrown/caught.\n\nThis would be a much more consistent and exciting way to watch a stall count unfold.\n\nOfficiating\n\nIf you're coming here hoping for a firm stance on whether we should adopt observers or referees, you will be disappointed. From a spectator point of view, I simply don't think it matters all that much. Players seem split on what they prefer.\n\nReally, the key is to have a trained professional as the official. Whether they are making active rulings or waiting for player calls before adjudicating, there are way, way too many bad officials in ultimate right now. On the whole, the officiating is particularly bad in the AUDL, where each team slaps together a crew of local refs for each game. Like many things in the AUDL, your mileage may vary. Some cities have great refs; others, not so much. I can't believe how often you see a player throw his hands up for a foul call, then get it 3-4 seconds after the play happens.\n\nThe MLU's refs are not always great, either, but they are certainly more consistent.\n\nThere are some very capable observers in the USAU game, and the top tier of observers are the best trained officials in the sport. We need more of them: people who aren't afraid to make a call, who manage the physicality and call infractions when necessary, and who know the rules inside and out.\n\nRegardless, I am thoroughly convinced that top level ultimate should have officials; pure self-officiation has far too many pitfalls, especially for spectator ultimate.\n\nFouls\n\nI think the current USA Ultimate rulebook does a great job of outlining fouls. You can't bump the thrower. You can't slash the arms of a receiver or hold them down as they try to jump. Physicality and contact in the stack is technically disallowed, but is often uncalled by players, observers, and referees alike. The rules seem to have found the sweet spot for a \"non-contact\" sport.\n\nUnfortunately, enforcement leaves a lot to be desired; it's probably the most glaring weakness in the current ruleset. The pro leagues have made an effort to combat fouls with a short yardage penalty, but a 10 yard penalty is so much less significant in ultimate than it is in football. USA Ultimate rules often allow players to get away with repeated, egregious fouls with almost no repercussions. The current TMF/PMF system still lacks teeth, especially when being wielded by inexperienced or timid observers.\n\nIt's time to try a new approach. It would be easy to institute an individual foul limit on players in officiated games. Without in-game testing, it would be hard to know what the 'foul out' number should be, but it would serve as an effective way to stop continued"}

And it was the kind of performance that just a short time ago seemed to risk alienating large numbers of potential viewers but now appears to be making the \"Late Show\" host a very big draw.\n\nColbert lampooned White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who on his tour of the Sunday political talk shows asserted that \"the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.\"\n\n\"Will not be questioned? Let me test that theory,\" Colbert said. \"What the f--- are you talking about?\"\n\nColbert then challenged Miller, who said he is \"prepared to go on any show, anytime, anywhere,\" to appear on Tuesday's \"Late Show.\"\n\n\"Listen, if you don't show up, I'm going to call you a liar,\" Colbert said. \"And if you do show up, I'm going to call you a liar to your face.\"\n\nMiller did not show.\n\nWith forceful remarks like this, Colbert has been gaining on late-night king Jimmy Fallon, who is far less inclined to take on the president in a harsh manner.\n\nConventional wisdom is that Fallon's approach works best on a major broadcast network. When the Hollywood Reporter commissioned a survey of late-night viewers in the fall of 2015, shortly after Colbert's debut on CBS, it found that Fallon appealed to people across the political spectrum. The \"Tonight Show\" host's audience was 36 percent Democrat, 31 percent Republican and 27 percent independent.\n\nColbert's audience skewed sharply to the left: 47 percent Democrat, 17 percent Republican and 31 percent independent.\n\nA liberal slant helped make Colbert a star on Comedy Central, but \"CBS executives made it clear that they expected Mr. Colbert to broaden his appeal when he moved to the medium of late night on a network,\" the New York Times reported at the time of his hiring.\n\nColbert, however, was among Trump's fiercest critics during the campaign and never really moderated his politics. Ratings throughout his first year on the \"Late Show\" were underwhelming, much to the delight of conservative publications such as the Weekly Standard, which in May called Colbert's early struggles \"sweet schadenfreude.\"\n\nFormer Daily Show host Stephen Colbert weighed in on the presidency of Donald Trump during an interview with CBS News' Face the Nation on Dec. 25, 2016. (Reuters)\n\nAbsent another survey of late-night audiences, it is unclear what exactly has reversed Colbert's fortunes. Are liberal viewers tuning in in greater numbers? Or is Colbert bringing in conservatives who were uncomfortable with Trump during the campaign and who feel unnerved by his fledgling administration?\n\nIt is worth noting that Colbert's skewering of Miller on Monday night had little to do with liberal or conservative policy ideas; it was about a claim to unchecked power, which could alarm anybody.\n\nWe'll see whether Colbert can sustain his recent success. But if he was waiting for ratings to catch up to his vision for the \"Late Show,\" his patience is being rewarded, for now."}

It's a mark of the people skills of President Bill Clinton that it took his visit to unite the people of Northern Ireland, no matter how briefly, in their tens of thousands on the streets of Belfast and Londonderry.\n\nWe came here knowing that words are not very good at a time like this, simply to express our sympathy and to support your determined refusal to let a cowardly crime rob you of the future\n\nPresident Clinton at Omagh, 1998 President Bill Clinton's domestic legacy, belittled by opponents and tainted by impeachment, will be picked over for years to come. But few doubt the importance of the role that he played in helping to get Northern Ireland's divided community to sit down together with the common goal of consigning violence and inequality to the past. President Clinton is now on his third visit to Dublin and Belfast - three visits more than any other serving US President has ever undertaken. It's a commitment that has ranged from granting Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams a US visa in the belief that it would further peace, to admitting to being left \"overwhelmed\" following a meeting with victims of the Omagh bomb. Although the peace process is by no means complete, the White House has regarded it as little short of a Clinton foreign policy triumph. Origins of involvement For years, any White House desire to get involved in Northern Ireland was tempered by the relationship with London. Clinton timeline 1992: Irish Forum pledges 1994: Gerry Adams Visa 1994: George Mitchell Appointed 1995: First visit 1998: Key role in Good Friday Agreement 1998: Second visit 2000: Farewell visit During his White House campaign in 1992, the then Governor Clinton of Arkansas made a pledge to send a peace envoy, something that the majority of the politically influential Irish-American caucus had long sought. The commitment risked infuriating London and following election, Clinton appeared to have dropped the pledge - appointing only an \"economic envoy\", Senator George Mitchell. Coupled with the new US ambassador to Dublin, Jean Kennedy Smith, sister of Clinton's hero President John F Kennedy, the two appointments began a process that would see the US strengthen its involvement in the emerging peace process. Treading a fine line Clinton's approach to Northern Ireland appeared to mirror that of many of his domestic policies - appeal to all sides and seek consensus. His second policy plank was to encourage US companies to bring much-needed economic investment to Northern Ireland. But it was a fine line to follow. In 1994, President Clinton angered London, the US's closest ally, by granting a US visa to Gerry Adams. Despite accusations of being soft on terrorism and opposition among some of his own people, Clinton saw it another way. Only by including the republicans could they be encouraged to leave violence behind. First visit President Clinton's first visit to Northern Ireland came in November 1995, 15 months after the IRA announced its first cease-fire.\n\nHe was greeted by tens of thousands of people lining the streets. After famously shaking hands with Gerry Adams on Belfast's Falls Road (the exact location now features in the official Belfast bus tour), he went on to receive a rapturous reception when he turned on the Christmas tree lights in Belfast city centre. Clinton appeared to fire the imagination of many people in Northern Ireland, appearing both statesmanlike, non-partisan and folksy at the same time. The Adams handshake may have drawn unionist criticism, but the president treated him no differently to the political representatives of the loyalist paramilitaries - he would back those he saw as leaving violence behind. From talks to agreement George Mitchell's subsequent appointment as the honest broker between all sides in the developing talks, the de facto peace envoy Clinton had promised in 1992, is regarded by many as the president's single most important foreign policy decision of his administration.\n\nIt not only provided a respected and impartial figure to chair talks, but it effectively guaranteed the White House's involvement in helping to find a political settlement in Northern Ireland, between the north and the south and Dublin and London. Throughout the 1998 talks, there were frequent telephone calls from the Oval Office to the main players - culminating in a round of late-night contacts in the days leading up to the deadline. Mr Clinton never saw his role as a guarantor of a deal - but it was certainly his intention to be an enabler, encouraging compromise and exerting pressure at the same time. Mr Clinton's second visit to Northern Ireland, following the dissident republican bombing of Omagh, came as the president was facing increasing domestic pressures at home. He appeared visibly moved following a meeting with some of those who survived the bombing - but stressed to all of Northern Ireland that it was \"up to you\" to find the solutions. Difficult, sometimes wrenching decisions lie ahead but they must be made,\" he said. \"The spirit of reconciliation must be rooted in all you do.\" The future A question mark now hangs over future American policy.

{"id": 77, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Ten years ago a visionary named Vinod Khosla gave a presentation called Biofuels: Think Outside the Barrel. It seems to have disappeared from his Khosla Ventures website, but you can find an archived version here. In that presentation Mr. Khosla outlined his vision for biofuels. He projected that ethanol produced from biomass \u2013 aka \"cellulosic ethanol\" \u2013 would scale up rapidly. From zero commercial production in 2006, Khosla foresaw the first 100 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol hitting the market in 2008 (see Slide 78), ramping rapidly to 2.5 billion gallons in 2011, 14.6 billion gallons in 2015, and ultimately 173 billion gallons per year by 2030. Combined with corn ethanol production, he believed cellulosic ethanol could totally end U.S. dependence on petroleum for transportation fuel \u2013 but he needed to get the government on board to foot some costs.\n\nKhosla addressed potential obstacles in his presentation. Certainly cellulosic ethanol wouldn't fail because of technology. There were too many companies working on it. The magic of Moore's Law and black swans would be the ticket to success. (As an aside, he doesn't seem to understand the black swan theory, as he frequently cites these \"high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events\" as an expected outcome). The only real barrier he could identify was those despicable oil companies, who had to be shaking in their boots that this 100-year old upstart technology would spell their demise.\n\nBut he would deal with the oil companies through legislation by forcing them to purchase this product that had yet to be commercialized. So he lobbied, and he testified before Congress. He lost a vote or two, but he was instrumental in getting cellulosic ethanol mandates included in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The EPA was charged with implementing the RFS, and they based the mandated volumes on the amount that potential cellulosic ethanol producers claimed they would be able to produce. For 2010 the EPA was counting on 100 million gallons of cellulosic fuels based on claims primarily from two companies associated with Vinod Khosla: Range Fuels and Cello Energy.\n\nThis is ground that has been amply covered here before. Range Fuels and Cello Energy both went out of business after spending hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 including taxpayer money \u2014 without delivering a drop of cellulosic fuel. In fact there were zero gallons of qualifying cellulosic ethanol production for 2010 and 2011. In 2012 the first qualifying batch of cellulosic ethanol was produced \u2014 20,069 gallons by Blue Sugars Corporation. The ethanol was produced in April 2012, but that was it for the year. And Blue Sugars went out of business.\n\nThere was no qualifying cellulosic ethanol produced in 2013, the year Vinod Khosla had projected 7.2 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol production. But 2014 finally saw some qualifying production as several new plants came online.\n\nINEOS Bio and its joint venture partner New Planet Energy had announced the opening of the Indian River County BioEnergy Center in Florida in 2012. The nameplate capacity of this plant was 8 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol per year. The House Committee on Agriculture was told in 2012 \"The biorefinery is a major landmark for this country. It's the first commercial cellulosic refinery.\" But the EPA doesn't show any production from anyone in 2012 or 2013, and in December 2013 the company issued a press release that said in part: \"Bringing the facility on-line and up to capacity has taken longer than planned due to several unexpected start-up issues at the Center. These efforts have highlighted some needed modifications and upgrades.\" Another update from them in 2014 cast doubt that they would ever produce any ethanol.\n\nOn July 7, 2011 the U.S. Department of Energy had announced a $105 million loan guarantee to POET for the development of its 25 million gallon per year corn cob-to-ethanol facility, dubbed Project Liberty, at Emmetsberg, Iowa. POET, one of the largest producers of ethanol in the world announced that they were open for commercial cellulosic ethanol production in September 2014. Cellulosic ethanol production had been slated to begin in May 2013, but more than a year later than projected Jeff Broin, POET Founder and Executive Chairman, stated \"Some have called cellulosic ethanol a 'fantasy fuel,' but today it becomes a reality.\"\n\nAnother company, Abengoa (NASDAQ: ABGB) built a $500 million cellulosic ethanol plant in Hugoton, Kansas. In October 2014 they announced the grand opening of the facility: \"Abengoa's new industry-leading biorefinery finished construction in mid-August and began producing cellulosic ethanol at the end of September with the capacity to produce up to 25 million gallons per year.\"\n"}

I'm hormonal and can't think clearly and am honestly furious and scared that our marriage is going to fall apart. The abuse happened two years ago which is why I'm posting here but the problem is happening now. We've been married since Valentine's Day 2014.\n\nIn 2015, my husband Manuel finished his Navy reserves enlistment. He has a very high paying career and about a week after being discharged, he went to his friend's party. Basically at the party, a woman named Emma started talking to him, drugged his drink, and took advantage of him. My husband found out the day after because a friend told him he found him unconscious and saw earlier Emma on top of him on the bed but didn't realize it was him until later. Manuel didn't report her because he didn't want to \"ruin her life\" and so the law never got involved. My husband told me what happened the day after the party and I had a mental breakdown and went to therapy because I was going to legitimately kill her. To make it worse, she got pregnant from the incident. I don't have violent thoughts anymore but at the time I was so angry that I wanted to kill her and it got worse once I found out she got pregnant from that. I felt so bad for Manuel and he was disappointed at how he was taken advantage of but it didn't seem to affect him that much. I don't know if it was because he didn't want to show emotion or if it really didn't affect him.\n\nHe helps her out willingly and pays for some of her expenses and their baby's expenses. She's a pharmacy technician but since rent in our state and city is pretty high, he helps her out. He went to her delivery and even though he's extremely busy with work and our time, she drops their baby off at our apartment a lot of times in the evening since I don't allow my husband to be alone with her at all or go to her apartment and so my husband can spend time with him. I have met her but we have spoken maybe 40 words total and we're extremely cold and distant. The only reason I'm even letting this happen is because it's not the baby's fault and I don't want Manuel to not see his baby.\n\nOn Saturday, Emma came to our apartment and wanted to talk to my husband. They sat down, she wanted me to leave the room to talk in private but I told her no right off the bat because I don't trust her. She legitimately told him that he needed to \"step up\" and \"be a more active father\" and \"be there for our baby\". She works full time and her parents help out with the babysitting .\n\nShe wants their baby to spend more time with both of them together instead of just her \"dropping him off like a package\" and not having the baby bond with both parents at the same time. She said that Manuel also needed to be available more often since she wants Manuel to be around the baby and she wants to drop the baby off more times a week (right now it's around 2-4 times per week...the baby sometimes spends the night but mostly she comes picks him up after a few hours). She needs money for a car since her car is breaking down and she \"doesn't want any problems with dropping the baby off or endangering the baby\". This sounds like a load of shit to me but I want opinions. She wants Manuel to make trips to her apartment and visit the baby because sometimes she can't make the trip. In my opinion, if worse comes to worse, I'll drive and pick up the baby but I'm starting to think she might want to take advantage of him again since she desperately wants him to go to her apartment to visit their baby.\n\nShe acts so shameless and her attitude was so bitchy. She was acting like Manuel was \"slacking\" or neglecting his duties like they were married or something. The part where she wanted me to leave the room made me extremely suspicious and I'm wondering if maybe she wants to tell him something else but didn't because I was there. I'm pregnant and when the baby comes and we have more, I obviously expect Manuel to prioritize his real children and not her or her baby.\n\nShe left after a while and honestly she comes off as flirty sometimes but I don't mind since they barely see each other and he'd never do anything with her. He's very nice to her but keeps his distance with her like I want him to.\n\nI told him that absolutely not is he going to buy her a new car. He started telling me that he's going to pay for a safe and good car for her. She has money and she isn't poor. Manuel is saying that he doesn't want his baby to have a low quality car"}

His two biggest parts were as patriarch James Evans Sr. on Good Times and as the elder Kunta Kinte on Roots. But he first won fame with a smaller, yet still enduring, part: Gordy the weatherman on CBS's The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Amos appeared roughly a dozen times over the course of the show's first three seasons, and even though he left to take a regular gig on Good Times in 1974, his character was vital enough that he returned with his own spotlight episode during the final season of Mary Tyler Moore. Tonight Amos can be seen talking about his experiences on the show, alongside Betty White, Valerie Harper, Ed Asner, Dick Van Dyke, and others, as part of Mary Tyler Moore: A Celebration, airing at 8 p.m. on most PBS stations. Vulture caught up with Amos by phone last week to dive deeper into his MTM days, including how the show gave him his big break as an actor and the time producers had to retaliate against a racist crew member. He also talked to us about his bumpy ride on Good Times and gave us his thoughts about next year's planned update of Roots.\n\nIt's great to speak to you, Mr. Amos. You're on the East Coast now, right? How are you?\n\nI'm in Jersey. I'm fine!\n\nI want to talk to you first about The Mary Tyler Moore Show, since you're part of this new PBS tribute to Ms. Moore. Your role on MTM was sort of your first big national exposure as an actor, though you'd worked as a writer for Leslie Uggams's CBS variety show back in 1969. I read an interview with you where you talked about how you had wanted to break into performing on her show, but the producers said you couldn't do both. Why was that?\n\nBack then you were lucky to be in the business in any working capacity. The idea that I would be in there as a writer, and then want to perform, too? That was just an abstract concept to the producers at that time. They weren't ready for somebody who thought they could act and write. I had to wait until my turn came.\n\nWhen you say they weren't ready, was it because you were young, or because you were African-American?\n\nI think it was a bit of both. I was just getting started, and that was my first network writing job. Although I had written comedy and performed on a local television show, Lohman & Barkley, which won an Emmy. In fact, we all wrote and performed, the \"we\" being the entire writing staff, which consisted of Craig T. Nelson, Barry Levinson, the late McLean Stevenson, amongst others. We were all just getting started, and that was wonderful training for us. Having written and performed on a local show that did successfully, I had every reason to believe I could do that at the network level. But they said, \"No, you can only do one.\"\n\nSo how did you ultimately make the jump to performing, and to MTM?\n\nOne day I had lunch with two of the writers on the [Uggams] show, Lorenzo Music and Dave Davis. And they said, \"John, when you act out these sketches for our guest artists, we think you've got the chops. We're involved in the development of something called The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and we think you'd be right for one of the characters.\" I just took it with a grain of salt. It sounded too good to be true. But later they stayed true to their word. When The Mary Tyler Moore Show [was picked up to series], they called me.\n\nDid you have to try out for the gig?\n\nI auditioned for Mary, Grant Tinker, and the powers that be, and got the job as Gordy the weatherman. It became a recurring character.\n\nBecause of The Dick Van Dyke Show, Ms. Moore was already a TV icon of sorts even before she got her own series. What was your experience working with her?\n\nThe joy of working with Mary was, you knew who the star of the show was. It was The Mary Tyler Moore Show. So there were no attempts to upstage her, or any of the other things that usually go with actors surrounding the star. It was a harmonious set. She and Phyllis and Valerie got along great, because all they would talk about, all day long, was diets and health food. [Laughs.] As soon as they got to the set, the conversation would start. So they had a nice little [group] going. And they all got along great. It was a wonderful atmosphere. I felt, for the first time, that I was part of a real, meaningful ensemble.

He knows where his fastball's going,\" Maddon said.\n\nMets manager Terry Collins just pointed to the total package.\n\n\"His location has just been off the charts,\" Collins said. \"He's got this, he may call it a slider, it's this hard cutter that he's now started to command that he's eating up left-handed hitters. He locates the fastball. He moves his curveball around.\"\n\nArrieta threw a career high 229 innings, but Maddon noted how much of his work was low stress because he only averaged 15-plus pitches an inning. Arrieta claimed the mental was harder than the physical.\n\n\"The mental expenditure of energy,\" Arrieta assessed. \"Throughout the course of the day you start to contemplate your routine and think about the game in different scenarios \u2026 that heart rate starts to rise a little bit.\"\n\nThink of the guys facing him.\n\n\"The physical toll really hasn't bothered me at all,\" he said, \"but the mental side of it and all the energy you burn leading up to the game does have a little bit of effect.\""}

The car is very sentimental to me and Tri-Point has been amazing. They've taken meticulous care in their repairs. I've been driving the car to work and loving it. Thank you, Tri-Point Engineering\n\nTook my 09 Mazdaspeed 3 in to get serviced by these self proclaimed Mazda specialist, what I ended up receiving is ham-fisted, half-ass work, with 0 accountability resulting in me needing to pay another shop to fix mistakes. Services I paid for that were performed improperly: - Replaced gas cap to try and resolve Vacuum code After I took the car to get er filled up, I noticed that the gas cap that they replaced my OEM one with did not spin properly with the rubber-gasket-string that attaches it to the exterior door. Basically, you'd turn it tight and it'd rip out the rubber-gasket-string from the gas door. Obviously an inadequate gas cap was ordered as it did not fit with the factory equipment. But the worse offense was that they installed it, and I'm assuming tested it, and found it's improper fitment as passable. This is just a microcosm of the lack of attention to detail, and or pride in the work they do. I immediately took it back and they ended up shaving the rubber gasket down so it'd spin with the gas cap. I'm still experiencing the vacuum leak so this was also a misdiagnosis. -Motor-mount replacement Paid $500 to have my engine motor mount replaced (was experiencing no issues at the time but took their word for it). Well, 9k miles later, I started to hear creeks, and clacks coming from the engine bay. Turns out the motor mount they replaced was totally shot. Ended up paying $600 to have them all replaced to resolve the issue. -Replaced spark plugs Immediately after the performed the work my car would no longer start in cold weather. They insisted it had nothing to do with the work they performed but the problem only started happening after the work they performed. Well, 9k miles later, I started experiencing really rough idle. I looked on the forums and a common cause is spark plugs not being gapped properly. I took them out myself, re-gapped them to .029, and now the problem is gone. A couple were off by quite a few centimeters. What kind of shop can't gap their spark plugs properly? Other notes: It was really difficult getting ahold of them during the whole time they had my car. They don't work weekends and during the week when I'd call them I'd never get a call back for days at a time. I tried emailing them but even that it'd take forever to receive a message back.\n\nThe real-deal Tri-Point is long gone. Do yourself a favor and avoid these imposters. The real Tri-Point worked on my ancient Mazda 626 and later my 1991 RX-7 GTUs. That shop is long gone. Marc Shuler and Craig Nagler (the REAL owners) were certified card carrying Mazda experts. The current owners aren't really even up to the challenge of operating. Their location looks like a wrecking yard and they rarely answer the phone. Still, I took a chance and made an \"appointment\" with them for an oil change. I showed up at the shop at the designated time but no one was there. To be honest, it looked they were out of business and left a bunch of partially repaired cars in their wake. I walked around and finally the guy in the shop next door called over to me and said, \"He's not here.\" Uh, right; \"he\" is most obviously not here... So, I stood around for a while and then headed for home. I figured that a few minutes later I'd get a call from them explaining what was going on. Nope. Silence. After I got home I decided to call them just to follow-up and to thank them for wasting 45 minutes of my day. The guy I talked to sounded like he had just woken up. When I told him about my appointment and the fact he weren't there he said, \"Well, you don't need an appointment for an oil change.\" Amazingly clueless. I wouldn't trust these guys to change my windshield wiper blades. They do not deserve to be doing business under the name Tri-Point Engineering. Avoid them at all costs.\n\nThis is my 1990' Mazda Miata the car is one of lifes joys an who better to take care of most precious possesions in life but the very guys who do what they love as a living!

A 2007 Pentagon memo that the New York Times quoted in a 2010 article says that Afghanistan could be the \"Saudi Arabia of lithium.\"\n\nU.S. Companies are planning on taking a larger role in extracting Afghanistan's enormous reserves of valuable rare earth minerals, Reuters reported after U.S. President Donald Trump met with his Afghan counterpart Ashraf Ghani on Thursday.\n\nAccording to a White House statement, the presidents agreed that the development of Afghan minerals by U.S. companies would \"develop materials critical to national security,\" as well as \"defray some of the costs of United States assistance as Afghans become more self-reliant.\"\n\nAfghanistan has some of the world's largest un-extracted reserves of rare earth minerals valuable in electronic production, such as lithium, as well as gold and various gemstones. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the total value at at least US$1 trillion.\n\nThe two presidents reportedly discussed difficulties facing the project, such as the growing Taliban insurgency in regions containing the majority of the minerals. With this in account, they both expressed commitment to Trump's new Afghanistan strategy, which, against what he promised in the election campaign, involves keeping U.S. military forces in the country for an indefinite period of time.\n\nThe U.S. military has had its eyes on Afghan mineral deposits for some time. A 2007 Pentagon memo that the New York Times quoted in a 2010 article says that Afghanistan could be the \"Saudi Arabia of lithium,\" referencing the oil-rich monarchy that is a key U.S. regional ally.\n\n\"There is stunning potential here (in Afghanistan),\" General David Petraeus said in the same memo.\n\nSome analysts also believe that a push for greater U.S. presence in Afghan mineral extraction could be a way of limiting the influence of China. With China, along with Russia and Iran gaining greater regional influence, economic activities in the region are no longer the sole domain of U.S.-based companies.\n\nChina and Afghanistan have already cooperated to an extent in mineral extraction and China has made the country a center-point of its planned Belt and Road initiative, which seeks to commercially link Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and more recently Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nAfghanistan also has extensive oil reserves, with a new oil field having been discovered as recently as 2010.\n\nWritten by TeleSUR\n\nEditor's Note: This natural resource extraction was one of the original ambitions of those who disingenuously led the US to war in Afghanistan under the guise of fighting a \"war on terror,\" that better resembles a war OF terror, much like has been seen in any country the US \"liberates.\" And in classically contradictory deep state fashion, this is being framed ironically as a way to 'defray cost of assistance.' So after Afghanistan is left in ruin, with more \"terrorist\" presence than to begin with, otherwise known as US \"assistance,\" the US is now going to begin mining (more of) the country's natural resources, in exchange for that \"assistance.\" Long ago, this country was usurped by individuals who now deceptively carry out this type of atrocity in your name, while invoking and stoking your blind patriotism at every turn.

Just over 1 in 4 (27%) have an unfavorable view of Biden.\n\nWhat's remarkable about those numbers is how Biden's favorability has surged since he (and Obama) left office. As recently as March 2015, CNN polling showed more people viewed Biden unfavorably (46%) than regarded him favorably (43%).\n\nThe recovery of Biden's numbers stands in stark contrast to the ongoing negative view that Americans hold of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's 2016 presidential nominee; in Gallup polling released earlier this week, Clinton's favorable rating dipped to 36%\n\nWhat explains Biden's current popularity? A few things:\n\nHe drew hugely laudatory coverage earlier this year for his book tour in support of his memoir about the loss of his eldest son, Beau.\n\nPoliticians -- with the notable exception of Clinton (of late) -- always grow more popular when out of office.\n\nSome level of buyer's remorse -- particularly among Democrats -- who believe that had Biden run in 2016, he would have easily beaten Donald Trump.\n\nBiden has been open about his thinking on running for president in 2020, which would be his third bid for the nation's highest office. \"If I were offered the nomination by the Lord Almighty right now, today, I would say no because we're not ready, the family's not ready to do this,\" Biden said on \"The View\" earlier this month. \"If, in a year from now, if we're ready, and nobody has moved in that I think can do it, then I may very well do it.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Biden won't deny a 2020 run for president Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden won't deny a 2020 run for president 01:21\n\nWhile Biden has made no decisions, he's doing the sorts of things someone running for president does in these early stages. He has apologized for his less-than-robust defense of Anita Hill during Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court confirmation hearing in 1991. He has traveled the country in support of Democratic candidates. And so on.\n\nWhat's so interesting about the CNN poll is that it not only shows why Biden is clearly a top-tier candidate if he runs for president but it also reveals his potential Achilles' heel in that race.\n\nWhen asked whether \"the country would be governed better or governed worse if more women were in political office,\" almost two-thirds of Americans (64%) said the country would be better off with more women in office. Just 10% said things would be worse with more women in elected office, while 16% said it wouldn't make much difference.\n\nWhy is that relevant to Biden? Because he is a 75-year-old white man considering a run for president amid the #metoo movement and a cultural awakening about the boorish -- and in some cases criminal -- behavior by men toward women in the workplace.\n\nThat a large majority of people believe the country would be better off with more women running things suggests a major opening exists for a female politician to make a very credible run for the Democratic nomination in 2020.\n\nAt the moment, none of the female candidates who might run are even close to as well known as Biden. One example: More than half of the country -- 55% -- didn't know enough about New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand to offer an opinion about her in the new CNN poll\n\nBut, it's 2017. Which means Gillibrand, who has become a leading voice of the #metoo movement in Congress, has plenty of time to get better known and to challenge the likes of Biden for the nomination.\n\nThat is a worry for another day for Biden and his allies, however. Today they will revel in his popularity and use those positive numbers to build buzz for a 2020 bid."}

Why do US presidents \u2013 and presidential aspirants \u2013 release their tax returns to the press?\n\nYes, we know it's a sunshine thing. It's supposed to prove they're paying their fair share. But why taxes, specifically? Is the publication of presidential financial data, like so many Washington political rituals, the result of some particular scandal?\n\nWhy yes it is, and thanks for asking! It lets us open the gift to journalists and historians that is the life of Richard M. Nixon.\n\nHis 1974 resignation over Watergate makes it easy today to forget that by late 1973, President Nixon was in big trouble over how little he was paying in federal taxes.\n\nHe himself first steered attention to his taxes by boasting at a September press conference that he'd been audited by the IRS and found clean. Reporters started digging and, long story short, he had paid Uncle Sam less than $6,000 on an aggregate income of $790,000 from 1970 through 1972.\n\nHe'd taken big deductions for donating his vice-presidential papers to charity and for interest on the mortgage for his San Clemente house, among other things. The public was outraged.\n\n\"Nixon's taxes were an issue that average citizens readily understood as compared to the constitutional issues raised by the Watergate investigation,\" concluded University of Alabama tax professor William Samson, in a 2005 analysis of the returns.\n\nUpon further consideration, the IRS decided that Nixon owed $465,000 in back taxes, which he paid. This penalty cut Nixon's personal wealth in half.\n\nAfter Nixon's resignation, President Gerald Ford faced the task of restoring citizens' faith in government. The US tax system is largely voluntary, after all. Few taxpayers are audited. If voters think the person at the top is cheating, they will, too.\n\nSo in April 1976, at the start of his own reelection campaign, Mr. Ford publicly released his 1975 return. He'd paid $94,569 in taxes on an income of $204,606. After he was elected, Jimmy Carter followed suit, and so has every president since, as well as numerous vice presidents and other top US politicians.\n\nTax Day 2011:\n\nPart 1: When is the tax deadline?

And soon, they could be able to add unmanned drones to that list.\n\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina (ACLU-NC) uncovered a wealth of information about surveillance technologies that police and sheriff's departments use in jurisdictions across the state, through a series of public records requests. Thursday morning, ACLU-NC policy director Sarah Preston and staff attorney Nathan Wessler joined former state Senator and criminal defense attorney Thom Goolsby to host a legislative briefing on privacy and surveillance issues.\n\n\nWhile surveillance technology is not new, its use by law enforcement is becoming more widespread in the digital age, and the laws regulating its use have fallen far behind. The federal statute that governs warrantless access to cell phone and email records, for example, has not been updated since 1986. Now, regulating surveillance technology is falling to the states, and the ACLU-NC is pushing for legislation that protects the Fourth Amendment, by requiring law enforcement to obtain a warrant before collecting certain kinds of digital information on citizens.\n\n\n\"Bills that have been introduced in the past have had bi-partisan support,\" Preston said. \"This is a great issue to bring forward right now to build common ground (between parties). We are really hopeful that we will see legislators move forward and we're thankful that they are taking an interest in this.\"\n\n\nLaw enforcement agencies can track locations electronically in two ways.\n\n\nFirst, they can request historical data from a cell phone service provider, as providers log the sector of the specific cell phone tower that transmitted every phone call made and received, every text message sent and received and every time a phone is used to access data such as email or social media sites. With more and more people using smart phones, more cell phone towers are being built closer together, making law enforcement's ability to locate someone GPS-level precise.\n\n\nThough this practice is widespread\u2014the ACL-NCU found that in 2014, AT&T received 30 thousand data requests from law enforcement, and that the numbers of requests are increasing monthly\u2014it could easily be regulated by requiring police to obtain a warrant before receiving the data.\n\n\nPolice can also use their own technology to track location with the purchase of Cell Site Simulators, or Stingrays, from private manufacturers. Stingrays mimic cell phone towers by sending out signals which trick every cell phone in the vicinity into reporting its unique serial number and other data. A cell phone user would have no way to tell if police were tracking their phone.\n\n\nStingray use is shrouded in secrecy\u2014the Associated Press reports that the Obama administration instructed police departments not to disclose their use of Stingrays\u2014 so it is unclear how much data law enforcement agencies obtain with these devices. But Stingrays can pinpoint an individual cell phone's location down to a room in a building and law enforcement can track cell phone transmissions and record their locations over time. Regulating these devices will go beyond just having to obtain a warrant, as they gather data from not just one individual cell phone, but from all the cell phones in the vicinity.\n\n\n\"It's vital to address both historical and real time records,\" said ACLU-NC staff attorney Wessler. \"Historical records give police a power that in our entire history they have never had before, essentially a time machine that lets police go back in time and see where you have been in the course of days and weeks and months.\"\n\n\nAutomatic License Plate Readers (ALPR's)\u2014cameras mounted on stoplights, buildings, police cruisers\u2014can capture thousands of license plates per minute, scan them for red flags and store the time-stamped images indefinitely. While ALPR's have many non-controversial uses, like matching tags to stolen vehicles or capturing traffic violations, their widespread use and the data they store could allow government agencies to map out a person's location and movements over time, an invasion of privacy.\n\n\nIn North Carolina, the ACLU-NC found that 11 jurisdictions use ALPR's without any state regulation, and some agencies store the information for years, regardless of whether there is any suspicion of a crime. Simply requiring the images to be deleted after a period of ten days could be an effective way to regulate these devices.\n\n\nUnmanned aircraft, or drones, could present a significant new avenue for government surveillance, according to the ACLU-NC. Law enforcement agencies across the country, including in North Carolina, have expressed interest in testing drones, and at least two jurisdictions in the state have purchased drones with surveillance equipment using drug forfeiture funds. The 2014 budget included HB 1066, a bill that ostensibly sought to regulate the use of drones by government agencies but that contained a long list of exceptions that allowed their use without a warrant.\n\n\nThe ACLU-NC is lobbying to amend state law to limit the use of drones \"to instances where there are specific and artic"}

The SEC charges were filed against Buca, Inc.'s former CEO, Joseph Micatrotto, the company's former CFO, Greg Gadel, and its former Controller, Daniel J. Skrypek.\n\nBuca is a Minneapolis, Minn., company that operates the Buca di Beppo and Vinny T's of Boston national restaurant chains.\n\n\"Buca's top officers created a tone at the top and a corporate culture that allowed them to loot the company and engage in a financial fraud,\" stated Linda Thomsen, the SEC's Director of Enforcement. \"Such conduct is a fundamental violation of the trust placed in corporate officers by public shareholders and cannot be countenanced.\"\n\n\"The fraud that pervaded the executive suite at Buca existed because the company's top officers showed scant regard for sound corporate governance,\" said Merri Jo Gillette, Director of the Commission's Midwest Regional Office. \"The sanctions obtained against Buca's former CEO, Mr. Micatrotto, demonstrate that the Commission will deal with such conduct in the strongest terms.\"\n\nMicatrotto has agreed to settle the Commission's action, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, by consenting to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of $65,000 plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty of $500,000 and a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company. In setting the disgorgement amount, the Commission took into account Micatrotto's previous payments to Buca in connection with his undisclosed compensation and his transfer of title of an Italian villa to Buca.\n\nThe Commission's complaint alleges that, from 2000 to 2003, Micatrotto obtained undisclosed compensation in the amount of $849,100 by improperly billing Buca for a wide variety of personal and non-business expenses. In a separate action, filed against Buca's former CFO, Greg A. Gadel, and former Controller, Daniel J. Skrypek, the Commission alleges that Gadel and Skrypek approved many of Micatrotto's inappropriate reimbursement requests.\n\nThe complaint against Micatrotto alleges that Buca \"reimbursed\" the former CEO for, among other things, $131,000 in cash withdrawals from ATMs; a total of $127,000 for the same airline tickets submitted for reimbursement multiple times; the entire bill for the groom's dinner at his son's wedding; and other personal expenses, including dog kenneling and the remodeling of his homes in California, Las Vegas and Minneapolis. However, since these payments were not made to reimburse legitimate business expenses, they constituted additional compensation to Micatrotto and should have been reflected as such on Buca's books. They were not. As a result, Buca's proxy statements for this time period understated Micatrotto's annual compensation by amounts ranging from 27% to 74%.\n\nThe Commission's complaint further alleges that Micatrotto engaged in two undisclosed related-party transactions. First, in 2001 Micatrotto used Buca funds to purchase an Italian villa in the name of himself and his wife, and then arranged for Buca to pay for certain improvements to the villa. Second, in June 2003 Micatrotto personally received $65,000 from one of Buca's vendors. The complaint charges Micatrotto with violating, and aiding and abetting violations of, the antifraud, proxy, reporting, internal controls and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws.\n\nIn its separate action against Buca's former CFO, Gadel, and former Controller, Skrypek, the Commission alleges that Gadel, from 2000 to 2003, received approximately $96,630 in undisclosed compensation, including reimbursements that he obtained from Buca for family vacations and visits to strip clubs. The complaint further alleges that Gadel knew of a series of undisclosed related party transactions totaling more than $1 million between Buca and an information technology company of which Gadel was a director and shareholder. Finally, the Commission's complaint alleges that Gadel and Skrypek directed a financial fraud in which Buca inflated its income by nearly $12 million from 2000 to 2004 through the improper capitalization of numerous expenses. The financial fraud caused Buca to overstate its annual income in amounts ranging from 18.8% to 36.9%. The Commission's complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota"}

It works by laying dormant on your Mac until you visit the Hidden website and mark your computer as stolen, this then activates the tracking software. Once activated, Hidden starts gathering a slew of information on your missing Mac, including location plotted on Google Maps (see screenshot above), photos of the thief via the built-in iSight camera, screenshots of your Mac in use and what the thief is doing, IP addresses, and more.\n\nAfter you can install the app, you can test out its efficacy yourself by using 'Test Mode' through their web control panel, this will give you an idea of the data collected and how the app works. Hidden reportedly works across the globe, so whether you're in San Francisco or Budapest you'll be able to get use out of the app.\n\nTo get the most out of Hidden, the developers recommend setting up and enabling a separate password free Guest account. While this is contrary to the usual Mac security recommendations, it makes sense here, because with Hidden running you actually want the thief to be using the computer so that you can gather information about them. With all this data captured, you can turn it over to local authorities to pursue the thief.\n\nNow here's the best part, Hidden is free to download and install until January, after which the price is a low $20.\n\nUpdate: Apparently Hidden is no longer free, the developer was swarmed with requests and had to cancel the offer.

(Guardian Masternode AMA)\n\nAnyone with 5000+ Walton tokens in their wallet before 7:00 PM EST on Saturday, December 9 can run a Guardian Masternode. (Countdown timer)\n\ncan run a Guardian Masternode. (Countdown timer) No additional Guardian Masternodes will ever be created after this deadline.\n\nGuardian Masternodes will receive higher mining rewards than standard masternodes.\n\nWATCHING THE BINANCE WALLET\n\nMr. Laserman's Helpful Analysis\n\nOn November 30, Mr. L posted his article \"Guardian Masternode token lockup,\" showing why the introduction of Guardian Masternodes would cause a rapid reduction in the number of tokens available for purchase, and thereforce likely cause a price increase.\n\nBecause Binance is the only major exchange that currently trades Walton, Mr. Lasermen pointed out that Binance represents \"96% of all tokens kept on exchanges,\" and showed the effect that the announcement had already on Binance's supply of Walton tokens:\n\nNovember 27th: One hour before the Guardian Masternode was announced, Binance had 3,760,193 WTC (15% of the circulating supply) in its wallet.\n\nNovember 30th: Binance had only 2,013,874 WTC (8% of the circulating supply) in its wallet.\n\n44% of all liquid tradable WTC have been removed from the marketplace in 3 days.\n\nMr. L then speculated that if 50% of Binance's remaining Walton tokens were withdrawn during the run-up to the Guardian deadline, that would leave only 1 million tokens for sale on Binance, or about 4% of the circulating supply.\n\nThis drastic reduction in available supply would then affect the price accordingly:\n\nIf demand remains constant, I would expect a 200\u2013300% increase in price over the next 30 days as the market tries to find a new equilibrium. This would translate to a price in the range of $10.34 to $15.51.\n\nIf demand increases, I would expect a 400% increase in price at a minimum. The upper bounds are impossible to predict if a FOMO event takes place. However, 1000% is entirely possible in that scenario. This would translate to a price in the range from $20.68 to $51.70.\n\nHow Things Have Played Out Since Then\n\nAs it turns out, despite his great insights, Mr. L drastically underestimated the rate at which Walton would be withdrawn from Binance.\n\nOn November 30, around 5:30 pm EST, he speculated that perhaps about 1 million WTC would be withdrawn over the next 10 days leading up to the deadline.\n\nIn fact, 1 million WTC had already been withdrawn from Binance by 8:30 pm the next day, just 27 hours later.\n\nPlot Twist\n\nBut what Mr. Laserman didn't count on was that Binance was going to \"re-up\" their Walton wallet, using customer deposits from other wallet addresses.\n\nOn December 1 at 5:00 am, Binance added another 1.2 million in WTC to their wallet address, bringing the balance up to 2.6 million.\n\nAnd again, on December 2, Binance deposited an additional 1.1 million WTC to their wallet.\n\nOn this spreadsheet you can see all of deposits and withdrawals on Binance's wallet address for Walton.\n\nSTUDYING THE RE-UPS\n\nSo, what can we learn about Binance's token supply based on their patterns of refilling their Walton wallet?\n\nHere are the re-ups before the Guardian Node Announcement:\n\nAugust 25 \u2014 Wallet is created. First deposit batch adds 1.3 million WTC. September 4 \u2014 Wallet balance dwindles to 500k WTC. Binance adds 9 million WTC to the wallet. September 11\u2014Binance adds another 7.4 million to the wallet, bringing the wallet to it's highest balance so far, 14.1 million.\n\nAnd here are the re-ups since the Walton Guardian Node Announcement on November 27.\n\nDecember 1 \u2014 Binance deposits 1.2 million. Resulting balance = 2.6 million WTC December 2 \u2014 Binance deposits 1.1 million. Resulting balance = 2.8 million"}

(no more champs, no more skins, please fix bugs, please add new features, please add a purpose).\n\n\nWhat Hirez didn't realize is that the millions of players that already play Paladins, don't play this game because of its grinding (which does not exist); they play this game because of its unique strategy which combines a balanced diversity of different play-styles (champions) the player can choose from... either to support the overall strategy of his team (comp/pro scene) or to kill as many enemies as possible with that strategy and enjoy it(casual).\n\n\nNow because Hirez didn't realize that, they disturbed that so unique game balance, the balance between those completely different play-styles (champions), the diversity of equally strong yet extremely different styles that makes Paladins stand out of the crowd in the world of gaming!...\n\n\nThey allowed players with non-equal (up to 400% stronger) loadouts to face each other in every game mode of Paladins, except Competitive!\n\n\nNo! Balancing Competitive is not all that matters!\n\nCasual has always been a critical success factor for Paladins!\n\nMuch more people played Casual than Competitive...\n\nI agree that Competitive needs a boost to become a bit more popular but ruining the rest of the game modes isn't the way to go for it!\n\n\nIt is true that the Pro Scene have been advertised a lot lately and literally formed the meta, the trends, the play-styles for both Competitive and Casual.\n\nI don't say everyone used those play-styles (especially in low ELO) but the need to catch the opponents off-guard using new strategies in Pro Scene generated a lot of new strategie which kept the game alive and going!\n\n\nIt wasn't the new skins coming out that kept the game alive all this time, but the new strategies developed by the Pros and advertised by the YouTubers!\n\n\nThe disadvantage of this mechanism (although it worked pretty well) is that it only affects more experienced players who spend time to study and test these new strategies.\n\nThe newest players aren't affected directly and the only thing that keeps them playing is their curiosity to try out all the champions and make them work somehow... maybe try all the legendary as well.\n\nAfter that stage (around level 30-40, idk for sure) and before they enter the stage we mentioned above (where they can test the most of those advanced, team based strategies suggested by Pros) there is a gap where many players might find Paladins boring and give up on it.\n\n\nThere is where the new card system is useful!\n\nIt gives a purpose to those players; max out their cards to enjoy an over-powered experience in Casual (e.g. infinite roll cassie, infinite ammo vivian, super mobility maeve, godlike counter zhin, super tank inara, healing god mal'damba etc.)!\n\n\nThis is how the new casual should be advertised; a mode without pressure, where you can experience the ultimate versions of your champions and play around in a variety of maps and modes!\n\n\nThe ONLY way this dream can become reality is to make the process of maxing out cards relatively easy!\n\nEvery player that is experienced enough to ''spontaneously form a battle plan, play as a team and adjust his/her playstyle to according to the situation'' or else reach around level 80, should have the majority of his/her cards maxed out!\n\n\nWhile grinding might seem exciting for a new player, for an experienced player it will be frustrating and confusing.\n\n\nJumping from a fair battlefield (like Competitive) to an unfair battlefield (like Casual) will have the following circumstances:\n\nA) Confusion (like playing a whole different game).\n\nB) Need to adjust strategy based on the team's card levels (more thinking, less casualty).\n\nC) Limitation of viable strategies (due to low level cards).\n\nD) The player can't trust on his/her own skill and the instincts he/she has developed in Competitive.\n\n\nThe level at which an experienced player is playing, demands a fair battlefield even in Casual settings.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause even the smallest interaction counts.\n\nBecause the way that player use his/her game understanding to succeed is spontaneous and based on those interactions.\n\n\nThat's why the grinding should stop after a certain level and every match should be fair (even in casual).\n\n\nA quick calculation on how many cards"}

(For the record, Harris was apparently suggesting that this \"replacement\" of creation by curation was something he wanted to combat, not to celebrate.)\n\n\"Curation\" Is Still a Stupid Term\n\n\"Curation\" strikes a lot of people as a weird, inaccurate thing to call the selection/connection/display activities made possible by the internet. (I wrote a gigantic thing about that awhile back\u2014tl;dr is that we're stuck with the term, and that maybe we should work toward the traditional senses of curation by becoming better caretakers of the content we \"curate.\")\n\nIt's probably so difficult to find a word for the practice because it's quite difficult to isolate the underlying impulse from just\u2026being human. This stuff we do on Pinterest and Pinboard and Polyvore and (some) blogs is much less like \"editing\" or \"curating\" and much more like the casual forms of taste display that we participate in when we get dressed in the morning, create mix tapes, collect art, buy and arrange furniture, collect books or records, and banter with clerks in one of the world's three remaining video shops.\n\nThe hilarious thing about the \"know your place and respect your elders\" screeds\u2014there are many, and I'm not going to link to them\u2014besides the fact that they make those of us who write them sound ancient, is that they don't even read to the people doing the \"curation.\" Serial pinners aren't fighting for cultural credibility by using terms like \"curation.\" They just need a term. Popova herself doesn't like the word.\n\nIf I were more awesome, I'd go back in time and suggest an alternate word like \"blogger\" that is just palatable enough to come into mainstream use. But I'm stuck here like everyone else, so I'm going to just tell you that in my own house, and in conversations with my friends, I don't say \"curator\" without hand-flapping airquotes. I say \"bowerbird.\"\n\nBirds Not Blogs\n\nIf you haven't seen David Attenborough's glorious series The Life of Birds, you're missing out on something really wonderful. In one segment, he introduces the Australian bowerbird, which is notable for the extraordinary display of found materials it creates in order to seduce a mate.\n\nSo for now, I'm going to just say \"bowerbirds\" instead of \"content curators\" so that I can talk about the practice instead of the title. (I'm not suggesting that everyone switch to this term\u2014y'all can fight about the language somewhere else.)\n\nWhen taste-display happened only offline, it didn't really threaten anyone\u2014except the geniuses at the RIAA, who think mixtapes are deadly and would happily sneak charge you royalties on earworms if they possibly could.\n\nOnline, it's different. For one thing,"}

There's no word on which model of iPad is used, either, but we would expect it to be the latest and greatest model given the standard of the establishment.\n\nObviously the iPads aren't the end of the luxury at the Burj Al Arab. Walk-in showers and Jacuzzis, huge plasma TVs, Rolls-Royce and a private butler service are all part of the package during your stay, though having never been to somewhere like this ourselves, that may well be standard fare!\n\nThe fact that the IT people at the hotel went with Apple's iPad rather than one of the numerous competitors may be of interest to some, though we suspect it's more a case of sticking with the Apple theme than some more deep rooted hatred of Android! Regardless, we're sure it'll make a story somewhere.\n\nWe'd just be happy to stay at the Burj Al Arab, iPad or no iPad!\n\n(source: Twitter)\n\nYou can follow us on Twitter, add us to your circle on Google+ or like our Facebook page to keep yourself updated on all the latest from Microsoft, Google, Apple and the web.\n\nRelated Stories"}

I'll be running the Immortal Longstrike through its paces in a few weeks at the Bowling Green HvZ Winter Invitational, but until then, I'll spend time making it functionally a better blaster for HvZ purposes.\n\n\nDid yours not come with catch springs either?\n\n\nw/ barrel extension\n\nwithout barrel extension\n\nNope Mine did not come with the catch springs. I've already emailed OMW along with a few other issuesSo I finished the install with the 7kg srping, well let's start off with the Pros-direct install, no modding neededCons-7kg spring priming gets tiring after 80+ rounds of constant firingBefore picAfter PicI was able to run some shots off the chrony but before the results I ran into some quality issues with the kitAs stated above mine also did not come with the catch springs. In addition dart fit on the breech was looser than what I am accustomed to from OMW. During test fit some of the darts fell out. I cant use my Xplorer darts because of the fit or any other dart where the diameter is smaller than a stock elite. Stefans, forget it, the performance was horrible (glue tip, xtip, stock tip, back rod, cut down nerf, xplorer). Last but not least the plunger tube was not molded well. For whatever reason mine had some casting or something leftover. I had to do my best in sanding it down without compromising the tube. I will check the o-ring after a few more rounds to see if it is tearing it up. Here are the picsPlunger tube out of the packagePlunger tube afterwardsOn with the Chrony numbers (10 shots, with new elites)92.1195.8890.9290.8892.5389.7698.69100.790.05125.10 (anamoly..)99.82102.5107.3105.4105.4102.0103.1109.9109.9103.6So all in all, the kit is definitely better than the massacre kit. Good performance and can probably get better with some more tweaks and even a brass breech or angel breech. Priming with my xplorer grip was tiring so not sure that will work well in a war. My stage 3 OMW retaliator easily outperforms this kit. But it's a nice drop in kit and this is what the longstrike really needed and should have been from the beginning.Should you buy it? That's a decision left for you decide. I like the kit."}
{"id": 113, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "While Christian Pulisic was offering compelling and historic evidence in Dortmund that he's more than ready to start on the right in this month's vital World Cup qualifiers, his national team coach, Bruce Arena, said Wednesday that he's ready to see another Bundesliga star anchor the U.S. left.\n\nIt's been an issue that's followed Fabian Johnson since he became a U.S. regular in 2012. He's dangerous and dynamic going forward and has spent much of his career as a wide midfielder, first for TSG Hoffenheim and now for Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. But he's an effective outside back as well, and it's there that the USA's need has been greatest.\n\nJohnson started at right back during the 2014 World Cup and then once DaMarcus Beasley stepped aside (temporarily), the Munich native spent more time on the left. Former U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann experimented in an effort to get Johnson higher up the field but never found a solution. Johnson was in back at the 2015 Gold Cup and 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario and made only his second and third midfield starts of '16 in Klinsmann's final two games. Sporting Kansas City center back Matt Besler was out on the left as the USA fell to Mexico and Costa Rica.\n\nSpeaking during a Facebook chat on Wednesday, Arena indicated that he's ready to see if he can steer Johnson toward becoming regular international midfielder.\n\n\"He plays almost on a regular basis as a left-sided midfielder at M\u00f6nchengladbach and if we can, we want to play Fabian in the midfield,\" Arena said. \"So that's obviously one of our goals in 2017, is to find a position for him and allow him to play it on a consistent basis.\"\n\nArena wasn't ready to make a full commitment, however, because spots in back remain unsettled. And with the Honduras (March 24) and Panama (March 28) games coming up, and with at least four points a virtual necessity, Arena may have to keep the tweaking to a minimum this month.\n\n\"I wish I could give you the answer right now,\" he said when asked who was the current first-choice left back. \"All kinds of possibilities exist\u2014from Fabian Johnson, who I indicated our preference is to have him in the midfield. Jorge Villafa\u00f1a and Greg Garza had good showings in January and February with us in camp. Also DaMarcus Beasley showed well in his first game with Houston over the past weekend, so those are all four candidates.\"\n\nArena went on to mention Tim Ream, Besler and Eric Lichaj as dark-horse options.\n\n\"We're hopeful that we're going to arrive at the right plan,\" the manager said.\n\nArena reiterated that he's considering a pool of around 40 players and plans to name a team of 23-25 on March 15. The squad won't gather in San Jose until the 20th, leaving Arena and his staff with the option to make a change or two based on form, injury and what happens that final weekend. They face an interesting challenge. The players with whom Arena is most familiar are in MLS. He coached against them while with the LA Galaxy and spent a month working with them at the recent U.S. camp. But the players who are the fittest and most in-form are in Europe and Mexico. The only interaction Arena has had with them has been from the stands or over the phone. The four days of training leading up to the Honduras game will be vital, as Arena told reporters earlier this week that his foreign-based charges have an edge.\n\n\"The players abroad are certainly match fit and a little bit sharper,\" he said. \"You could see the MLS games this weekend. The teams aren't fit yet\u2014not a whole lot of combination play. They're just starting. It takes time. That's what the Premiership looks like in August as well. It's no different. I think all things being equal, I would think we would lean towards a player who has been playing on a regular basis or training on a regular basis.\"\n\nHe added Wednesday, \"For the most part I was fairly pleased [with the MLS openers]. This weekend is going to be very important for the MLS players as we make our final decisions.\"\n\nArena said he likely would be in Kansas City this weekend as Sporting KC hosts FC Dallas.\n\nHere are a few more highlights from Arena's chat on Wednesday:\n\n\u2014 Regarding the goalkeepers, he said Real Salt Lake's Nick Rimando emerged from January camp with \"a little bit of an edge\" over his domestic competition. Tim Howard has been out since suffering a groin injury against Mexico and wasn't on the active roster when the Colorado Rapids began their season last weekend.\n\n\"We're waiting to see whether he plays for Colorado this weekend,\" Arena said. \"If"}
{"id": 114, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Ask any startup veteran: Mistakes are made. No matter how successful a company ultimately becomes, you can be sure that its early days were peppered with missteps and failures\u2014most minor, but a few likely painful and spectacular.\n\nSo, why would anyone want to share those mistakes with the world? That's the question of the day for Lauren Kay and Emma Tessler, co-founders of Dating Ring, an online matchmaking service. The company is the subject of season two of the podcast Startup, which premieres on Thursday.\n\nStartup devotes each season to chronicling the ups and downs of a single fledgling company. The first season followed the show's creator, Alex Blumberg, as he attempted to launch his own podcasting company. As far as podcasts go, Blumberg is something of a superstar, with successful runs at both This American Life and NPR's Planet Money. That didn't stop him from going off the rails during the show, though. Listeners heard Blumberg stutter through disastrous VC pitches and agonize over whether he was taking the company in the right direction. The tape caught dozens of fraught exchanges between Blumberg and his wife, his partner, his investors and several of his overworked employees.\n\nKay and Tessler say they expect Dating Ring to get the same warts-and-all treatment. (They are continuing to tape through June and will not hear any of the episodes before they air.) Fundraising\u2014\"or trying to\"\u2014will be a major theme of the season, says Kay. The company has raised only $355,000 so far, so listeners will also hear frank discussion of how long the founders can continue without an infusion of cash.\n\nWhat else will we hear this season? A partner leaves the company unexpectedly, say Kay and Tessler. The pair will also discuss the details of their experience at Y Combinator; Dating Ring was part of the incubator's class of January 2014. They say the Startup staff has interviewed a number of people, including Y Combinator partners and the head of competitor Match.com. And of course, Kay and Tessler don't know what was said in these interviews. \"Maybe it will be cool,\" says Kay. \"Or maybe it will be more like middle school, when people would talk about you behind your back.\"\n\nThe pair say that, while they're \"terrified\" of what the podcast may expose about the company (or the founders themselves), they didn't hesitate to sign on when they were selected by the Startup producers. They hope the publicity will boost their user numbers (Dating Ring currently has 3,000 or so active members, about 15% of whom pay the $240 fee for a three-month membership ) and push the company achieve profitability. \"We're really hoping that being on Startup will be the push we need,\" says Kay.\n\nThis isn't the company's first time in the media spotlight. Last year, Kay noticed a striking imbalance in the Dating Ring membership: In New York City, they had far more female clients, while their San Francisco database was dominated by men. So, the company cooked up a stunt: Cross-Country Love, a crowdfunded event where the company flew 16 single female New Yorkers out to the west coast for a long weekend of dates with Silicon Valley bachelors. Not surprisingly, the trip got a lot of press\u2014not all of it positive. Valleywag memorably compared the participants to \"comfort women,\" the women forced into sex slavery in World War II.\n\nWhile much of the coverage was biting, Kay says she still sees the Cross-Country Love trip as a success. \"It was huge for us, it put us on the map,\" she says, adding that in the wake of the publicity, Dating Ring's user base doubled in size.\n\n\"It's totally nerve-wracking to put your professional and personal life out there,\" says Tessler. \"But everything is fair game.\" The founders say were willing to answer almost any question Startup producers threw their way. Because their startup is a dating company, they say they talked a lot about their dating and sex lives, though Tessler asked that the podcast skip the questions about her boyfriend's sex life. \"That's the only place I drew the line,\" she says.\n\n\"Occasionally I didn't record certain things,\" says Kay. \"There were a lot of difficult moments when I was really upset.\" On the other hand, she says the recordings also captured some great moments. \"I had a very emotional conversation with my mom, where she said some of the nicest things she's ever said,\" says Kay. \"Now I'll always have that.\"\n\nFortune plans to follow up with Kay and Tessler once the season is underway. That, says Kay, sounds great, provided \"we are able to show our faces in the media again.\"\n\nTo subscribe to Kristen Bellstrom's daily newsletter on the world's most"}

This is exactly what it's like. And that's what bothers me so much about Bernie right now.\n\nTo me, Bernie is the guy who never got married because he couldn't commit but then turned 40 and realized he was all alone, but instead of finding someone to start a family with, he pursues a married woman.\n\nA woman who has been married for just over 20 years and the youngest kid is just about on their way to start college. She and her husband have their problems, but they love each other and they are learning to focus on each other again after raising a family together. But it's hard. They were married young, because she got pregnant. They struggled a lot early on, because they were poor. But after a lot of sacrifices and a lot of fights they figured out how to make it work and pull ahead and now that their kids are moving out they finally have another chance to have a life together. But there is a lot of work to be done to rebuild their relationship. There is a lot of hurt to heal. It's really hard for both of them, but they love each other and they want to be together. It was really scary for a while there, but if they don't give up on each other, they are going to make it.\n\nThat's the Democratic party to me. Is it perfect? No. Has it fucked up? Yes. But it's also a wonderful party that has done incredible things including electing the first black President and after a lot of ups and downs it's really finally feeling like it's on it's way to being a truly great party again.\n\nAnd just as that is happening, along comes Bernie. He knows how to push all of the buttons pointing out all of the imperfections and fuck ups and pain and he promises a wonderful future and there is no history with him of struggling and fighting and your kids have really seem to like him and it is so tempting to just walk away from a painful difficult history and start over with someone new.\n\nThere was a reply to that comment I quoted above.\n\nYes, party loyalty should come before anything else.\n\nWhen I read that I felt sick to my stomach. Loyalty being talked about as if it were a weakness instead of a strength.\n\nI have liked Bernie for years. Since around 2007/8. But I have never liked that he is running for the nomination of our party. It didn't seem right to me, since he's been an independent for 40 years. But I have really not liked how he has treated this party as he has run. Throwing everyone under the bus who stands in his way.\n\nMy wife and I have been married for over 15 years. In the first few years, we moved to a big city for me to get a programming job and for her to go to college. I didn't get one right away, so, we both ended up getting shift manager jobs at a video store chain. It was a hard time for us, because we were very poor and in a new city all alone and we ended up working opposite shifts from each other, so, we bare saw each other for months.\n\nMy wife and I had pretty different approaches to running shifts. She was by the book and I was more relaxed. She got everything done on time. I made the store a lot of money by making friends with all the customers. My boss quit and for a while her boss ran my store as well. He was a pretty good looking guy who flirted with the girls who worked at the store a lot. He didn't particularly care for my style, but my shifts made more money than any other store in the city and he was stretched pretty thin, so, he just let it go. At least with me.\n\nWith my wife he started talking shit about me. He had already tried flirting with her and it hadn't really worked out for him. He was the kind of guy who didn't take that as a hint. He took it as a challenge. He just tried harder and part of how he tried was to try to put a wedge between her and I. He actually pressed her for why she was with me. I didn't know this was happening at the time, because\u2026 well, because she didn't want me to walk into the store and knock him the fuck out\u2026 but she told me months later when I left.\n\nI have never hated anyone in my life, but I came pretty close with that guy. He wanted something, so he fucked with my marriage to try to get it. I didn't really have anything to worry about, because my wife loves me. But I still felt violated. For her, for having to endure that from her boss. But also"}

Almost nothing is made 100% in the United States anymore. But what about firearms? As one of the few countries that affords its citizens the right to bear arms, you'd think more firearms manufacturers would be exclusively based out of here.\n\nWell, turns out that's not always the case. If you follow the supply chain long enough, you're going to find a part of a product made outside of the United States. But if you're adamant about keeping your hard earned money inside the country and supporting good craftsmanship, we'll discuss a few firearms manufacturers that mostly stay within the United States.\n\nRuger\n\nRuger and Smith & Wesson are almost tied in terms of firearms production and sales in the United States. Ruger, however, tries to keep much of their manufacturing process located right in the United States. Smith & Wesson \u2013 especially for the M&P Shield line of pistols \u2013 stayed within the United States.\n\nBoth are considered the leaders in United States firearms manufacturing. The quality of their arms is well recognized throughout.\n\nA few notable pistols from Ruger:\n\nRuger SR9c \u2013 The SR9c is a compact pistol with full-size capabilities. A magazine capacity of 17 rounds and plenty of accolades on function \u2013 it's an affordable choice for compact concealed carry.\n\nRuger Sr9c Holster\n\nRuger Sr9c Holster Ruger LCP \u2013 This is one of their flagship pistols designed especially to be affordable, reliable, and very concealable.\n\nRuger LCP Holster\n\nKimber\n\nKimber quickly rose to fame with their heavily customized 1911 variants. Hailed as champions of match-grade quality 1911s as well as compact carry versions, Kimber can easily be said to be a company that has focused heavily on craftsmanship over quantity. And it shows \u2013 both in the price tag as well as the function. But, they keep it local and do the vast majority of their manufacturing within the United States.\n\nNotable Kimber pistols:\n\nKimber 1911 Compact \u2013 A slightly more compact 1911, it's for those who want a shorter form factor without sacrificing full-size capability.\n\nKimber 1911 Compact Holster\n\nKimber 1911 Compact Holster Kimber 1911 Pro Model \u2013 How much better does it get in the world of 1911s? Not only does Kimber make a beautifully designed full-size professional grade 1911, it works surprisingly well as an everyday concealed carry choice.\n\nKimber Pro Holster\n\nKimber Pro Holster Kimber Solo \u2013 Kimber decided to dip its feet into the waters of the sub-compact concealed carry community with the Kimber Solo. Despite some complaints on its function, it's overall proven itself to be durable and easily hidden in an IWB holster.\n\nKimber Solo Holster\n\nKel-Tec\n\nA lot of people like to rag on Kel-Tec because their pistols and rifles don't look as sleek and attractive as Kimber or Ruger. If you subtract the aesthetics, you wind up with a fantastic, cheap, and All-American made series of concealed carry pistols. This company has prided itself on staying within the United States despite the easy reduction in manufacturing cost of going overseas. And you know what? They produce excellent concealed carry pistols.\n\nNotable concealed carry pistols:\n\nP-3AT \u2013 This concealed carry pistol, chambered in .380 ACP, has proven itself to be a reliable choice for concealed carriers. It is classified as a sub-compact and no matter how critics want to hate it \u2013 most end up admitting it's a very decent choice for those looking for reliability and price point.\n\nP-3AT Holster\n\nHi-Point\n\nHi-Point makes the Walmart of pistols. Dirt cheap and backed by a life-time guarantee, despite the overwhelming bad talk about their main pistol line \u2013 this is a reasonably reliable American-made firearms manufacturer.\n\nBest of all? Hi-Point is guaranteed to produce a compact pistol in most major calibers that will fit nearly anyone's budget.\n\nNotable compact pistols:\n\nHi-Point 916 \u2013 At less than $200 (MSRP), it's priced to sell. The Hi-Point 916 is surprisingly rugged for it's polymer frame.\n\nHi Point 916 Holster\n\nHonorable Mention: Wilson Combat\n\nWilson Combat's 4-inch 1911 - Wilson Combat's 4 inch 1911 was designed for those who preferred the 1911 frame and need match-grade quality in their concealed carry choice.\n\nWilson Combat 1911 4 inch Holster<\n\nThere are certainly more manufacturers that have a legacy of producing their excellent firearms in the United States.

But what happens when the one who needs fish is a fisherman?\n\nLast month, the federal government took a long-awaited step toward answering that question when Congress allocated $75 million in fisheries disaster aid. Now the hard part begins for the National Marine Fisheries Service. First it must come up with a plan to divide the assistance among six different fisheries nationwide. Then it must determine how to spend the money that goes to each region.\n\nThe New England groundfishery, which targets cod, haddock, and flounders, received its disaster declaration in 2012 following decades of overfishing, and a failure of fish populations to recover despite increasingly strict limits on the catch. In addition to excessive harvest of fish, the ecosystem has also suffered from the compounding challenge of climate change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogether, these factors have left it dangerously out of balance. With this influx of cash, which could represent the last hope for America's first fishery, regulators and fishermen must weigh their desire to provide immediate assistance to industry members against the opportunity to make the entire groundfishery more solvent. The easy path \u2014 one for which some industry members and local politicians have advocated \u2014 would have regulators simply divide the money among active fishermen, allowing them to pay down their loans and perhaps save their boats or houses for another year or two. But then what? This fishery won't recover for far longer than that.\n\nGet Today in Opinion in your inbox: Globe Opinion's must-reads, delivered to you every Sunday-Friday. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here\n\nAccording to a recent report from the National Marine Fisheries Service, groundfish revenue fell by $24 million in 2012, a 23 percent decline. And this plunge doesn't account for drastic reductions in catch limits which took effect in 2013 and will remain for at least another two years. When the revenue figures for 2013 come out, things will undoubtedly look much worse than they do today. Thus, no matter how much of the $75 million ends up in New England, there won't be enough to sustain the industry until the fish come back.\n\nAbsent adequate fish or funding to solve the problem, the only solution is to reduce the number of fishermen, something that is already occurring albeit in an unplanned way. Since 2009, the number of boats making at least one groundfish trip has dropped by 30 percent. And it will fall further.\n\nOne way regulators should help to responsibly manage this loss of fishing businesses, is through implementation a buyback of groundfish permits. While the total amount likely won't be enough to fund the entirety of a buyback program, a relatively small amount of disaster funding could be used for a federal loan guarantee, leveraging additional cash to buy permits from willing sellers.\n\nThose who remain would then pay back the loan over time using a percentage of revenue they generate from having access to more fish. Additional funds could also be made available to cover the first year or two of interest payments. Past attempts to implement buyback programs in US fisheries have shown that designing an effective framework isn't easy, but it can be done. In groundfishery, the industry must develop a structure that allows for a graceful exit from the fishery for those who choose it while preventing a scenario in which the only surviving operators are large vessels consolidated in fewer fishing ports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe program must not simply shift the focus onto other fisheries like monkfish or lobster. And it must allow access to the next generation of fishermen once fish populations have begun to bounce back, with continued participation in traditional ports from downeast Maine out to Provincetown and down to Long Island. Because the upfront cost of a buyback would be low, it could be just a small part of a broader disaster relief package. There would still be funding to alleviate fishermen's financial hardship, to implement programs aimed at protecting smaller fishing communities, and to pay fishermen who remain to engage in cooperative research programs with scientists.\n\nAccepting a buyback will be no easy decision for many fishermen. Any New Englander knows fishing is not just a job. It's a way of life \u2014 often one that spans generations. There will be anguish in leaving it behind. But for some, there will also be relief. And for those who remain, less competition may mean a real chance at a future.\n\nRegardless of how the agency and the industry decide to allocate the funding, it must be used to not just buoy the existing industry, but primarily to invest in its future. They may not be able to give fishermen more fish. But they may yet be able to make this fishery last a lifetime.\n\nMichael Conathanis director of ocean policy at the Center for American Progress."}
{"id": 129, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "When I saw the announcement last week from RunKeeper and Pebble that RunKeeper had released the final non-beta integration with the smart-watch, I was excited to dive into it. While the Pebble watch was certainly not the first smart watch out there (that title goes to a long line of poorly designed watches aimed at geeks like me), it was the first watch to get massive media attention. Which in turn translated to massive Kickstarter sales and funding. Becoming at the time the biggest Kickstarter project ever (by funds raised).\n\nDuring their Kickstarter campaign a year ago both Pebble and RunKeeper had touted the potential integration between the two companies. After all, it was the very first app partnership announced. It seemed like it might just be the start of a new wave of fitness watches driven by the phone. For those not familiar with Pebble as a concept, it's a smart-phone connected watch that displays notifications from apps (be it e-mail, texts or 3rd party apps) on your wrist. The idea was that apps could leverage Pebble for deeper integration and control \u2013 ultimately minimizing the need to remove your phone from your pocket. It would still be there, you just won't have to touch it as often.\n\nHowever, after using it, there's really only one word to describe it:\n\nUnderwhelmed.\n\nNo wait, there's another one. Well, actually, an image might be better:\n\nSo why am I so un-impressed? Well, let's go through a brief overview.\n\nFirst, you'll need the RunKeeper app installed. Quite logically obviously, since in the Pebble 'design', the app is driving the experience. No problems, I had that and was good to go! Note, available on both Android and iOS.\n\nNow, there isn't really any configuration options for the Pebble watch within RunKeeper. You can't turn it on or off, it's just\u2026well\u2026there. You can see it in this tiny little icon in the upper left corner:\n\nEssentially if your Pebble is nearby, it's about to get RunKeeper'd.\n\nOnce that's done, you're basically ready to run. You'll just want to hit the big 'Start Activity' button on the app and stash your phone somewhere.\n\nI stash mine in a simple armband. Nothing fancy.\n\nAbout 15 seconds later, the run will actually start. This is a timer delay built-in to ensure you have time to do the stashing. In the meantime, the Pebble display will now change to the RunKeeper page:\n\nOnce you've started your run, the watch will display your total time, total distance and average pace.\n\nIf you want to pause the timer (like at a cross-walk such as below), you simply press the middle Pebble button, which pauses the app on the phone instantly. Same goes for resuming. I'll give credit where credit is due, this part works well.\n\nNext, if you want to change the display field to something other than pace, you'll just press one of the up/down buttons.\n\nOh.\n\nWait.\n\nYou mean those buttons don't do anything?\n\nOh, I see.\n\nNo worries, I must be able to configure it somewhere else, right? You know, like in the RunKeeper app settings on my phone or something. Or change to speed for cycling? Or trigger a lap, right?\n\nNo, no, and no? Oh.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, what can you do Mr. RunKeeper Pebble?\n\nThat's it? You mean, this post isn't destined for In-Depth Review status?\n\nWell then. That's\u2026uhh\u2026underwhelming.\n\nAnd thus, the end of my Pebble/RunKeeper experience.\n\nI guess I don't get it. As it stands now, the level of coding displayed seems to rival that of what a single high school student could do in an afternoon (without even a can of Mountain Dew or pizza). They had a YEAR to do something cool. And ultimately, it does the most basic thing on earth \u2013 display three non-changeable data fields.\n\nThey had a year to sit there and make a mess of Cambridge whiteboards on creating a kick-ass app that could have shown the rest of the smart-watch world what an app could have done in a connected device scenario. Surely that's 365 days of back of the napkin ideas that could have been implemented.\n\nThey had a year to leverage the power of Bluetooth Smart on the phone platform and do stuff like show heart rate metrics that RunKeeper already supports today. How hard could it really have been to simply add a way to customize the data pages? Or to create laps? Or to show laps since RunKeeper was tracking them anyway.\n\nOn RunKeeper"}

On average, her favorable ratings have been higher than those of her predecessors, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton. This may well reflect the fact that more so than other first ladies, Mrs. Obama has a stand-alone personal image. Unlike other recent first ladies, her popularity has not fallen or risen with her husband's.\n\nHow popular is Michelle? A steady two-thirds of the public has held a favorable view of Mrs. Obama, according to nationwide Gallup poll and Pew Research Center surveys, for most of her time as first lady. At 69 percent, her average Pew Research Center favorable ratings have been only somewhat higher than Laura Bush's (65 percent) but considerably higher than Hillary Clinton's (55 percent) during Bill Clinton's term in office.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLaura Bush was never a polarizing first lady, but views of her soured somewhat near the end of her husband's unpopular second term. In late 2007, her favorable rating fell to 54 percent from a high of 70 percent.\n\nHillary's ratings rose and fell substantially over the course of her time in the White House, reaching a low of 42 percent in early 1996 as fallout from her spearheading her husband's unpopular health care reform effort. But they rebounded over the course of Bill Clinton's second term, especially during the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, when the public rallied sympathetically to the first lady. Her ratings slipped again afterward, even as Bill's approval ratings remained fairly high.\n\nThe arc of Michelle's popularity is strikingly different \u2014 in fact, it's more of a flat line than an arc. Barack's sinking poll numbers haven't dragged down Michelle. As the president's approval score has ranged from the mid 50s to the low 40s, the first lady's have oscillated around the mid to high 60s. The polls do show consistently, however, that in an era of polarization, she has been much less well liked by conservatives, Republicans and white men. Her biggest fans have been women, Democrats and African-Americans.\n\nSo why did the president's unpopularity drag down Laura Bush's and Hillary Clinton's numbers but not Michelle Obama's? In-depth polling about perceptions of her by The Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that broad segments of the public hold positive views of Michelle's personal qualities that transcend partisanship, gender and race. Supermajorities of men and women, blacks and whites, Republicans and Democrats alike see Michelle as intelligent, a good role model for women and a good mother.\n\nAnd even though Republicans, white men and conservatives have held only mixed views of her overall, her strong positive image has prevented a sharp downturn in attitudes among groups that have become super critics of the president.\n\nIn short, more so than other recent first ladies, the public views Michelle Obama as her own person, and her image has not been tied closely to swings in judgments about her husband.\n\nThe numbers inevitably raise the question of what Michelle will do with her popularity \u2014 an increasingly rare asset in these hyperpartisan times. In recent weeks, as rumors circulated that she might run for Senate in Illinois, Michelle quickly quashed them, telling Robin Roberts of ABC News that her next act would be \"service focused,\" not political. Roberts pressed: \"You sure you're not getting into politics?\" Replied Michelle: \"I am positive.\" White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama family friend, was even more Shermanesque in a recent appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"I'm absolutely 100 percent positive that will never happen.\"\n\nThat seems like a pretty firm no. It should also be borne in mind that in this highly polarized era, any political move will be judged in a much more partisan way than Michelle Obama has experienced thus far \u2014 witness how Hillary Clinton's poll numbers have slid as she has reentered the political arena. But should she change her mind, the first lady would have a strong head start.\n\nAndrew Kohut is founding director of the Pew Research Center."}

(Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)\n\nChinese Consulate Behind University Protest Against Dalai Lama\n\nThe University of California\u2013San Diego has invited the Dalai Lama to speak at commencement in June, and a group of Chinese students at the university is rallying to stop his speech. There may be more to the events than meets the eye, however, as a social media posting said to be from the student group states it has been given directions by the Chinese Consulate.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of Tibet and has been in exile since March 1959, when he fled Tibet fearing the Chinese occupiers intended to abduct him. Tibet was invaded by the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) People's Liberation Army in October 1950. The CCP pushes a line that it \"liberated\" Tibet and heavily censors information on the topic, while calling the Dalai Lama a \"separatist.\"\n\nThe group trying to prevent the speech is a local branch of the Chinese Student and Scholars Association (CSSA), a nationwide student organization known to receive funding and directives from the CCP through its consulates in the United States.\n\nThe CSSA has openly stated it is working under the guidance of the Chinese regime.\n\nIt published a statement on WeChat (a Chinese instant messaging platform) that states, translated from Chinese, that \"the Chinese Student and Scholar Association has asked the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles for instructions and, having received the instructions, is going to implement them.\"\n\nIt tells students to not act outside official guidance of the CCP, and says \"specific measures to be taken will be elaborated on in future announcements.\"\n\n\"Our association has been forced to take tough and unyielding measures,\" it states.\n\nThe statement appears to have been taken offline, but a web archive of the page is still available.\n\nThe \"About Us\" page for the CSSA at the university, translated from Chinese, says it is a \"public benefit organization\" and is \"affiliated to the Chinese Consulate General in Los Angeles.\" It also says it works as a \"Chinese Embassy bridge.\"\n\nOvert Espionage\n\nAccording to the report \"China's Espionage Dynasty: Economic Death by a Thousand Cuts,\" published by cybersecurity think tank Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology (ICIT), there are active CSSAs at more than 150 U.S. universities.\n\nOfficially, the CSSAs help native Chinese students by acting as a bridge between China and foreign institutions. On the other hand, \"CSSAs may also be a pivotal overt espionage platform for the Chinese government,\" says the ICIT report.\n\n\"The vast majority of CSSAs receive funding from the Chinese government or have an active liaison via the consulate back to the CCP,\" it states.\n\nIt adds that CSSAs may work to \"persuade students to act as temporary or prolonged intelligence assets,\" and that \"through CSSAs, students can be manipulated into passing intellectual property or research back to their home state or planting malware on a university system.\"\n\nAccording to an FBI podcast on April 14, 2014, it's not uncommon for foreign intelligence agencies to manipulate students to achieve their objectives\u2014and the students are often unaware they are being used until they're already in over their heads.\n\n\"To foster the relationship, foreign intelligence operatives will flatter and encourage students, show interest in their future success, and even promise to help them obtain a government-issued visa or work permit\u2014but it's all disingenuous and empty promises,\" said Mollie Halpem, host of the \"Inside the FBI\" podcast.\n\nShe added, \"The truth is, the operatives are just using the student as a pawn to achieve their own ends, without concern for the student's welfare or future.\"\n\nControlling the Narrative\n\nPreventing a speech by the Dalai Lama at a U.S. university may not seem like a big deal, but for the CCP, its use of censorship and controlled narratives are cornerstones of its hold on power. The Party simultaneously pushes its own narratives on issues, peppered with disinformation, while also using extreme censorship to stop the true narratives from being known.\n\nThe issue of Tibet\u2014which includes the CCP's suppression of Tibetan Buddhists\u2014is one of the CCP's five \"no-go topics,\" which also includes its persecution of Falun Gong, its persecution of Muslim Uyghurs, the issue of Taiwanese independence, and the issue of democracy in Hong Kong.\n\nThe CCP's censorship apparatus stretches beyond its own borders, and looks to control similar narratives being raised by foreign governments and news outlets.\n\n\"In many cases, Chinese officials directly impede independent reporting by media based abroad,\" states a 2013 report from the Center for International Media Assistance.\n\nIt adds, however, that \"more prevalent\u2013and often more effective\u2013are methods of control that subtly"}
{"id": 137, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "The Pentagon has spent billions of dollars on efforts to make itself audit-ready in time for not one, but two deadlines \u2013 one in 2014, the other in 2017.\n\nIt won't meet the first and probably won't meet the second.\n\nThe deadlines represent efforts inside and outside of the Pentagon toward meeting a goal that has eluded it since the mid-1990s, when all government departments were first required by law to submit to annual audits. The Defense Department, alone among all federal agencies, has so far failed to meet that requirement \u2013 leaving trillions of dollars in cumulative annual defense budgets unaudited.\n\nAmid fierce national debate over ballooning national debt, Congress in 2009 passed a law to prod the Pentagon, setting a 2017 deadline for audit-readiness. Two years later, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta added to the pressure, ordering that a significant portion of the Pentagon's books \u2013 its annual report on the status of all appropriations \u2013 be audit-ready by 2014.\n\nThat report, the Statement of Budgetary Resources, is, in essence, the Pentagon's checkbook, showing the amount of money from congressional appropriations spent or committed to being spent, and the amount remaining for new spending. Without it, there is no way to budget accurately or ensure accountability.\n\nTina Jonas, Defense Department comptroller from 2004 through 2008 and now president of UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans, says that when she was drafting budgets, the lack of reliable financial statements made it impossible for her to know how much money the Pentagon had and how much it needed. \"I didn't want to ask Congress for money that we didn't need,\" she says.\n\nA senior Pentagon official confirmed that the 2014 deadline won't be met. The Pentagon discreetly acknowledged the same in an unremarkable passage on page 5 of section II of the November 2012 \"Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan Status Report\" from Defense Department Comptroller Robert Hale's office: \"The scope of first year audits of the SBR (Statement of Budgetary Resources) in FY 2015 will be limited to audits of schedules containing only current year appropriation activity.\" (Panetta's order requires that the SBR be audit-ready in 2014 so that a first audit can be conducted in 2015.)\n\nThat means the audit will ignore the hundreds of billions of dollars in unspent appropriations from previous years, as when, for example, Congress approves a multiyear weapons contract. The reason, Pentagon officials said, is that huge amounts of essential data have been lost in the Pentagon's accounting systems, or were never recorded in the first place. The comptroller's office said that out of $992 billion in appropriations, about $220 billion won't be examined, using estimates based on 2012 numbers.\n\n\"This is a tactical change that refines the scope of the audit,\" said Jennifer Elzea, a spokeswoman for the secretary of defense. \"It does not change the goal, which is to improve the strength of our business processes and the quality of our financial information.\"\n\nComptroller Hale said through a spokesman this month: \"I expect most DoD budget statements will be ready for audit. It is possible that, because of budget turmoil and other problems, a few may not be ready.\"\n\nLack of trustworthy data also makes the 2017 legally mandated deadline a long shot. Absent reliable accounting systems in the military services and other defense agencies, it will remain impossible to trace specific accounting entries to the \"transaction level\" to determine what the money paid for and whether the goods or services were delivered. Rivalries among the military services and Defense Department offices that want to keep their own systems also stand in the way. So does the services' inability to figure out a way to value assets like ships, planes and weaponry.\n\nFor these reasons, says Gordon Adams, an American University professor of U.S. foreign policy and a specialist on defense issues, \"we'll get to 2017, and if past is prologue, the Defense Department will just move the goal posts again.\"\n\nFor decades, fighting and winning the Cold War dominated Congress's permissive approach to annual Pentagon appropriations. Then Congress passed the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1992, requiring annual audits of all federal departments, did lawmakers begin to pressure the Pentagon to manage its purse like any other government department. The law mandated that the Pentagon by audit-ready by 1996.\n\nBut year after year, top defense officials would appear before the House and Senate armed services committees to be scolded for missing their deadlines, and then they would set new ones. The next year, and the next, the scene was re-enacted. Congress and the White House stood back as more than half a trillion taxpayer dollars a year went unaudited.\n\nJust weeks into his new job as secretary of defense under President George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld stated the problem: \"Our financial systems are decades old. According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion"}

But they also started experimenting with game development \ufffd one prototype generated anti-aliased graphics in real-time, while another was able to generate music from places beyond the player\ufffds point of view. .\n\n\nDavid Fox, a founding member of Lucasfilm Games who worked on games like Labyrinth and Zak McKracken, shared stories of trying to pitch what would become Rescue on Fractalus.\n\n\n\ufffdI wanted to do a Star Wars game, but I was told that we were not allowed to do Star Wars titles,\ufffd said Fox, who had joined the company specifically to work within the Star Wars universe.\n\n\nFox says when he first showed his space fighter pilot game prototype to George Lucas, the filmmaker pointed out that Fox had failed to include a fire button -- the developer had assumed players would simply defeat enemies by outmaneuvering them and leading them into crashing into the mountains.\n\n\nSteve Arnold is now an experienced venture capitalist, but back in the early '80s he left Atari to lead Lucasfilm's \"Games Group,\" which would go on to become Lucasfilm Games.\n\n\n\ufffdWe were creating a culture that was designed around innovation,\ufffd said Arnold, trying to explain why Lucasfilm Games was able to produce a remarkably diverse array of games -- BallBlazer, Rescue on Fractalus, Habitat and the like -- in a relatively short span of time.\n\n\n\ufffdOne of the important constraints we had was that we weren\ufffdt working with Star Wars,\ufffd said Arnold. \ufffdWe didn't have to play in that universe -- we got to do our own creation, and we were literally the only group \ufffd outside of George \ufffd within the Lucasfilm company that got to make up new stories and call them Lucasfilm.\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffdGeorge had simple rules for us: \ufffdStay small, be the best, and don\ufffdt lose any money.\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\nTo hear Arnold tell it, those rules were liberating because they inspired the team to experiment with new ideas. The culture of Lucasfilm Games that Arnold remembers was much akin to an indie film studio \ufffd the team wanted to build things that people wanted to buy, but they also wanted to make something artful.\n\n\nChip Morningstar served as a designer and programmer at Lucasfilm Games, most notably as project lead for the early graphical online game Habitat.\n\n\n\ufffdOne of our principles was that we never did anything with the company\ufffds own money \ufffd we had to get someone else to pay for it,\ufffd said Morningstar, who went on to explain how early Lucasfilm Games staffers would keep an \ufffdidea file\ufffd full of game pitches that would be plundered whenever representatives of other companies would visit in order to \ufffdbask in the glow of Star Wars.\n\n\nWhen a representative from Quantum Link came through one day, Morningstar remembers pitching him on the idea of making something like Habitat. The guy went for it, and Morningstar suddenly found himself responsible for leading development on what would prove to be a groundbreaking online game.\n\n\n\ufffdIt was kind of radically egalitarian,\ufffd said Morningstar. \ufffdAlmost all developers\ufffd titles were \ufffddesigner/programmer\ufffd at Lucasfilm Games, and everyone was entitled to contribute.\ufffd\n\n\nRon Gilbert, a veteran developer known for his work on critically-acclaimed games like Maniac Mansion and The Cave, shared his own memories of the relatively flat operating hierarchy"}

He meets up with Tanaka by chance in an elevator, and from that fateful reunion on is slowly drawn into the Otaku lifestyle of making fanfiction magazines, garage kits (modified figurines), and eventually full on anime and video games in an attempt to become the OTAKING- King of the Otakus!After rising to the top, Kubo and Tanaka get screwed, and then have to decide what it was that was really important to them- the grubbing, hand to mouth lifestyle of being an artist and original creator, or selling out and making all the money. There's only one true path for the Otaking, and that's to take it beyond the stars.----The pacing is broken up by the interviews, but the narrative is both engaging and humorous, along with providing a very loose version of how Gainax was started, and their goals of shooting for the stars, both in animation and in business practices. It's very interesting to see how Otaku no Video inspired later works, and drew from the doujinshi (amateur produced works) that put Gainax on the map. Real life science fiction conventions Daicon 3 and 4 (1981, 1983) are explored, which Gainax also produced shorts for. Other character stylings and symbols seen in later works also make appearances, like Kamina's glasses on a building, robots from Gunbuster, and more.-----Portrait of an Otaku:Through a series of live interviews, the movie also explores the lives and disparate interests of those who call themselves Otaku. Garage Kit Otaku, Military Otaku, Anime and Manga, Fanzines, Cosplay enthusiasts, and Fan Video Otaku, and even an art thief are all shown, and asked series of questions that either mock their interests and lifestyle, or that give some insight into what it is that drives them to their obsession.While it's believed that the people interviewed were either Gainax employees themselves (who created their studio to put a name behind their amateur original works, and thereby personifying some of these stereotypes), some of it is plainly staged. Hideaki Anno himself is shown as a Hentai-game addict, even. Typically, the faces and voices are censored, so it's still unknown who some of them are. It's interesting in that they're making fun of Otaku, and at the same time themselves, because that's how Gainax started out: geeks making their own originals to hawk at conventions.The portrait section also provides some hilarious statistics on what Otaku are interested in, and how different groups see different themes. A foreigner was also intereviewed, and it was stated that some 50% of those surveyed come to Japan solely out of anime and manga fandom, and the other half either \"like\" or \"are not opposed\" to it. A fanzine convention survey of 100 Otaku revealed that only 15% of them had cosplayed, and an overwhelming 60% had not. Of those 15 that responded yes, the \"Otaku who did cosplay tended to be repeat offenders\".Another survey included those who \"talk to themselves\", of which the overwhelming majority with 70% did.-----There's also a deep sociological background to Otaku culture; stemming from how a more collectivist culture like Japan operates vs an intensely individualistic one like the US. \"The nail that sticks out gets hammered\" they say, and to a point, it's true. In a collectivist culture, the ideal person fits in with their group, their family, their society, and don't express their individualism much when around others. In private, they can be a night and day different person.The Otaku have long been branded as \"no life losers\", and in a sense shunned from their culture as they're perceived \"deviant\", no different from the US, really. People with anime and manga obsession, people obsessed with doomsday preparation, zombie fanatics, etc.-all these groups share a common thread in that they're on the fringe of 'normative' society. In that, they find a bond together, and create their own subculture outside of the norms.For anyone who's interested in the Otaku culture, this half mockumentary is a great video for insight into what it was like back in the day, even if it's somewhat parodical. In all honesty, what they portray satirically here is not far from the truth, neither in 1991 nor in 2015. There are tons of people out there like the ones shown in this movie, that are obsessive enthusiasts of different fandoms, and though their interests may be broad, they're all bound by a label"}

But despite the sophistication of the android, the Russian President seemed visibly bored by its antics. Perhaps he was imagining something more in the vein of the Terminator, and less like an anemic RoboCop, or a droid you might find at a Jawa yard sale. If I was told that I was going to watch a new warrior robot take a quad bike out for a spin, I probably would've been disappointed how epically unintimidating the end result was, too.\n\nIndeed, the cherry on the cake is that this robot wasn't even driving the vehicle autonomously\u2014\u200bit was operated remotely by a Tochmash engineer.

(Only six -- Hank Bauer, El Tappe, Frank Robinson, Joe Torre, Don Kessinger and Pete Rose -- have occupied the latter role since 1960.)\n\nBy the 1940s managers Connie Mack of the Philadelphia A's and Burt Shotton of the Brooklyn Dodgers wore street clothes long after their playing days had expired, but they were the exceptions.\n\nPresently, MLB's only official rule regarding the matter is 1.11 (a) (1) and states: \"All players on a team shall wear uniforms identical in color, trim and style, and all players' uniforms shall include minimal six-inch numbers on the back.\"\n\nNote that managers are never specifically referenced.\n\nWhen asked about the discrepancy, MLB released this statement: \"The tradition of managers and coaches wearing uniforms has long been an accepted practice and well understood, even without formal rules being in place.\"\n\nMLB managers seem agreeable toward the understood rule regarding uniforms.\n\n\"It's better than wearing a suit,\" White Sox manager Robin Ventura says.\n\nBut it's also a bit perplexing, considering the clubs' trainers wear short-sleeve polo shirts and khaki pants, and their job of working on players' injured joints seems as physically taxing -- if not more so -- as any manager's.\n\n\"It's a lot of work to put on the whole uniform,\" says Orioles All-Star closer Zach Britton, \"especially for the manager when there's no need for you to go sliding or diving.\"\n\n***\n\nWhen eccentric Braves owner Ted Turner made the brazen move to manage his team for one game on May 11, 1977, he crammed a chunk of chaw in his cheek and sported jersey No. 27.\n\n\"He had never been a player, never been a coach, never worn a uniform, but for the day that he was manager, he was outfitted with a uniform,\" Thorn says. \"That tells you something about the strength of the tradition.\"\n\nSome managers dress like their players -- down to the very last detail. Showalter wears stirrups. Bobby Cox wore a cup and spikes for every game.\n\n\"You never see a manager wearing actual cleats \u2026 It was hilarious,\" says Adam LaRoche who played for Cox while with the Braves from 2004-2006. \"It's just his style.

Please refer to this article for further information: http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin...unctions-Eglit Discussion thread - http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin...042#post584042 Original article - http://socioniko.net/ru/articles/quadra-soc-psy.html Notes: Remember. These are +/- descriptions. They're not descriptions of the full functions, which are much, much more complex. They only describe how one Reinin dichotomy (process/result) alters the function -- one out of a possible fifteen. That's right! Just one stinking dichotomy. So don't complain that they're simplistic descriptions of your personality, because they're not meant to convey very much about you anyway.ALPHA-Fe= minimization or avoidance of negative emotions, prevention of quarrels, scandals, and other situations causing emotional instability, which is valued as more important than creation of positive emotional effect.-Ti= global structural logic. Systematic analysis is the instrument that they use in understanding the world. They are primarily interested in the universal laws that govern its workings. To that end, all traditions, conventions and restrictions are discarded. Everything is subjected to analysis, redefinition, analogies. Their main goal that they are pursuing is the creation of a comprehensive, breathtaking, singular picture of the world. The idea of unity, reasonableness and the fairness in all things permeates their vision completely.+Si= positive feelings of comfort. They cannot effectively realize their potential if their lifestyle is full of hardships. Style of activity is characterized by relaxation, freedom, by conveniences. Relations with the external environment, where their activities unfold, must be friendly and pleasant. Their groups are always comfortable, relaxed as if at home, and never rough or eccentric.+Ne= promising ideas. In this quadra, which can be attributed the element of air, there are frequent talks about the future, the unexplored and unknown possibilities. They may seem to be incorrigible dreamers. And this is so: they look out further than anyone, beyond the horizon, they put forward \"crazy\" theories and discuss them with pleasure. Some of these theories, however, are destined to have long lives, so long that they will outlast their creators.BETA+Fe= maximization of positive emotions. Even small doses are enjoyed. Against the backdrop of the dramatic, turbulent emotions that always accompany this quadra, every small occurrence deserving a positive response is seen as an occasion for joy and uplifts their spirits.+Ti= organizational logic. They have a developed sense of duty, citizenship, loyalty to the elected project. It is therefore the most disciplined and organized quadra that knows how to quickly rally its forces in the event of imminent danger or emergency situations.-Se= minimization of weaknesses, i.e. steadfastness in the struggle against deprivation and resistance against the enemy. In this quadra, the force of will is an indispensable condition for effective operation. Persistence, determination, endurance and firmness are always the supreme authority.-Ni= desire to bypass danger. They aim t avoid previously committed mistakes. In their groups, experience, skill, know-how, sophistication are highly valued. They feel confident in extreme situations.GAMMA-Fi= minimization of negative relationships. This element is critical of evil. They desire to get away from bad people and poor relationships, and to protect themselves from enemies and adversaries. They want to minimize negative experiences, because as we know from psychoanalysis, all extruded problems are liable to generate an emotional reaction one way or another, with a physical cost for the purification of the subconscious.-Te= business logic of risk and entrepreneurship. For them it is characteristic to reject that which is useless, insignificant, mundane. This aspect is valued as more important than accumulation and rational consumption. Gammas successfully operate in environments of economic scarcity, where in order to survive it is necessary to use something that may appear useless at first glace, but which is present in abundance.+Se= durability and resistance. This quadra is well capable of defending itself and its position. For them power is not easy to acquire, as to do this they must resist the volitional Beta quadra. However, once it is seized, they can hold on to it despite all attempts at restoration. Protectiveness, ability to defend themselves against all force, ability to keep that which was acquired - these are the principles that they respect. This quadra can be called the quadra of criticism and reforms. In contrast to the 'fire' Beta quadra, which is oriented primarily politically, this quadra is oriented more socially.+Ni= constraining their hot temper, these sociotypes prefer to advance gradually into the future, though they may sharply reject obsolete ideas, criticizing past mistakes.

{"id": 149, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Chris Froome is certain he is on track to contend for a fourth Tour de France victory next month despite his not managing to win the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9, traditionally his warm-up race for La Grande Boucle. The Team Sky leader won the eight-day race in France each time before his Tour victories in 2013, 2015 and 2016 but this year could finish only fourth to the Dane Jakob Fuglsang.\n\n\"I'm not the superstitious type, to think that winning the Dauphin\u00e9 is a precursor to winning the Tour,\" Froome says. \"It's certainly good for the morale and the confidence to win your last race before the Tour but I don't think it's a prerequisite.\"\n\nChris Froome's Tour de France win puts him among greats | William Fotheringham Read more\n\nThe 32-year-old Briton added that. if he was not at his peak in June, that might be explained by the need to keep his powder dry for later in the season. \"I have been very light on race days this year \u2013 going into the Dauphin\u00e9 I was on 19 race days \u2013 but that has been a conscious decision to keep me fresher for what's to come.\n\n\"Potentially with the Tour and the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a afterwards it could be a busy summer of racing. It's worked in the past going into this part of the season fresher. I feel the Dauphin\u00e9 was just what I needed in terms of intensity and it was a very intense Dauphin\u00e9 \u2013 especially the back end of it. When we hit the mountains it was a full-on race and it will have moved me on, condition-wise, a lot.\"\n\nUnlike in other years Froome has yet to score his first win of the season but that barely seems to worry him. However, he professes fascination with a radical route for this year's race that includes nine potential sprint stages and only two genuine mountain-top finishes, at Peyragudes in the Pyrenees and the Col d'Izoard in the Alps, with a third, smaller one at Plateau des Belles Filles in eastern France.\n\n\"I genuinely think this year's Tour route presents the biggest challenge to me that I've faced in my career to date. It's an open course and the level of my rivals is higher than it has ever been. It will be a much closer race in July, more hard fought than we've seen in the last few years. I think what strikes me most is the lack of time-trial kilometres.\"\n\nThere are only two time trials in the Tour this year: 13 kilometres on the opening stage, this Saturday in D\u00fcsseldorf, and 22 kilometres in Marseille on the final Saturday three weeks later. That is a massive contrast with the 1990s and the noughties when there might be two stages against the watch of up to 50 or 60 kilometres, a prologue time trial and possibly a team time trial.\n\nChris Froome wins third Tour de France in Paris \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nIt follows a recent trend, as the 2015 Tour won by Froome had an even smaller amount of individual time-trialling. This year, however, the race is short of obvious set-piece stages, as Froome notes. \"It's not as if it's been made up for with mountain-top finishes, it's also very light on those. It's a very open race. Of course there are some mountain-top finishes \u2013 the Izoard stage, for example, that's going to be a straightforward general classification race up to almost 2,500m. You've got a very open course, almost begging for riders to be more aggressive, to take opportunities to create situations on the road that will lead to exciting racing.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see if that happens or if it's a more controlled race, because the guys are watching and waiting because there are so few typical general classification days, the [favourites] will get their teams to ride and wait for those rather than going for it. It will be interesting to see who is going there with what kind of tactics.\"\n\nThat is far from the only source of speculation. Froome will race this year's Tour against the backdrop of an eight-month long investigation by UK Anti-Doping into allegations of possible wrongdoing at Team Sky in the wake of the Jiffy bag saga. That culminated in the revelation that the team had acquired 55 doses of the corticosteroid triamcinolone between 2010 and 2013, with no paper trail to explain what it was used for. Triamcinolone is banned, unless used under certain conditions with a therapeutic use exemption, and is known to enhance performance.\n\nThere have also been reports of dissent within Team Sky over the affair, with the role of the Sky principal, Sir"}
{"id": 150, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "ESPN college basketball analyst Andy Katz, right, broadcasts courtside. (Phelan M. Ebenhack/Associated Press)\n\nFor the second year in a row, Disney is poised to have another \"Star Wars\" megahit on its hands with the company on track to sell $130 million in U.S. pre-release tickets for next week's \"Rogue One.\"\n\nBut no matter how well it performs at the box office, the film's success may be overshadowed by Disney investors' rising alarm about another part of the Magic Kingdom: ESPN, which is shedding viewers in record numbers.\n\nESPN was thrust into the spotlight in November when the ratings company Nielsen predicted the sports juggernaut would lose 621,000 cable subscribers that month. Nielsen estimated the sports network would lose another 555,000 subscribers in December.\n\nThe staggering losses have led to calls by analysts for Disney to spin off or sell the beleaguered network, which has lost 9 million subscribers in three years, according to company filings.\n\nThe challenges ahead are not unique to ESPN. The pay-TV industry as a whole has seen many consumers trim back their cable subscriptions in favor of online video services \u2014 or, fed up with the rising cost of TV, forgo cable altogether.\n\nWith YouTube TV on the horizon and other streaming services becoming more affordable, it may be time to cancel your cable service. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)\n\n\"There's an underlying theme of the bundle being the problem,\" said Gene Kimmelman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. \"People don't want to pay for what they don't want to get.\"\n\nBut ESPN remains one of the world's most profitable sports networks, and its struggles raise troubling questions about the entire TV ecosystem. Long considered the linchpin of the traditional bundle, live sports is often what compels viewers to stay with their cable provider rather than cut the cord. But as more consumers defect in the face of growing cable bills, what is happening at ESPN could end up affecting channels up and down the lineup. And for Disney, one of the world's most powerful media companies, the problems at ESPN risk dampening the success of its other brands, such as Star Wars, Marvel Studios and Pixar.\n\n\"Most of the Disney empire is healthy, but its stock price has been suffering to the downside because we have weak subscriber growth at ESPN,\" said Laura Martin, a media analyst at Needham and Co. \"So that weak subscriber growth is a shadow over the whole empire.\"\n\nESPN and its siblings, such as ABC, account for the biggest chunk of Disney's business by far, pulling in $24 billion in revenue this fiscal year. The company's next biggest segment, theme parks, made $17 billion.\n\nIt wasn't that long ago that observers were calling ESPN \"the most valuable media property in the United States,\" estimating its value at 20 times that of the New York Times Co. and five times the size of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.\n\nSince hitting a high of nearly $122 in the summer of 2015, the stock has dropped about 14 percent; that includes a 5 percent rally this week.\n\nAlthough ESPN disputed Nielsen's methodology, the ratings firm ultimately stood by its numbers.\n\n[John Skipper is steering ESPN through turbulent times]\n\nA spokesman for ESPN referred questions to the network's parent company. Disney did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nLast month, in an interview with CNBC, Disney chief executive Bob Iger said he remains confident in ESPN. \"We think the long-term revenues are going to be just fine,\" he said.\n\nESPN is hardly the only programming company facing long-term pressure as consumers increasingly opt for Internet-based video streaming that undercuts the legacy cable bundle. TV providers such as Dish Network and AT&T have raced to offer packages of traditional channels as Internet-based apps; the outlook for those efforts is still uncertain, but some analysts say ESPN faces a steeper challenge than most because of the rapidly rising cost to the network of acquiring sports broadcasting rights.\n\n\"Let's face it - sports has changed,\" said Jim Hill, a longtime Disney analyst. \"It's gotten so expensive ... it's a scary time all around the barn right now for sports, and that's another thing that Disney's eyeballing.\"\n\nThe rights to broadcast live sports cost cable companies a collective $16 billion last year, according to a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers \u2014 up 50 percent from 2011. That figure is expected to grow another 30 percent by 2020.\n\nBetween the rising content costs and the defection of consumers, some analysts have proposed that Disney spin off its ESPN unit. This week, Steve Cahall, a media analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the move would allow investors to gain a better understanding of Disney's fundamental profitability. He added it could earn Disney some cash to invest in its remaining businesses, or make Disney"}

It's hard on the pitching staff and it's fatiguing for everybody, but we fought through and played those games well.\"\n\nPaul Goldschmidt hit his NL-best 36th homer for the Diamondbacks, extending his hitting streak to 14 games and increasing his league-leading RBI total to 124.\n\nIt appeared his solo shot in the sixth might hold up, but the Diamondbacks were destined for another extra-inning game. Arizona took a four-hitter into the eighth before San Diego tied it on a passed ball.\n\n\"We have been resilient in these games all year,\" Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson said. \"You have to go through it and we hung in there. It feels good to get this win.\"\n\nGregorius tripled down the right-field line against Luke Gregerson (6-8) to score fellow rookie Chris Owings, who doubled with one out.\n\n\"Luke just hung a breaking ball to Owings and the ball was up to Gregorius that he put enough bat on the ball and hit it hard,\" San Diego manager Bud Black said.\n\nJosh Collmenter (5-4) pitched a perfect inning and Ziegler got three outs for his 12th save.\n\nDiamondbacks reliever David Hernandez gave up consecutive singles to pinch-hitter Mark Kotsay and Chris Denorfia to open the eighth inning. The right-hander then struck out Jesus Guzman, retired Jedd Gyorko on a grounder and intentionally walked Chase Headley to load the bases.\n\nWith rookie Tommy Medica batting, catcher Miguel Montero allowed a passed ball on Hernandez's off-speed pitch that let pinch-runner Reymond Fuentes score the tying run.\n\nArizona starter Wade Miley allowed just four singles, including two infield hits, in six innings. Miley, making his career-high 32nd start, struck out seven, walked one and let just one runner reach third base.\n\nMiley lost all four of his previous starts against San Diego this season.\n\nTyson Ross kept San Diego in the game with eight strong innings, allowing one run and three hits. Ross struck out six, walked two, hit a batter and threw a wild pitch.\n\nGoldschmidt's homer to right-center barely cleared the top of the wall.\n\n\"I wanted it off the plate, but it caught too much,\" Ross said. \"He's one of the best hitters in the National League and he put a good swing on it.\"\n\nNOTES: During his hitting streak, Goldschmidt has six doubles, five homers and 17 RBIs. \u2026 Padres SS Ronny Cedeno wasn't in the lineup after being hit in the head by a pitch from reliever Heath Bell on Monday night. \"He's not doing great,\" San Diego manager Bud Black said. \"The doctors said (Monday) night he was concussed to a certain point.\" \u2026 Padres OF Will Venable (abdominal strain) missed his second straight game. \u2026 Diamondbacks RHP Randall Delgado (5-6, 3.96 ERA) faces Padres RHP Ian Kennedy (6-10, 5.06) on Wednesday night."}

Stevens, and the accompanying details have been reproduced as close to the original sighting report as possible.\n\n19 April 1978, Colfax, Wisconsin\n\nOn Wednesday 19 April 1978, Mr. S. (name witheld (sic) by specific request) and his girlfriend were driving in the vicinity of Tainter Lake, when they decided to stop and attempt some fishing since most of the ice was already thawed.\n\nThey found a spot along the shore where they could do some casting. Mr. S. had also brought along an FM portable radio. They had been at this spot for about a half an hour when the radio began picking up interference. It was then that Mr. S. looked up into the sky, thinking an airplane must be going over-head.\n\nAt that point the object \"appeared\" out of the southwest, moving northeast. He and his girlfriend became very excited and frightened. Remembering that they had a camera with them, (an Instamatic) Mr. S. went and got it to take some pictures. He almost dropped it several times trying to get it out of the case. He finally got it out and started to point it at the object when the object suddenly veered off course in their direction and came towards them. They became even more frightened but Mr. S. was determined to get a photograph of the thing!\n\nAt that point, the object began to circle them at a high altitude as Mr. S. began taking pictures. The object flew around the area only once and then disappeared into the sunlight. The whole incident lasted about 3 or 4 minutes.\n\nMr. S. was hesitant about showing anyone the photos because he was afraid of people thinking the wrong thing. He finally sent a UFO lecturer a copy after attending one of his slide lectures on the UFO subject.\n\nMr. S. was unable to determine the size of the object for lack of reference, or how fast it was moving. He did say, however, that it gave off a \"crackling sound\" as it passed around them.\n\nFrom personal letter:\n\nPhoto #1: Shows the object moments after it veered off its original course. Mr. S. said it slowed down considerably after he took the first picture. He said he had \"the feeling it knew it was being photographed\".\n\nPhoto #2: The object is moving slower now as it begins to make its pass. At this point Mr. S. and girlfriend grew apprehensive. Both experienced extreme fear.\n\nPhoto #3: The object tilts as it begins a \"roller coaster\" type descent. Mr. S. and friend become increasingly frightened. He has the feeling it is going to \"get them\".\n\nPhoto #4: The object has leveled off and is just above the treetop height. It begins moving toward Mr. S. at a slow gliding pace. No sound comes from the object but Mr. S. remembers he left his transistor radio on and it is \"buzzing\" and \"crackling like crazy\".\n\nPhoto #5: Mr. S. turns his camera sideways to get this shot of the object as it passes almost directly overhead. At this point Mr. S. experienced a sensation of \"heat\" as well as \"prickling sensation\" around and \"in\" his head and eyes, however Mr. S. stated that he experienced no permenant or temporary after-effects except a bad case of the \"jitters\". This shot was taken while Mr. S. was in a crouched position and remembers falling over on his back afterwards. He said he noticed an \"amber or orange-red light\" underneath in addition to several small lights which would blink on and off erratically for different lengths of time. (See Photograph) He also noticed 4 \"pods\" or \"landing gear\". The bottom appeared to be a \"dull\" black. The shock of falling backwards prevented him from taking any more pictures of the object as it continued overhead.\n\nThe object has now climbed back up into the sky as Mr. S. shoots this picture.\n\nPhoto #7: Shows the object heading into the sun. At this point it began to pick up speed and soon was lost in the sunlight. Mr. S. took 9 pictures in all, only these 7 turned out.\n\nView the: Colfax UFO Case Drawing.\n\nPopular Posts:"}

Speaking to The Independent on the phone from her office in America, Carter began the conversation by talking about the success of Challenge TV's British Bootcamp 2, the reality show which was won by TNA standout Rockstar Spud in its first instalment.\n\n\"I'm proud of the show, the first season was very successful, our ratings have doubled for this one which is almost unheard of, and there is such a great talent pool from the UK and Ireland.\n\n\"I hope this show has given everyone a shot in the arm to raise their game and to define their characters more, because if they really take the process seriously, every single one of those talents should come out better for it.\"\n\nOne such talent on the show which has attracted much attention over the course of the show has been Grado, who has become one of Britain's biggest stars in the recent past, stemming from his appearances in Insane Championship Wrestling and his strong YouTube fame. Carter likes what she sees in the comedic Scot, who recently finished in the top six of the show.\n\n\"I'm a big Grado fan, and I'm excited about him, and the other five finalists being on the upcoming UK tour, and there is something about him that I know he will try to steal the spotlight from everybody. He didn't get off to a good start with Al Snow in particular, he felt it was Grado's downfall that he didn't take it seriously enough, that he felt he could funny his way through it, and it really bothered Al, which could have kept him from winning.\"\n\nGrado has spoken about possibly facing Snow on the tour, and that is something that has piqued the interest of the TNA President.\n\n\"He has been on at me for that to happen, and Al Snow is in as good condition as he has ever been in, he loves stepping into the ring but Grado would have the entire UK with him. Al would take that match very seriously, and he should be prepared.\"\n\nTNA has achieved a startling degree of success in the UK, thanks to their flagship television show Impact being aired on Challenge TV, and the company tour yearly in arenas which attract thousands of fans.\n\nThis year, all six of the final contestants from British Bootcamp 2, Noam Dar, Kay Lee Ray, Rampage Brown, Dave Mastiff, Mark Andrews and Grado will be appearing on the shows, as well as TNA World Heavyweight Champion Bobby Roode, Magnus, Rockstar Spud, James Storm, MVP and more. The events, in Glasgow, Manchester and London will also all be taped for television, which has excited Carter.\n\n\"The UK has been such an integral part of the success that we have had, it gave us an early success story when we needed one with the television ratings, ticket sales and media exposure. Now having British Bootcamp, and the tours getting bigger, I wanted to raise the bar this year and I needed to know from a scheduling standpoint in the US that I could turn the UK shows into TV tapings so I was thrilled to announce that.\n\n\"Having the British Bootcamp participants on the shows is great, and I want the fans to get there early, from the time the doors open for it to be a party atmosphere, and to make it fun and special.\"\n\nAfter a nine year relationship with Spike TV, TNA has signed a deal to partner with Discovery Communications, and Impact will begin to air on Destination America in January 2015. Despite some wrestling insiders tipping the switch as a backwards move, Carter was positive about the change, and the possibilities that the partnership can bring.\n\n\"I'm very excited about it, we talked with a lot of networks and at the end it came down to that I was looking for somebody who didn't want to just license a two hour television show, but somebody who wanted to be a true partner. This deal is not just about Impact on a network, and it's not just about being part of a group of networks in the US which are the largest and who have vowed their support, it's about the global reach, and I'm very confident we can help Destination America, and be one of the"}

But as of Tuesday morning, the document could not be accessed through the original link.\n\nIt was disabled by Lunaweb Ltd., which runs upload site DocDroid, \"because it seems to be leaked'' and DocDroid is \"simply not the right place,'' said Lunaweb's Josias Montag.\n\n\"Such documents should be published on WikiLeaks; they do have the resources and experts for such things.\"\n\nThe Canadian Press could not confirm the document's authenticity and Jeremy Laurin, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney, would not comment.\n\nLaurin said Tuesday that officials \"continue to monitor this situation closely.\"\n\nOne senior official said it was still unclear Tuesday as to whether the document, which appears to be genuine, was indeed pilfered by hackers, or simply leaked.\n\n\"There are obviously concerns about the document being released, except there's no confirmation it has been obtained through a hacking,\" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nAnonymous has carried out cyberattacks against governments, corporations and others in the name of free speech, Internet liberties and anti-capitalist causes.\n\nIn a video statement discussing the document, Anonymous denounced the July 16 fatal shooting of a supporter in Dawson Creek, B.C., during a confrontation with the RCMP.\n\nOfficers challenged and subsequently fired on the man, who was wearing a Guy Fawkes mask - an Anonymous trademark - outside a public hearing for a dam project to be built by BC Hydro.

At year end, the average price for benchmark DDR2/DDR3 was $591 retail, with promotional pricing pushing that below$550 as predicted. Today, we're seeing DDR3 begin to overtake DDR2 in the 8GB ECC category, dropping below $510/stick, while DDR2 climbs to $550/stick (promotional, on $625/stick retail.)\n\nIn 4GB ECC configurations, DDR2 enjoys only a slight retail advantage (13%) while promotional pricing (likely due to inventory reduction initiatives) are providing a bit better value short term. However, the price gap is only 1/2 the power gap, with DDR3 delivering a greater than 35% reduction in power over its DDR2 equivalent (about $1.25/year/stick at $0.10/kWh). The honeymoon is almost over for DDR2.\n\nSOLORI's Take: With strong DDR3 demand and short-falls in DDR2 supply (according to DRAMeXchange), the only thing keeping DDR3 prices above DDR2 at this point is demand and inventory. As Q2/2010 introduces a rush of new workstation and server products based on DDR3 systems, the DRAM production ramp will eventually stabilize demand somewhere towards the end of Q3/2010. Meanwhile, technology companies like VMware, Microsoft, Intel and AMD are betting on new infrastructure spending on operating systems, virtualization and hardware refresh to drive-up economic market factors.

Seattle, too. Also Miami.\n\nBut that's all explained, at least partially, on the business's website. Owners Daniel and Patricia Carvalho lived in Seattle and New York but moved to Brazil, where, in 2010, they opened the first Brooklyn Coffee Shop as a paean to Seattle's favorite liquid and Brooklyn's neighborhood bistros. That location in Curitiba and a second one there continue, though its Facebook page makes a lot of references to Orlando.\n\nThe Orlando BCS takes the space most recently occupied by Restaurant Ash, which was also the original Funky Monkey Wine Co. So there's a kitchen to be put to use.\n\nThey fire it up in the morning for breakfast fare such as Shakshuka, house-made doughnuts and a variety of dishes with eggs, including empanadas.\n\nIt continues through lunch with the morning menu available plus a variety of salads, sandwiches and other empanadas.\n\nIt's clear that empanadas are a specialty, so I had the Pastel de Carne when I stopped in for a late lunch. It was filled with lots of shredded brisket, seasoned with garlic, onions and chili spicing. The turnover-like device had a wonderfully flaky crust, at least on the top. When I picked it up I found the bottom part quite moist. This apparently was from the fatty brisket, so it just added flavor. Lots and lots of flavor. It was even better when dipped in the mildly spicy chimichurri.\n\nI also had the Bauru sandwich. Bauru is a traditional Brazilian sandwich that is usually made with roast beef and melted cheese, typically mozzarella. For some reason -- perhaps in an attempt to Brooklynize it? -- here it is made with Canadian bacon and swiss cheese, unmelted, along with tomato and sliced pickles. What makes this odder is that the restaurant's website says this sandwich is made with brisket. And since we know that brisket is available for the making of empanadas, why Canadian bacon?\n\nWhatever. It was a very good sandwich, with plenty of meat, and a buttery taste in the toasted bread. I don't think it quite warranted the $8 fee, especially served solo. (The $3.50 charge for the empanada was fair.)\n\nAnd then there's the coffee. It's a bit strange that a place named Brooklyn would specify Americano as a choice. I'd think that would be the default. The beans are from Panther Coffee in Miami. This would have been a great chance to bring in the Seattle connection, or even the South American angle.\n\nMy $2.50 cup of Americano, served in a Christmas themed mug, was only so-so.\n\nLittle seems to have been done with the interior other than moving some furniture around. To wit, a hightop communal table that was near the front window is now in the back of the restaurant. The Edison lights that hung low over the table remain, below head level. Screws and hangers where photos and other accouterments of the previous occupant used to be are still in the walls. Some sprucing up may be in order.\n\nBrooklyn Coffee Shop is at 912 N. Mills Ave., Orlando. It is open for breakfast and lunch daily, with dinner hours to be announced soon. A brunch menu is served on Saturday and Sunday. The phone number is 407-704-1757"}

But making use of these traits directly is not pretty:\n\nfn cube<T>(x: &T) -> T where for<'a> T: Mul<&'a T, Output = T>, for<'a,'b> &'a T: Mul<&'b T, Output = T> { x * x * x }\n\nEventually, we might get some (slightly) higher level traits, which would reduce the noise. For example: T: Mul2 could imply T: Mul<T> + Mul<&T> and &T: Mul<T> + Mul<&T> . But at the time of writing this, the Rust compiler does not seem able to handle this. At least I could not successfully compile the following code:\n\nuse std::ops::Mul; pub trait Mul2 where Self: Mul<Self, Output=Self>, Self: for<'a> Mul<&'a Self, Output=Self>, for<'a> &'a Self: Mul<Self, Output=Self>, for<'a,'b> &'a Self: Mul<&'b Self, Output=Self> {} impl<T> Mul2 for T where T: Mul<T, Output=T>, T: for<'a> Mul<&'a T, Output=T>, for<'a> &'a T: Mul<T, Output=T>, for<'a,'b> &'a T: Mul<&'b T, Output=T> {} fn cube<T: Mul2>(x: &T) -> T { x * x * x } fn main() { let c = cube(&2.3); println!(\"Hello, world! {}\", c) }\n\nI think it's safe to say that things will improve in this area. For now, the ability to generically implement numeric algorithms in Rust is not as good as I would like it to be."}

AG Kathleen Kane\n\nWhy did the AG drop a case that exposed Democratic corruption?\n\nProsecutors almost never go to war against each other. But in Pennsylvania, Democratic attorney general Kathleen Kane is being brutally criticized by Seth Williams, Philadelphia's district attorney and a fellow Democrat. Williams is upset that last year one of Kane's first acts in office was to decline to prosecute four Philadelphia state legislators and other government officials. In a sting operation, all had been caught accepting cash or Tiffany jewelry in exchange for votes or favors. Kane, who is white, has defended herself, saying that the investigation was badly managed and tainted by racism. She claims the criticism comes from what she calls the \"Good Ol' Boys Club.\" Williams, who is African American, has shot back: \"I have seen racism. I know what it looks like. This isn't it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#ad#The sting operation followed pretty much the same playbook as the federal Abscam investigation of the 1970s. Begun in 2010, the Philly probe was conducted under Kane's three immediate predecessors as attorney general, and it resulted in more than 400 hours of video and audio recordings. Tyron B. Ali, a lobbyist originally from Trinidad, served as the undercover agent; after he was charged with fraud, he agreed to wear a wire in exchange for lenient treatment. Word of his cash offers eventually got around and prompted some elected officials to call him first. \"Sources with knowledge of the sting said the investigation made financial pitches to both Republicans and Democrats, but only Democrats accepted the payments,\" the Philadelphia Inquirer reported last week.\n\nAttorney General Kane inherited the investigation when she took office in January 2013. She told the Inquirer that she stopped it without filing any charges because it was \"poorly conceived, badly managed, and tainted by racism.\" She quoted Claude Thomas, the chief investigator in the case, as saying he had been ordered to target \"only members of the General Assembly's Black Caucus\" and to ignore \"potentially illegal acts by white members.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response, Williams issued an angry statement and penned an op-ed in Sunday's Inquirer. \"The notion that they would target anyone based on race is ridiculous,\" Williams said in a statement. \"I am confident they are not racist, and it is regrettable that the attorney general would casually throw around such an explosive accusation.\" Thomas, who is also African American, now works for Williams and denies he ever made such a statement.\n\nWhat is clear is just how damning some of the collected evidence is. The Inquirer reported this exchange between Ali, the lobbyist, and state representative Vanessa Brown:\n\nAli went to Brown's office and handed her an envelope with $2,000, according to people who have reviewed a transcript of a tape Ali made on that day. As Brown accepted the money, they said, she put it in her purse and said: \"Yo, good looking and Ooowee. . . . Thank you twice.\" After he gave Brown the money, Ali urged her to vote against a bill that would require voters to show identification at the polls, the sources said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKane's supporters say that federal law-enforcement officials she consulted believed the probe had suffered from a lack of \"quality control\" and could be viewed as entrapment. \"Is the acceptance of cash alarming? Absolutely,\" one person close to Kane told the Inquirer. \"But you've got to think: I've got to try this case.\"\n\nIt certainly may have been politically awkward for Kane, as a Democrat, to prosecute only African-American defendants, but a conviction on something should have been a slam dunk. Even if prosecutors couldn't prove a quid pro quo, it is illegal for politicians to accept payments to enrich themselves and also illegal not to report the income. Further, the prosecutors in this case have a sterling track record in securing convictions against the leadership of both parties in the legislature, winning 21 convictions in the 2010 \"Bonusgate\" scandal, which involved illegal payments to legislative staffers who performed political work. All of those convicted were white.\n\nKane has declined to answer detailed questions about why she dropped the investigation. Her critics, she says, are \"playing political games to discredit me in order to fulfill their own selfish and improper agenda.\" When she met with Inquirer editors last Thursday, she brought her personal attorney and on his advice declined to answer any questions after the meeting. Her attorney says she may file a defamation suit against the paper, a ploy frequently used by public figures to intimidate journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams says he is tired of Kane's \"escalating excuses.\" He points out that when she took office, the files on the probe were with federal prosecutors who hadn't yet concluded whether they wanted to pursue their own case. \"All she had to do was leave the investigation in the hands"}

The militants received overwhelming blows in Homs and Qalamoun. Today in Aleppo, any military expert understands the meaning of controlling the central prison and the air force intelligence site in the city. Everybody recognizes that Aleppo is almost militarily fallen. Of course, cleansing it of militants and terrorists may need time. But the battle there, according to military battlefield logic, has already been decided and its results are clear.\"\n\nIn response to claims that the regime's opponents have provided the government a great service with their behavior and mistakes, he smiled, saying, \"This is absolutely true. Suffice it to mention two things: first, their collaboration with Israel and their openness to several contacts with it. That really helped us in our media battle in the Arab world. Second, and more importantly, the significant dominance by extremists and terrorist groups over those forces.\"\n\nAl-Monitor asked about allegations that the regime released fundamentalist prisoners to facilitate the formation of these groups. The Syrian official answered calmly: \"It is true that a number of fundamentalists were released as a result of amnesty decrees for prisoners by the leadership in Syria during the years of strife. But the domination of extremist groups on the armed groups and their aspiration to control Syria preceded any act by us. Don't forget that the battle with these extremist groups began more than 30 years ago. It didn't break out in 2011. [It broke out] before the conflict [in our region] turned into open military battles. [Al-Qaeda leader] Ayman al-Zawahri was clear in his recorded message when he raised the slogan, 'The glory of the East starts in Damascus.' \u2026\n\n\"Of course, we worked through all media, political and diplomatic means, to expose the extremist danger on us and on all our surroundings and the world. This is part of our natural and legitimate response to the terrorist plot. You only need to read the message by Zawahri to an extremist group that he disagreed with, namely, the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). He told them that one of the reasons why he disagreed with them is that they came out into the open. Al-Qaeda wanted to keep its battle secret until it was strong and could gain control. This is proof that the first way to fight them is to reveal their true image and highlight their presence and their danger, and that's what we did.\"\n\nThe official continued, \"It is important now that the war between them has become very fierce, especially after the split between their groups became an expression of the divide between the countries that were sponsoring and funding terrorists in Syria. One battle between two factions, ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra, resulted in 1,400 people dead. Remarkably, in this area, they themselves have become aware of their own destiny and where they are headed. It is no coincidence in this context that Zawahri himself, in a message addressed to the battling rival extremist groups in the first week of April [2014], described some ISIS militants killing an Ahrar al-Sham official as a major crime. More importantly, Zawahri compared it to the incident where the Islamic Fighting Group in Algeria assassinated two other Islamic jihadists in 1995. Zawahri concluded, in his message, that what the Islamic Fighting Group did in Algeria that day was 'the moral death of those groups, which was followed by their material death.'\"\n\nThe Syrian official smiled at Zawahri's comparison of events in Algeria two decades ago to present-day Syria. The official said, \"By making this comparison, al-Qaeda's leader wanted to threaten the terrorists beyond his control with death, as happened in Algeria. But he didn't pay attention, in that he expected the war in Syria to have a similar fate to their war in Algeria. The result there was that all terrorists and extremist groups were defeated and the state won and it is still in place to this day, and this is what will happen in Syria.\"\n\nWhat about the recent US escalation and Washington's willingness to boost military aid to the opposition? The Syrian official's face turned more serious. \"A few weeks ago, we agreed with our allies in Russia that a high-level delegation from Moscow would visit Damascus. We were officially informed that the delegation will be headed by the Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov. But two weeks ago, officials in the Russian Embassy in Damascus surprised us by telling us that the date of the visit has been postponed for four days. We asked why.

In fact, project leaders participated in 559 meetings with community leaders, local officials and organizations to listen to concerns and fine-tune the route. The company asked for, and received, a tougher federal permitting process at sites along the Missouri River. This more difficult procedure included a mandated review of each water crossing's potential effect on historical artifacts and locations.\n\nProtesters claim that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers failed to consult tribal leaders as required by federal law.

The next month, a meeting was arranged, but \"when the Corps timely arrived for the meeting, Tribal Chairman David Archambault told them that the conclave had started earlier than planned and had already ended,\" according to a federal judge.

National Assembly Budget also funds the National Institute for Legislative Studies, which is a legislative think-tank and highly rated academic institution that serves both National and State Houses of Assembly and even international legislators.\n\n\" All these agencies also have their capital budget including development of their headquarters, procurement of office equipment, procurement of regular items for running their offices; the National Assembly maintain legislative aides of about 3,000 in number, that aid the work of the Assembly; it also conducts regular public hearings involving the media and stakeholders and oversight activities, involving huge sums of money.\n\n\"The cost implications of running the National Assembly is high because of the nature of our Presidential democracy. Then of course, there are 109 Senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives, that require proper equipment to function effectively.\n\n\" They require adequate travel and transport support to carry out legislative functions. The National Assembly also has buildings and offices to build and maintain. \"National Assembly staff and members attend conferences, trainings, seminars to keep abreast of legislative developments worldwide. The activities are very encompassing and expensive.\n\n\" It is also unbecoming of a former President to quote figures of sums of money that are factually incorrect. No member of the House of Representatives receives N10m every month. The salaries and allowances of members of the House are as determined by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC).\n\n\" Of course further sums of money are spent as running costs, that is, the cost of running the office of a member. If a Minister, Chief Executive or Director in a Ministry travels on official duties, for instance, do you include the cost of his ticket and accommodation as part of his salary or allowances? Does the cost of stationery and maintenance of equipment like computers used in their offices, form part of their salaries and allowances? These are some of the costs that must be taken care of by the National Assembly and the media calls these costs \"jumbo pay\".\n\n\"For goodness sake, the National Assembly is an arm of government, not just an ordinary agency of government.\n\n\"The Budget of many agencies in the Executive Branch are indeed higher than the current Budget of the National"}

They encountered harsh conditions and suffered extreme hardships, cut off from communication with the outside world. It took years of planning, then years of recovery, for these explorers to even begin to understand what they went through \u2013 let alone to describe what they discovered.\n\nOver one hundred years later, filled with probably just as much excitement and anticipation, a new group of explorers has again journeyed to Antarctica. After years of planning, the Antarctic Peninsula Paleontology Project, or AP3, an international team of scientists, of which I am a part, headed off to probe a new frontier of Antarctic exploration. Our mission was not to discover the South Pole, but to find evidence of ancient life on a continent largely void of anything alive today. Would we really get there? Could I carry my own weight? Was my mom justified in worrying like I was her six-year-old daughter, not a 36-year-old professional paleontologist? These questions, among others ran through my mind, as I got ready to join 11 other paleontologists for this extreme fieldwork experience.\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Taking the Zodiac to the shore from the Nathaniel B. Palmer icebreaker ship Photograph: Kerin Claeson\n\nThis amazing journey was made possible thanks to a merger of science and technology, of geologists and paleontologists, pilots and professors, seafarers and students, of Mother Nature and Deep Time. With the generous support of the National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs, the AP3 was able to venture to the Antarctic to answer questions about life near the end of the Age of Dinosaurs. As the name of our project indicates, we targeted a region of Antarctica known as the Antarctic Peninsula, specifically the islands within the James Ross Island Group.\n\n\nThese islands were once covered by ocean, when non-avian dinosaurs roamed the land, giant marine reptiles swam the seas, and swarms of strange fish schooled along the shores. We know the Antarctic Peninsula was warmer back then, teeming with plant and animal life, yet we know so little about the species that lived there. Therefore, we sought to travel to Antarctica ourselves, to collect data to answer questions about the extinct ecosystems that inhabited the continent during the Late Cretaceous and Early Paleogene. Actually getting there was among the first of the many significant hurdles that the AP3 team would eventually overcome.\n\nUnlike Shackleton, who met with unexpectedly formidable sea ice and was to surrender his vessel to a frozen horizon, the AP3 was fully informed of the ice conditions on and around the Peninsula. In 2013 and 2014, there were near record amounts of sea ice surrounding the James Ross Island Group. Those would have been the first two years of our AP3 expedition, supported by the US Antarctic Program research vessel Laurence M. Gould. Warned in advance, however, we knew we were going nowhere and cancelled those field seasons. Fast-forward through two years and lots of negotiations, and we were ready to defy the sea ice via passage on the Nathaniel B. Palmer (NBP), a larger ice-breaking vessel equipped with small boat and helicopter support.\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The team's campsite in Antarctica Photograph: Kerin Claeson\n\nThen (wouldn't you guess it?) 2016 was among the warmest austral summers on record, with little sea ice and extensive exposure of potentially fossil-bearing rock. So, it took AP3 only four years of patient preparation, two days of flights to reach Chile, five days of polar field-camp and preparedness training, and four days of cruising through the Straits of Magellan, Drake Passage, and Weddell Sea before we took a short Zodiac ride to the shore of Vega Island on February 13, 2016. We had made it, and we were ready to science day and night for the next five weeks, on and off the shores of the islands in the James Ross group.\n\nOf course we were not done facing the elements: water, earth, wind, but no fire (no wood means no campfires and no marshmallows!). By water, I mostly mean the frozen sort. We were not permitted to traverse over ice, much to the dismay of all my friends and family who honestly hoped we would be the team to actually uncover The Thing. No, we were intent on prospecting and digging for fossils, so regardless of potential safety issues, we simply avoided travel over glaciers. We stuck to exposed rock and soil surfaces, of which there were many, and fortunately for the AP3, most of these areas were filled with fossils peeking out of the earth.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Part of a fossil fish skull recovered this year Photograph: Kerin Claeson\n\nWe encountered a lot of frozen ground, which actually was great to work on \u2013 that is, until it thawed later in the day and we (well"}

Tax dollars from a special sales tax will pay for $66.4 million dollars of equipment. It will connect police, fire and emergency medical crews on special radio channels when multiple agencies are needed for a natural or manmade emergency.\n\nSt. Louis County Public Safety Supervisor Daniel Davis said surrounding counties are in the process of joining the communication effort. The terror attack on September 11, 2001 magnified the old system's shortcomings.\n\n\"We didn't have the capability for police, fire and medical to talk to one another,\" Davis explained. \"Now we can supply a radio channel for a particular incident or a tornado. Everybody can speak with one another to give optimal service in the area where it's required.\"\n\nThe unified system should reduce the time it takes for commanders on the scene to reach first responders when additional help is needed.\n\nA new emergency operations center is now open and the county's outdoor tornado siren system has been upgraded thanks to the special emergency communications sales tax that was approved by voters in 2009.\n\nThe operations center includes a new 911 answering and police dispatch facility that is large enough to accommodate countywide dispatching service if that is needed. Forty agencies contract with St. Louis County for dispatching service.\n\nNineteen other 911 answering centers exist in St. Louis County. Municipal police departments own and operate the other centers. Some of them offer service to smaller police departments under a contract. St. Louis County provided the upgraded radio equipment to each of those centers.\n\nBut each 911 center has its own computer dispatching system. Emergency 911 calls made with cell phones can also produce varying results.\n\n\"There are still many cell phones out there using older technology. Those cell phone companies are not able to provide us with exact coordinate information for where the call is originating from,\" Davis said.\n\nCell phone users need to give dispatchers their precise location to insure first responders can find them.\n\nSt. Louis County is in the process of upgrading the 911 system but cell phone owners and their service providers must also improve their technology. \"The next generation 911 will certainly allow us a little better ability to pinpoint cell phone users and as everybody upgrades their cell phones and the older technology phones go by the wayside then we'll certainly be able to do a better job pinpointing where they are calling from,\" said Davis."}

Macron, 38, is popular among centrists and could take votes from Juppe in the presidential election.\n\nPolls show the bigger the turnout the better are Juppe's chances in the primaries. Party managers are working furiously to get the vote out.\n\n\"What matters is not how loud the crowd is but who turns up to vote,\" said Gilles Boyer, Juppe's campaign director.\n\nFrench politician Alain Juppe, current mayor of Bordeaux, a member of the conservative Les Republicains political party and candidate for the centre-right presidential primary, arrives to attend a political rally as he campaigns in Bordeaux, France, November 9, 2016.

Old buildings have been cleaned up, a tram network built and the Garonne river quays opened to the public.\n\nHe has worked with local left-wing mayors and promoted inter-faith dialogue, which differentiated him from Sarkozy, who has mocked Juppe's political alliances and taken a hard line on Islam.\n\nThe two candidates' economic policies are largely similar \u2014 cutting public spending and scrapping a tax on the wealthy. But aides say that, unlike Sarkozy, Juppe can unite people across party lines.\n\n\"He is shy and not much of an extrovert and doesn't much like to talk about himself,\" Virginie Calmels, Juppe's deputy in Bordeaux, said in an interview. \"But he is a statesman, he is pragmatic and he brings people together.\"\n\nJuppe's long political history has come under scrutiny in this latest campaign.

Then they tried to lure them back to their zoo pen with corn. Then they tried to catch them with a net, and almost snared one of them in a coyote trap, which proved too small.\n\nAnd then they finally found something that worked: Blocking cars and people from an area where one of the capybaras was known to lurk, deploying a larger cage out in the open, and watching patiently as they waltzed inside, as one did Sunday evening.\n\nNow \u2014 with that rodent back at the zoo, recovering from its ordeal \u2014 the searchers have to do it again.\n\n\"(The second) one's going to be posing its own challenges,\" said Ben Lovatt, a local museum owner who has participated extensively in the chase, along with park staff and rescuers from the Toronto Wildlife Centre.\n\n\"We're giving it some time. This one's going to require a lot more study and observation before people actually go in.\"\n\nThe first capybara was retrieved Sunday evening in the park's southeast corner, near the drainage area of a pond, where passersby had spotted them in the days before the rescue. It came nearly three weeks after the animals \u2014 new arrivals to the High Park Zoo from a breeding program in Texas \u2014 absconded from their pen and disappeared into the park's array of trees, trails and creeks.\n\nThe search party, since then, has relied heavily on reported sightings, and on the help of Lovatt and a few other private citizens, who have spent dozens of hours in recent weeks tracking the animals' movements and behaviour.\n\nThat reconnaissance led to the first capture, said Megan Price, a spokeswoman for Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation. In a game of wits, they don't plan to stray from what has worked.\n\n\"The second plan is the same as the first plan: To narrow down, through sightings, the area that it might be located, and then to spend a couple of days looking at its patterns and its habits and where it is, so that we can really situate the traps in the best possible locations,\" Price said.\n\n\"We've had a couple of credible sightings. We're following those up,\" she added, declining to specify exactly where the second rodent has been seen.\n\nRescuers aren't sure which capybara they captured Sunday, and which one remains loose. One is male and the other female, but both are around six months old. Due to their youth, Price said, the veterinarian who examined the captured animal \"wasn't able to ascertain the gender.\"\n\nRegardless, the rodent was deemed healthy, save for a few minor scratches.\n\nThe fundamentals, meanwhile, are in place to make the second apprehension. Once sightings of the second animal become fixed in one area of the park, staff will block off nearby roads and paths, as they did on the weekend.\n\n\"It was great that they were able to cordon off the area and keep people back and keep people away,\" said Nathalie Karvonen, the executive director of the Toronto Wildlife Centre, whose cage made the ensnarement.\n\n\"If there had been 30 people standing there, staring at the trap, (the capybara) would never have gone in.\"\n\nFor now, the cat-and-mouse saga continues. Price said more than 20 staffers are stationed across High Park every day, performing their regular duties and watching, hopefully, for any flicker of fur in the distance. The public is also encouraged to stay vigilant.\n\n\"When you're working with an animal, it's a dynamic environment,\" Lovatt said. \"You kind of have to see how things go as they go.\"\n\nPrice agreed, noting that the city has no projected or hopeful timeline for the second capture.\n\n\"You should probably ask the capybara that,\" she said."}

Whether it's because of increased early entrants or the systems college teams are running, more and more teams end up drafting players who can't be immediately useful.\n\nPanthers General Manager Dave Gettleman invoked former 49ers coach Bill Walsh saying he had a \"two-year rule\" to see if a player had a future with the team, but said it now has to be a three-year process.\n\n\"We're not getting instant oatmeal anymore,\" Gettleman said. \"And you've got to understand there's going to be growing pains. Nothing's easy. A guy can have all the talent in the world. But this game is about fundamentals and when we're getting them they don't have it. So our coaches have to really coach and teach, and it takes longer.\"\n\nGettleman illustrated his willingness to take the long view last year, drafting linebacker Shaq Thompson with the 25th pick, choosing a guy who might eventually replace Thomas Davis. Thompson started 10 games but played a fairly limited role for the Panthers this year (only 34.3 percent of their defensive snaps), as they try to get the college utility player ready to contribute more.\n\nAnd the guy Gettleman might have preferred to Thompson also illustrates that principle. The Panthers would have taken Florida offensive tackle D.J. Humphries, but the Cardinals chose him a pick before. Humphries wasn't ready to win a starting job out of training camp, and was inactive for all 16 games this season.\n\n\"We drafted D.J. last year knowing we were going to redshirt him because we had so much to teach him,\" Cardinals coach Bruce Arians said. \"If he threw him out there, he was going to fail. Once they fail, it's hard to get those scars off. He didn't dress a game purposefully just to get better and better.\"\n\nFor teams like the Panthers and Cardinals which have had success recently, it's easier to give a guy time to learn, since the staffs have a sense of security that allows development. Bad teams with coaches under pressure don't have the luxury. It also takes a roster talented enough that rookies aren't forced into situations they're not ready for."}

Some observers have speculated that a change in dates could lead various entities \u2014 including the countries that lost out on the bid to host the 2022 World Cup \u2014 to seek legal action.

The United States would not have that issue ( Major League Soccer 's season runs from spring to fall), but that does not mean there would not be conflicts with a switch to a tournament in November. In just one example, Fox and Telemundo bid about $1 billion to broadcast the World Cup in the United States in 2018 and 2022.

He must have felt at ease among friends because he spoke a bit too frankly.\n\nTicking off a list of recent accomplishments by the GOP-controlled Legislature, he mentioned the new law forcing voters to show a photo ID at the polls. Said Turzai, with more than a hint of triumph: \"Voter ID, which is gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania \u2014 done.\"\n\nThat's not even slightly ambiguous. The Democratic presidential candidate has won Pennsylvania in every election since 1992. But now the top Republican in the Pennsylvania House is boasting that, because of the new voter ID law, Mitt Romney will defy history and capture the state's 20 electoral votes in November.\n\nWhy on earth would Turzai imagine such a result? After all, the law applies to all voters, regardless of party affiliation. It is ostensibly meant only to safeguard the electoral process and eliminate fraud. Why would a neutral law have such partisan impact?\n\nThanks to figures released last week by state officials, we know the answer. It turns out that 758,939 registered Pennsylvania voters do not have the most easily obtained and widely used photo ID, a state driver's license. That's an incredible 9.2 percent of the registered electorate.\n\nMost of the voters without driver's licenses live in urban areas \u2014 which just happen to be places where poor people and minorities tend to live. More than 185,000 of these voters without licenses, about one-fourth of the total, live in Philadelphia \u2014 which just happens to be a Democratic stronghold where African Americans are a plurality.\n\nCould suppressing the urban minority vote really give Pennsylvania to Romney? It probably wouldn't have made a difference in 2008, when Obama trounced John McCain handily. But the statewide contest is often much closer \u2014 and turnout in Philadelphia typically is key to a Democratic candidate's prospects. In 2004, for example, John Kerry's margin over George W. Bush in the state was a mere 144,248.\n\nPerhaps these numbers are so intoxicating that Turzai forgot the cover story about how voter ID is supposed to protect the franchise rather than selectively restrict it. His spokesman later explained that Turzai meant \"the Republican presidential candidate will be on a more even keel thanks to voter ID\" \u2014 in other words, there will be a level playing field once the new law eliminates all that pesky voter fraud.\n\nThat might be reasonable, except for one fact: There's no fraud to eliminate.\n\nProdded by GOP political activists, the Justice Department under Bush conducted an extensive, nationwide, five-year probe of voter fraud \u2014 and ended up convicting a grand total of 86 individuals, according to a 2007 New York Times report. Most of the cases involved felons or immigrants who may not have known they were ineligible to vote.\n\nNot one case involved the only kind of fraud that voter ID could theoretically prevent: impersonation of a registered voter by someone else. Pennsylvania and other voter ID states have, in essence, passed laws that will be highly effective in eradicating unicorns.\n\nThe Pennsylvania law and others like it are under attack in the courts; this week, a federal three-judge panel in Washington is hearing arguments on Texas's year-old law, with a ruling expected next month. Meanwhile, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a conservative Republican, broke with orthodoxy last week and vetoed bills that would have toughened an existing voter ID statute. Maybe the tide is turning. If it doesn't, these laws will potentially disenfranchise or discourage millions of qualified voters.\n\nIn a previous column, I wrote that voter ID was a solution in search of a problem. I was wrong: The problem seems to be that too many of the wrong kind of voters \u2014 low-income, urban, African American, Hispanic \u2014 are showing up at the polls. Republican candidates have been vowing to \"take back\" the country. Now we know how.\n\neugenerobinson@washpost.com"}

Paul Ryan, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty. In a statement issued Friday night, the Romney campaign said the running mate would be revealed at 9 a.m. EDT at the Nauticus Museum. Romney is kicking off a four-day bus tour through swing states.\n\nA source tells CBS News that Romney called Portman to say he wouldn't be vice president. Portman will be participating in a bike ride in Ohio Saturday, as planned, to raise money for cancer research.\n\nSpeculation has focused in recent days on Ryan, the seven-term congressman. Conservative pundits have been urging Romney to choose Ryan in large part because of his authorship of a House-backed budget plan that seeks to curb overall entitlement spending and changes Medicaid into a voucher-like system to save costs.\n\nPawlenty was maintaining his Saturday schedule campaigning for Romney in New Hampshire, an official close to Pawlenty's political team said. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak ahead of the formal announcement.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, in an editorial on Thursday, praised Ryan as a strong choice for Romney: \"The case for Mr. Ryan is that he best exemplifies the nature and stakes of this election. More than any other politician, the House budget chairman has defined those stakes well as a generational choice about the role of government and whether America will once again become a growth economy or sink into interest-group dominated decline.\"\n\nRomney's choice comes as he tries to repair an image damaged by negative Democratic advertising and shift the trajectory of a campaign that's seen him lose ground to President Barack Obama.\n\nThe vice presidential selection will dominate headlines, and Romney's team has been relentlessly teasing the announcement for weeks.\n\nRomney's bus tour was expected to include appearances with Portman, as well as two others talked about as possible contenders for running mate: Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nThe tour starts Saturday and will take Romney through four must-win states in as many days: North Carolina, Virginia, Florida and Ohio. All are battlegrounds where Obama won in 2008. While Obama could afford to lose in one or more of them and still reach the 270 electoral votes needed for another term, Romney almost certainly needs all four to beat him."}

{"id": 191, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Currently the labeling of rivers is a bit of kludge (i.e., a complete kludge) that happens separately before all the other labeling.\u00a0 The algorithm looks along the river for a spot long enough to accommodate the label and not too curvy.\u00a0 If there's a city or another river joining this river, the algorithm skips over that obstruction and starts looking again.\u00a0 If it eventually finds a suitable spot, it makes a copy of the river (path) where it wants to place the label, relaxes the copied path (so it's less curvy than the river) and then writes the label along that path with an offset so that it isn't directly on top of the river.\u00a0 Somewhere in there it also has to figure out whether to flip the label so that it doesn't end up reading left-to-right.\u00a0 (In the above map, you can see that \"R. Geheyusckuta\" has been flipped.) Generally speaking, this works fairly well but has some drawbacks.\u00a0 The algorithm is conservative, so when it places a river label it usually looks okay, but it means a lot of rivers go unlabeled.\u00a0 And since river labels are placed before all other labels and treated as obstacles, they sometimes prevent good placement of other labels.\u00a0 Finally, the algorithm is specific to rivers, and doesn't work for labeling other paths.\u00a0 For these reasons, I'd like to build general path labels into the simulated annealing algorithm, and let them get positioned in concert with all the other labels.\u00a0 Much of what I have written for the existing river labels algorithm will still be applicable.\u00a0 The simulated annealing will find a location for the label, but the rest of displaying the label on the map will be very similar to the current algorithm.\u00a0 (I hope!) To add path labels to the simulated annealing algorithm I need two elements: (1) a way to find new candidate locations, and (2) the criteria for judging how good a location would be for the label. A candidate location for a path label starts by selecting a location on the path.\u00a0 Just to get the code going, I started by selecting the start of the river and anchoring the labels there.\n(I've turned off the forests to make the labels more visible.)\u00a0 That seems to be working, so now I'll extend that to anchor the label at a random point along the length of the river, like this:\nThis is actually a little harder to do than you might imagine, because I have the path as a series of line segments. \u00a0So picking a random point along there involves something like picking a random line segment -- weighted by the length of the segment -- and then picking a random point within the segment. \u00a0Fortunately, there turns out to be an easier approach. Since I've drawn the path, I can make use of some of the browser-provided methods for dealing with SVG paths. \u00a0It turns out that the browser provides a method for measuring down the length of a path and finding the screen point at that location.\u00a0 So I can generate a candidate point by generating a random number between 0 and the length of the path and then using the SVG method to find the point at that distance.\u00a0 This point represents the start of the label.\u00a0 Here's what it looks like to generate random start points this way and anchor the labels there:\nSo now I have a method that can generate a new candidate position for the start of the label somewhere along the river. \u00a0However, recall that in simulated annealing there's a \"temperature\" that drops as the algorithm progresses. \u00a0As the temperature drops, new candidate positions should jump around less -- that is, they should progressively be restricted to being closer and closer to the current position. \u00a0I accommodate this by picking points in a window around the current position, rather than randomly along the whole length of the river.\u00a0 As the temperature drops, I make the window smaller and smaller. In the picture above, the labels are horizontal like the city and area labels. \u00a0But for path labels, I don't want them to be horizontal, but to follow the path.\u00a0 To get started implementing that, I need the point on the path where the label would end if it was lying along the path.\u00a0 In other words, if the label has a length 'l', I now want to look along the path until I find a point that is at least 'l' distance away from the start point:\nThe closest this point can be (if the path in-between is a straight line) is an additional distance \"l\" down the path.\u00a0 If the path is not perfectly straight, then it's actually further along the path.\u00a0 In that case, I step along the path in small increments until I hit the first point that is \"l\" or further away from the start point.

The castaways were divided into two tribes: Galang, comprised of returning players, and Tadhana, the returning players' loved ones. John's wife Candice was booted from Galang in an immediate vote-off and sent to Redemption Island. Despite this initial setback, John quickly got himself into the majority on Tadhana as part of Brad's all guys alliance. John trusted Brad, even going so far as to share idol clues with him, but as Tadhana continued to lose, Brad became paranoid that Candice would return to the game and take John away from him. Brad's paranoia led to him blindsiding John and sending him to Redemption Island; this move saw the end of the all guys alliance when at the next tribal council the tribe voted out Brad. Both John and Brad eventually lost at Redemption Island, leaving the game pre-merge.\n\nInside Survivor reached out to John to get his thoughts on Brad's return to Survivor: Game Changers.\n\nDisclaimer: This interview was conducted in June 2016 while Survivor: Game Changers was still filming in Fiji.\n\n1) Hey John, thanks for doing this. In Blood vs. Water, it was presented on TV as if Brad was in control of those first few votes. Was that true? If so, how did he gain such control?\n\nBrad was definitely in control for the first vote, since he quickly went around and got all the guys together. Everyone was on board with not being the first to go home, so we let it ride. He definitely was less in control the second vote. At that point, Vytas Baskauskas really took over until the swap in my opinion.\n\n2) He came across to viewers as a bold, in-your-face type character. What was he like to live with day-to-day? Big personality all the time? Or did he have a chill side too?\n\nBrad is a very entertaining guy. He's very much a \"talk first, think later\" kind of guy which is great for entertainment purposes. He had a ton of stories and jokes and was generally well liked. That's not to say that his personality isn't off-putting to some people. He would definitely fill the air if it were vacant, which means a lot coming from a loud, talkative guy like me, and I think that bothered some people. So I guess he's a big personality all the time. Even his \"chill\" side is intense and high energy.\n\n3) Brad seemed to be all about the \"bro down\" in Blood vs. Water. What was his relationship like with the women on the tribe?\n\nI don't know what most of the women (except Marissa Peterson) thought on the whole about Brad, but he didn't make much of an effort at all to include them in strategy. I do know that a few people felt like he talked \"at\" them a lot and not \"with\" them.\n\n4) Brad blindsided you because he didn't trust that you'd stay loyal to him at the merge. Was Brad right to make that move? What was your plan moving forward?\n\nNo, it was an idiotic move! We've talked about it since, and he agrees, but always defends it in the context of worrying about his wife, Monica. Ultimately it led to his downfall. Before I was voted out by Brad and Vytas, we hadn't talked about breaking up the five guys alliance at all. His concern was that if Candice came back in (which she very likely would have), that she would not want to work with Brad and Monica. That is probably true, but that was many many moves ahead. He had no idea if Monica would even make it that far. He made a move that fractured our alliance and made people not trust each other, and basically helped keep the tribe weaker and going to tribal council over and over again.\n\nAt the end of the day, at a really early time point, he turned on the one person who said they would look out for him because I needed people like him around to keep the target off of me. It didn't work out for either of us. I would have kept working with Brad and even Monica if it suited my gameplay, but if I had the opportunity to vote Monica out, I absolutely would have done it after she voted for Candice. The family dynamic was pretty suffocating in our season from a gameplay perspective.\n\n5) What is Brad's most positive attribute and his most negative attribute?\n\nBrad is a likable guy, very good at challenges, and really helpful around camp. Honestly, if he can lay low, he probably can do really well and make it far. He's"}
{"id": 194, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "So you bought hair products with the word \"curl\" on the bottles and watched a few tutorials by a YouTuber who has your dream curls, but for some reason your hair still isn't coming out the way you want it to. Let's take a step back: Do you have the same curl pattern as the person whose curls you're envying? If not, you may be setting your curls up to fail.\n\nIf you are new to the world of natural curls, getting to know your curl pattern can help you discover styling techniques and products that will work for you. You'll also be able to more easily find the videos that'll be most relevant to you.\n\nRelated: What's Your Hair Type? Take The Quiz\n\nWhat's a curl pattern?\n\nAt NaturallyCurly, we find it useful to divide curl patterns into three main groups: wavy, curly, and coily. We know \"curly\" means a lot of things to a lot of people, and we wince when we see comments on social media saying \"Those aren't real curls; those are just waves!\" We have no tolerance for comments that insinuate that one curl pattern is better or worse than another. It goes without saying, but we'll say it anyway: We want women of all curl patterns to love and embrace their hair. This texture-typing system is not meant to be divisive, but to provide guidance that will help you care for, style, and LOVE your mane.\n\nWhere to start\n\nThe best time to identify your curl pattern is when your hair is at its healthiest state; this means moisturized and free of damage. If you have been straightening your hair for the past few years or even months, you may have heat damage. To get a clear idea of your natural curl pattern, it's best to look at it once you have stopped using heat tools \u2014 including blow dryers, flat irons, and curling wands \u2014 for at least three months. If the roots are curlier than the ends of your hair, then this is a clear indicator of heat damage, and figuring out your curl pattern may be a struggle until your natural curls grow in and the damaged ends have been cut off.\n\nIf you have curl patterns that are drastically different from each other, you may want to treat those sections of your hair differently\n\nRemember, most people are a mix of a couple of curl patterns. As you can see in the graphic above, we included examples of someone who could be considered Type 2c/3a, and someone who fits in between Types 3c and 4a. If you feel you fit multiple curl patterns, that is totally normal. If you have curl patterns that are drastically different from each other, you may want to treat those sections of your hair differently (for example, using heavier products in one section) or some use perm rods to create a uniform curl pattern. Finding an experienced stylist who knows how to work with curls can also help customize your haircut to accommodate your multiple curl patterns (so one section doesn't look longer than another).\n\nBelow, find descriptions for the three most common types of curly hair. Within each of the categories, there are more subtle distinctions; read on to determine which one fits you best.\n\nWavy Hair\n\nWavy hair is characterized by S-shaped waves (rather than coils). Women with wavy hair typically use mousses, leave-in serums, and heat protectants rather than creams or gels, and are generally most concerned with reducing their frizz and finding products that will give their waves light hold without weighing them down. Those with wavy hair are less likely to avoid certain ingredients like silicones and sulfates, and more likely to use heat-styling tools like flat irons or curling wands. Think Taylor Swift (back before she straightened her hair) and Lorde.\n\nIf your hair is close to straight but has a loose, gentle bend, you likely have Type 2a waves. If your hair is mostly straight at the roots and more defined waves form below your eye level, your waves are Type 2b. If your waves start right at the roots and you have very defined waves mixed with actual ringlets, then you are Type 2c.\n\nCurly Hair\n\nType 3 hair has more defined, springy curls that form spirals or ringlets. Those with Type 3 hair are mostly concerned with reducing frizz and adding definition. They use creams and gels to give their curls definition, and they're more likely to avoid drying ingredients in their shampoos.\n\nIf your curls are similar in size to the large sidewalk chalk you used as a kid, then you're Type 3a.

Bush.\n\n\nFrom The Seattle Times:\n\nA federal judge in Seattle has ordered a halt to enforcement of President Trump's controversial travel ban on citizens from seven predominantly Muslim nations.\n\n\nU.S. District Judge James Robart ruled in favor Friday of Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who sued to invalidate key provisions of Trump's executive order. That order indefinitely blocks entry to the United States for Syrian refugees and temporarily suspends entry to citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries.\n\n\nThe temporary restraining order is granted on a nationwide basis, Robart said.\n\n\n...In his oral ruling, Robart said Washington had standing to bring the case forward and provided evidence that Trump's order has immediate harm. And the lawsuit, the judge said, has substantial likelihood of success in its underlying challenge to the constitutionality of the order.\n\n\n...In a legal filing asking for the restraining order, Ferguson argued Trump's travel ban targets Muslims, violating the constitutional rights of immigrants and their families.\n\n\n\"Federal courts have no more sacred role than protecting marginalized groups against irrational, discriminatory conduct,\" reads the filing by Ferguson, state Solicitor General Noah Purcell and Colleen Melody, head of the attorney general's civil-rights unit. FDR literally threw Japanese people in internment camps and that was ruled legal. There's a reason no other judge entertained this garbage. But in a response brief filed late Thursday, attorneys for the Trump administration said Washington state lacked standing to bring the challenge, and that the president has properly exercised his broad, border-security powers to protect Americans.\n\n\n\"Every President over the last thirty years has invoked this authority to suspend or impose restrictions on the entry of certain aliens or classes of aliens, in some instances including classifications based on nationality,\" reads the administration brief, submitted by Chad Readler, acting assistant U.S. attorney general, and other Justice Department lawyers.\n\n\nThe administration brief also cited previous court rulings that say there is no constitutional right of entry to the U.S. for foreign nationals. I'm surprised Robart didn't throw out a black power fist and scream \"Muslim lives matter.\"\n\n\nThis incident from a few months ago should give you an idea of the type of intellect we're dealing with here.\n\n\nFrom The Daily Caller:\n\nA federal judge in Washington state declared \"black lives matter\" during a hearing Monday.\n\n\nU.S. District Judge James Robart, a former President George W. Bush appointee, is presiding over the implementation of a 2012 consent decree requiring Seattle to adopt various police reforms. The city's police department was accused by the federal government of engaging in various practices, such as excessive force, that fell disproportionately on non-white residents and therefore violated their civil rights. The consent decree was reached so the city could avoid fighting a costly lawsuit against the feds.\n\n\nThis is the first time the contentious political movement has had its anthem officially supported by a judge in a federal courtroom.\n\n\nImplementing that consent decree is requiring extensive negotiations with Seattle's police union, because some of the reforms it prescribes would modify their current contract. For instance, putting internal investigations in the hands of civilians, rather than police officers. Most recently, the union voted to reject a contract that would have implemented certain reforms while giving officers a small pay boost.\n\n\nIn a Monday hearing, Robart lashed out at the union for holding up the reform process.\n\n\n\"The court and the citizens of Seattle will not be held hostage for increased payments and benefits,\" he said from the bench. \"I'm sure the entire city of Seattle would march behind me.\"\n\n\nThen, Robart stunned the courtroom by explicitly tying the proceedings to the Black Lives Matter movement. According to The Seattle Times, he cited statistics that blacks represent 41 percent of all people shot by police, when they are just 20 percent of the population. This is a mistake on Robart's part; blacks are actually just 13 percent of the population.\n\n\n\"Black lives matter,\" Robart said to end his remarks, in a moment that apparently produced audible shock from the courtroom. Black Lives Matter has been active for three years as a movement, but this appears to be the first time it has garnered such explicit support in court from a federal judge.

And sometimes it has had serious repercussions for real people and businesses.\n\nThat's what happened to a pizzeria in Washington, D.C., recently, when an armed man claiming to be \"self-investigating\" a fake news story entered the restaurant and fired off several rounds.\n\nBut once a fake news story is out there, and the harm has been done, what can a person do about it?\n\nDerigan Silver, a professor of media, First Amendment and Internet law at the University of Denver, tells NPR's Audie Cornish that victims of fake news stories have legal recourse under defamation law.\n\n\"Fake news sites are clearly a situation where they're engaging in a defamatory statement, a false statement about another that damages that person's reputation,\" Silver says. \"In that situation, that is certainly actionable.\"\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn the legal recourse for victims of fake news stories\n\nSo in most of these situations, the person that has been harmed is going to bring a lawsuit that we call a tort. Now a tort is a noncontractual harm between two private individuals. It's a civil lawsuit, where you're alleging that one person harmed another. ...\n\nSo anytime one private individual harms another private individual, you can bring a lawsuit for a tort. So one of those torts that people can have advantage of is called defamation. Defamation is a tort that alleges that a communication damaged your reputation.\n\nOn who's accountable for fake news stories\n\nThey can hold accountable anybody who has communicated the defamatory statement to anybody else. That includes the person who originated the defamatory statement, but under something called the republication rule, it also includes anybody who repeated the defamatory statement. Now simply retweeting a defamatory statement is probably not going to be enough to qualify for republication, but passing on information that you heard from somebody else certainly is republication.\n\nSo you have some cases coming out of Texas, for example, where hundreds and hundreds of people were adding to a posting that had more and more and more defamatory contents. And if you can track those people down, if you can find out those identities, then yes, you can sue every single person who sort of adds to that defamatory statement or repeats that defamatory statement.\n\nU.S. Comet Ping Pong Owner James Alefantis On Conspiracy Theory Ordeal Fake News Surge Pins D.C. Pizzeria As Home To Child-Trafficking Listen \u00b7 3:55 3:55\n\nOn the challenges of filing defamation lawsuits\n\nThat's one of the problems with defamation law is once the information is out there, is monetary damages really what they want to recover? And should they have to be able to pay lawyers [$400], $500 an hour in order to recover their good name from a story that is clearly made up and clearly fictitious and clearly has no basis in reality at all?\n\nOn the current debate over defamation laws\n\nI think that fake news really has kind of all set us back a little bit. One of the ideas behind the First Amendment is that we believe in something called the marketplace of ideas: that if you let \"truthhood\" and falsity battle in the marketplace of ideas, that truth will eventually win, that we have an assumption that people are rational, and they can determine truth from falsity.\n\nAnd that's kind of making us rethink these kind of basic premises behind freedom of expression. Are we in a situation now where truth no longer matters, and people are not able to sort these things out?\n\nOther people say, you know, the idea that truth is always going to win is idle sentimentality. The reason we have freedom of expression is not because truth will always win, but because without freedom of expression, truth has no chance of winning whatsoever.\n\nAnd so this has been a really challenging election for a lot of people who believe in free speech, and media law has actually come up a lot in this election, and it's something that a lot of us are thinking deeply about."}

{"id": 209, "ended": true, "length": 996, "text": "Did South African higher education have a hand in our resurgent student voice? Absolutely, student activists would argue, but for its lack of transformation serving as an obstacle rather than an ally in the project of change. Campus debates on change relate not only to transformation but also to how prominent and capable student voices feature in struggles for institutional identity, values and curriculum. Much more than Mcebo Dlamini's Hitler comments, it is the exciting commentaries on higher education change in campaigns such as #RhodesMustFall, #TransformWits and #OpenStellies that demand higher education examine its engagement of student provocateurs.\n\nOn the back foot\n\nDespite their authentic attempts to expedite change, more often than not universities seem to be on the back foot when students disrupt established lines of thought and practice \u2014 a stance that would not be worrying if South African students could claim a well-established and accomplished position as co-creators of knowledge in the classroom and as co-authors of institutional transformation. A poo-protest to disrupt colonial history surely would read different when a university community already are engaged in difficult dialogues and openly debate difficult decisions on institutional change, as also would protesters chained to Paul Kruger's statue to protect their heritage.\n\nOne problem key to students' distrust of higher education transformation is that of a silent vanguard \u2014 the silent voice of the student affairs' division in the higher education debate. As a penultimate institutional environment that concerns itself with the holistic wellness and development of students, the student affairs' office offers campus communities access to and sites for talking and listening to students. There, in the residence hall, on the sport field, at the theatre or the freshers' ball, across the forum table, on social media and in counselling sessions, student affairs practitioners hear, see and discover the hearts and minds of students \u2014 the full range of social spaces that students live with are its concern, and its classroom.\n\nStudent affairs as vanguard\n\nFor this reason, as students offer a vanguard to society, student affairs could do so for higher education. At its best, student affairs as a vanguard contributes most to institutional debates when it facilitates a vibrant student voice in the authorship of an institutional narrative \u2013 the lived experience and sense of identity of a campus community, and its story then told. Student affairs must do what a vanguard should \u2013 move with next generation to discover new perspectives and translate its discoveries for a campus community that follows. Get it right and the university community knows what debates the next generation will point at, but get it wrong, and the vanguard is silent, or worse still, silenced, and the student voice left to a nervous condition.\n\nStudents become authors when they achieve that level of wellness and capability to critically reflect on their life narrative, identity and aspirations in relation to that of others and their society, and ethically act to change their environment and serve the common good. This project succeeds outside the classroom when student development and support combine well in daily student life \u2013 opportunities to develop activist skills and social support for quality of life are sides of the same coin in student affairs practice.\n\nTeaching under trees\n\nBut what many campuses misjudge is the complexity of this interface of learning and support \u2013 the landscape of curriculum logic and pedagogy as a major part of professional support and student development programmes. It is for instance a complex matter to mentor leaders, while also administrating the logistics of housing, but this is precisely what student affairs as a higher education vanguard must do. This is teaching in the mode of serving students holistically. This is teaching under trees, a way of life.\n\nWhile campuses value the vanguard voice of student affairs differently, often in worst cases limiting its contribution to operational planning and practice as support service environment, student affairs often are silent more than silenced. Silent, when student affairs environments do not appropriately engage the educational project required to facilitate authorship among students, or do not appropriately translate the student voice institutionally.\n\nStrong vanguard voice\n\nIts educational project for student authorship should consist of the curriculum design, pedagogical practice and assessment of student development programmes, such as for student leadership development, but also for student life and wellness programmes co-created by students and student affairs practitioners. Its translation project for student authorship should consist of institutional advocacy for depth and reach of student participation, establishment of safe spaces for challenging dialogue and facilitating a vibrant student initiative.\n\nIn vigorous pedagogy and unrelenting advocacy lies a strong vanguard voice.\n\nWhat recent student activism unmasks is the silence of our vanguard \u2013 silent not for its lack of an educational project, but for the hidden and hesitant position of its curriculum and pedagogy. What student affairs in South Africa now needs, is to make plain its vanguard pedagogy, its teaching under trees."}

I do not believe this to be the case! What you are seeing is the Reverse Speech phenomenon in action and it occurs in all forms of human speech. The deliberate \"backmasked\" section on Peter Gabriel's song is a common recording trick used by many artists for special effects. There is nothing sinister in this at all. To those people wanting to use this as an arguement, I say the same thing to you as I said to the fundamentalist christians when they went ballistic over reversed messages in rock and roll songs. Look at your own speech and publications before you jump to rapid judgement at others. You will find the same messages in your speech as you claim others are deliberately putting into theirs. Reverse Speech is everywhere \u2013 in the goodies as well as the baddies. It is a natural function of language, no more and no less. (DJO 4/2000)\n\nIn the middle of 1996, John Travolta's new movie Phenomenon was released. The movie was about a simple farmer who was hit by a strange beam of light from the sky. This gave him amazing new intelligence and unexplained powers.\n\nSince the movie's release, controversy has begun to arise concerning its real message and purpose. According to the Globe tabloid, which quotes two disc jockeys from Flint Michigan, Phenomenon is riddled with secret references to John Travolta's belief in Scientology. Click here to see a reprint of the Globe article.\n\nOne of the specific claims is that the movie's theme song, \"I have the touch\", sung by British rocker Peter Gabriel, contains hidden backward messages. The most obvious, according to Mitch Gill and Tommy Walker (the Michigan DJs) is the very clear phrase, \"Don't you miss Ron?\" This is supposedly a reference to Scientology's founder, the late Ron Hubbard. I spoke with Mitch and Tommy by phone and was curious enough to do some of my own research.\n\nAs charges of intentional backmasking were denied by Peter Gabriel's publicist, I initially assumed that the song contained the standard speech reversals that I have discovered occur in all music and speech. As these reversals are a natural function of the human mind, they appear in all songs and are, naturally, unplanned by the recording studio or artist. It seemed fairly logical to me that speech reversals would occur that supported Travolta's belief in Scientology. There seemed to be nothing too sinister in that.\n\nHowever, I was in for a shock when I finally obtained a copy for the album after being approached by the nationally syndicated TV program, \"Extra\", for my opinion on the controversy. The very first thing I noticed as I played the song forwards was an intentionally backmasked message right at the beginning of the album. Intentional backmasking is totally different from Reverse Speech. Reverse Speech naturally occurs in the human mind as an automatic function of language. Backmasking is a recording technique where the studio superimposes a soundtrack backwards over the forward soundtrack. It is easy to recognise. It sounds like gibberish when the track is played forwards and becomes an intelligible sentence when the track is played backwards.\n\nReverse Speech has no superimposed soundtrack and occurs solely by the way the words are sung or spoken at the time the recording is made.\n\nListen to the first example of a hidden message on this song. Notice that is sounds like gibberish forwards. When it is played backwards at three separate speeds, the words \"Don't you miss Ron?\" can be heard. It sounds a little strange because it has been hidden somewhat by echo effects. This is an example of an intentionally backmasked message (Backward Masking) at the recording studio level. I am somewhat surprised, therefore, that Peter Gabriel's publicist has denied putting this in because it is an obvious technical insertion. Maybe it was done in the recording studio after the song was made. Either way, there is nothing sinister in this. The message is meaningless.\n\nThe next thing I noticed as I listened to the soundtrack forwards is that there is also an example of a hidden subliminal message in the song. It is forwards, faint and fast, and occurs right at the very end of the soundtrack. It says: \"Ron Hubbard, Ron Ron Ron, Ron Hubbard make contact.\" It is unclear whether this was intentional or not.\n\nFinally I checked the soundtrack for Reverse Speech and my eyes really opened wide. I first found a very clear example"}

Today we will cover the advanced versions of weight training using pyramid routines \u2013 the Oxford Method and ascending rest-pause routine.\n\nFor some people, the Oxford Method is more of an intermediate pyramid routine. It is similar to reverse pyramid sets. You will use a really heavy weight for the first set and decrease as your muscles fatigue for each subsequent set. Your rep range will be dependent upon the type of training you want to do \u2013 low reps (4-6) for strength/power, average reps (8-12) for building mass and high reps (15-20) for endurance. To do the first set, choose a weight that you can JUST do 10 times and cannot do the 11th rep. For the next set, you will do the same thing except use a lower weight (usually 10% less than set 1). You should just complete 10 reps. For the third and final set, decrease the weight again and do 10 more reps. Depending on how aggressive you want to be, 2 sets may be enough or you may want to increase it to 4.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe most advanced form of Pyramid Routine is the ascending rest-pause. The intent is to workout with larger weights but to mix in rest periods to allow your muscles to recover partially before continuing. Choose a weight that you can do for 10 reps but only do 5. Rest for 5 seconds and then do 5 more reps. Rest another 5 seconds and do 5 more reps. That makes one set. Add 5-10 pounds of weight (your 9 rep max) and do the same process but for 4 reps and rest for 10 seconds. Continue to 3 reps with 5-10 more pounds and rest 15 seconds then to 2 reps with 5-10 more pounds. This last set is done to failure; keep doing 2 reps with rest breaks until you cannot do 2 reps. For example:\n\n\nUsing this method will generate a lot of muscle growth by stimulating your muscles at their peak exhaustion level.\n\nDid This Blog Help You?

Patty Murray is among the leading backers of a White House plan to expand overtime pay for nearly 5 million Americans.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With only 8 percent of salaried workers currently covered by overtime rules, Sen. Patty Murray says it's time for the federal government to intervene.\n\nAfter becoming the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in January, the senator from Washington state is among the leading backers of a White House plan to expand overtime pay for nearly 5 million Americans.\n\nIt could mean raises for 90,000 workers in her home state.\n\nMurray faces resistance from retailers who fear that higher pay would force them to cut jobs and reduce work hours. She counters that the overtime rules are outdated, doing little to help workers who are routinely assigned to longer hours.\n\n\"It would mean a lot of money in people's pockets, and what it basically means is you're going to get paid for the work that you do,\" Murray said in an interview Tuesday.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Murray said, 62 percent of the American workforce was covered by overtime rules, but that number has been in steady decline.\n\nUnder federal law, hourly employees are guaranteed overtime pay for working more than 40 hours per week, receiving at least 1\u00bd times their regular rate of pay. But the rules limit overtime pay for salaried workers to those who earn less than $23,660 per year. Under the White House plan announced earlier this month by President Obama, that threshold would more than double, to $50,440.\n\nMurray said she's confident that the new rule will take effect after the Department of Labor seeks comment on the proposal. Murray said the only way it can be blocked is if Congress intervenes. Even then, she said, Obama could use his veto power to prevail.\n\n\"This is something that is going to happen,\" Murray said.\n\nSo far, the proposal isn't causing much of a fuss in Washington state. The Washington Retail Association, based in Olympia, said it had not yet decided how to react, while Amazon, the Seattle-based Internet retail giant, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., it's a much different story.\n\nIn a statement, the National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail trade association, called the plan an attempt to \"build the middle class by government mandate.\"\n\n\"There simply isn't any magic pot of money that lets employers pay more just because the government says so,\" said David French, the group's senior vice president for government relations.\n\nAnd House Republicans, anticipating the White House move, called a hearing on the plan in June, nearly a month before Obama announced the proposed change.\n\n\"Rather than providing more opportunities for individuals to earn overtime pay, it appears that the new regulations will only result in a more complicated law, requiring outside legal advice for small businesses, and more litigation,\" said Jamie Richardson, White Castle's vice president of government and shareholder relations, testifying before the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.\n\nDespite the opposition, Murray said the plan will boost the economy by helping people spend more.\n\n\"If they get that additional money for working more, they're going to have more in their pockets to take their kids out for pizza or to buy them another pair of shoes for school or to perhaps save for their college,\" she said.\n\nThe issue is just one of many pro-labor plans on Murray's plate this year, after she replaced former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin as the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education and Pensions Committee. Murray called it a \"rewarding assignment.\"\n\nWhile she has gained much attention for overhauling the No Child Left Behind schools law, she has also used her new perch to promote a series of labor issues.\n\nAmong them:\n\n\u2022 She's the chief sponsor of the Raise the Wage Act, which would increase the federal minimum wage to $12 by 2020.\n\n\u2022 She's the lead Senate Democrat on The Healthy Families Act, which would require employers to provide up to seven paid sick days per year. It would apply to companies with more 15 employees.\n\n\u2022 She teamed up with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, to introduce a bill aimed at giving workers more predictability in their work schedules. It would require retail, food service and cleaning employees to receive work schedules at least two weeks in advance, or one hour's worth of extra pay for schedules changed with less than a 24-hour notice.\n\n\u2022 She has pushed to close the wage gap between men and women working the same jobs. And she released a report showing the challenges women face in retirement, with a poverty rate nearly double that of men among those 65 and older.\n\nFor Murray, a 64-year-old former preschool"}

Yet the smartwatch is dogged by a perception that seems premature given the history of Apple's most popular devices: disappointment.\n\nAs the Watch marks its first anniversary on Sunday\u2014two days before Apple's quarterly earnings announcement\u2014the product's fate is critical to the company. It is Apple's first all-new product since the iPad and a test of its ability to innovate under Chief Executive Tim Cook, when sales of iPhones are slowing.\n\n\u200bSo far, the numbers appear solid. Apple doesn't disclose sales, but analysts estimate about 12 million Watches were sold in year one. At an estimated average price of $500, that is a $6 billion business\u2014three times the annual revenue of activity tracker Fitbit Inc.\n\nBy comparison, Apple sold roughly six million iPhones in its first year. As a new entrant, the Watch accounted for about 61% of global smartwatch sales last year, according to researcher IDC.\n\nAnd yet, there are detractors such as Fred Wilson, co-founder of venture-capital firm Union Square Ventures, in December declared the Watch a \"flop.\" Mr. Wilson, who owns shares of Fitbit through a fund, had earlier predicted the Watch wouldn't be a \"home run\" like the iPad, iPhone and iPod, saying many people wouldn't want to wear a computer on their wrist.\n\nThe Watch has shortcomings. It is slow, with an underpowered processor that is throttled at times to extend the device's battery life. It lacks mobile and Global Positioning System connections, meaning it must be accompanied by an iPhone, limiting its usefulness as an independent device. The battery needs to be charged every day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge is the Watch's lack of a defining purpose. It does certain things well, such as activity tracking, mobile payments and notifications. But there is no task the Apple Watch handles that can't be done by an iPhone or a less-expensive activity tracker.\n\nJoshua Stein, a 33-year-old app developer in Chicago, said he bought a Watch shortly after its release, but found the software slow and thought it was inconvenient having to charge it each night. In January, he sold the Watch on eBay and returned to using a $150 Pebble smartwatch with a longer-lasting battery.\n\n\"Basically, I didn't use it that much,\" said Mr. Stein. \"The functionality of the Watch is still pretty limited.\"\n\nThere are relatively easy fixes for some concerns. Apple is working on adding cell-network connectivity and a faster processor to its next-generation Watch, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \u200b\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther problems run deeper. Forrester Research analyst J.P. Gownder says the Watch isn't useful enough. He expected more businesses to create apps like one from Starwood Hotel & Resorts Worldwide Inc. that lets customers check in, receive a room assignment and unlock a room door without stopping at the front desk.\n\nMr. Gownder said Apple hadn't done enough to build a broader ecosystem of services. \"Apple needs to make it an indispensable thing,\" he said.\n\nStill, the Apple Watch has fans who use it daily. According to research firm Wristly, 93% of 1,150 Apple Watch owners in an online survey last week said they were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with the device.\n\nIn a sign of how users are personalizing their watches, Apple said in March that a third of users regularly change the bands for the Watch to match their outfits or occasion. \"It's become a part of my day,\" said Dana Strom, a 31-year-old video editor from Santa Monica, Calif., who received the Watch as a gift from his wife in November. \"I miss it when I don't have it.\"\n\nHe finds notifications and turn-by-turn directions useful, though he grows frustrated at times at how slowly third-party apps run on the Watch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Watch's early struggles in some ways echo the iPhone, now considered a groundbreaking product that accounts for two-thirds of Apple's revenue.\n\nThe initial model didn't run on the then-fastest wireless network, didn't offer third-party apps and lacked basic functions such as copying and pasting text.\n\nAs it did with the initial iPhone, Apple in March cut the price for the least-expensive version of the smaller-size Sport Watch model by $50 to $299.\n\nToni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, estimates Apple has sold 12 million Apple Watches in the first year at an average sales price of $500. Similarly, Neil Cybart, who runs Above Avalon, a site dedicated to analysis of Apple, estimates Apple sold 13 million watches at an average price of $450.\n\nAdam"}

Bruce Goddard, Place Projects\n\n\"Over the GFC there was almost no construction \u2014 we had no construction for three or four years,\" he said.\n\n\"So there's been a bit of catch up after the financial crisis, and it's that catch up that is showing high volumes now,\" he said.\n\nHe said most major residential buildings were going up in West End, South Brisbane, Fortitude Valley and Teneriffe, with young renters increasingly looking to live close to work.\n\nBut he said the demand was being strongly driven by high property prices in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\n\"Brisbane is approximately 50 per cent cheaper than Sydney and 35 to 40 per cent cheaper than Melbourne,\" he said.\n\n\"International interest is growing reasonably rapidly, but I think we're seeing a lot of Melbourne and Sydney buyers because Melbourne and Sydney are so dear.\n\n\"We track the differences in values between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, and the difference is now at a record high.\"\n\nMixed reports over possible oversupply in Brisbane\n\nDespite a record number of major residential buildings going up in the city, Mr Goddard said Brisbane was not at risk of having an oversupply of apartments any time soon.\n\n\"An oversupply means that there are buildings being built, for which there are no tenants,\" he said.\n\n\"We are nowhere near that at the moment. As the buildings are being built, there are tenants, so there is good tenant demand, and the tenant demand is driving the buyer demand.\"\n\nBut Dr Bryant said she believed Brisbane was nearing its saturation point.\n\n\"As an industry we need to keep an eye on when the market gets to the saturation point, and I would predict that we are getting very close to point,\" she said.\n\n\"There's probably not enough demand to absorb all the supply that is proposed to come onto the market.\n\n\"If we meet saturation point, which is when demand sort of equals supply, then hopefully market forces would delay further apartments coming on the market.\n\n\"It is really important for the general economy that the property industry remain buoyant.\"\n\nTopics: building-and-construction, business-economics-and-finance, brisbane-4000, qld, australia"}

It was love at first brew. However, the brewing process left much to be desired. It was a ungainly process involving ugly plastic fermenters, a messy kitchen and thoroughly disgruntled roommates. I figured there had to be a better way to brew, one that would look at home in any environment and celebrate the process rather than hide it. In January 2013 I designed the first HopBox homebrewing kit. It was everything I wanted a brewing kit to be: stylish, portable, and accessible. I wanted to inspire people to brew, to experiment with new recipes, to feel the satisfaction that comes with sharing something you have made with family and friends. I also realized I wanted to make it more than a hobby - I wanted to make it my career. So I went all in! I quit my day job, emptied my accounts, and started living out my dream - one that I hope you share"}

Yet only a few people from the vast population of users are professional mathematicians, who create, teach, foster, and apply it in a variety of situations. The authors of this book believe that it should be possible for these professional mathematicians to explain to non-professionals what they do, what they say they are doing, and why the world should support them at it. They also believe that mathematics should be taught to non-mathematics majors in such a way as to instill an appreciation of the power and beauty of mathematics. Many people from around the world have told the authors that they have done precisely that with the first edition and they have encouraged publication of this revised edition complete with exercises for helping students to demonstrate their understanding. This edition of the book should find a new generation of general readers and students who would like to know what mathematics is all about. It will prove invaluable as a course text for a general mathematics appreciation course, one in which the student can combine an appreciation for the esthetics with some satisfying and revealing applications.\n\nThe text is ideal for 1) a GE course for Liberal Arts students 2) a Capstone course for perspective teachers 3) a writing course for mathematics teachers.\n\nThe Companion Guide to the Mathematical Experience 120 pp. * Softcover * $14.95 * ISBN 0-8176-3849-0"}

But the process of manufacturing the substance has been unpopular among residents of Irwindale, California, a small town of about 1,400 just twenty miles outside of Los Angeles. And where Irwindale smells a spicy controversy, Texas cities smell spicy opportunity.\n\nSriracha hasn't always been based in Irwindale\u2014the company relocated to the city in 2010, after being offered a sweetheart deal to build a $40 million factory. As the Los Angeles Times reported in November:\n\nHuy Fong Foods decided to locate its factory in Irwindale three years ago when the city offered a loan with \"irresistable\" terms: pay only interest for 10 years, with a balloon payment at the end. Huy Fong took the loan and contributed $250,000 a year to the city of Irwindale each year as part of the deal, Tran said. The company then built a $40-million factory that at full capacity could generate about $300 million a year in sales, according to Tran's statements.\n\nThe problems started not long after the factory was built. It turns out that the manufacturing process on a spicy sauce (that enjoys what the Times hilariously refers to as \"rock star status among condiments\"\u2014you're always on the outside looking in, mayonnaise) isn't the most pleasant thing to spend your days around. Reports soon came in about the not-unserious health problems that appeared to be popping up among local residents.\n\nThe city filed for a lawsuit against the facility to shut down the manufacturing after reports of \"burned eyes, inflamed asthma,\" and an entire birthday party being forced to flee indoors \"after the spicy smell descended on the festivities.\" That sounds like a joke, but in late November, a judge granted a partial injunction.\n\nShortly after the lawsuit against Sriracha manufacturer was filed, Denton city councilman Kevin Roden made a public bid to invite Huy Fong to relocate the facility to his fair North Texas college town.\n\nThe story continued to develop in recent weeks; Irwindale City Council backed down from its aggressive stance on the substance, voting to delay a decision on whether to declare the factory a public nuisance. And, over here in Texas, San Antonio threw its hat in the \"we'd like to host the Sriracha factory\" ring.\n\nMario Hernandez, president of San Antonio Economic Development Foundation, said the organization reached out two months ago to Tran, who indicated an expansion is more likely than a full-fledged relocation to the Alamo City, which would cost millions. \"We would welcome the opportunity on a complete relocation, but a more likely scenario is future expansion,\" Hernandez said. San Antonio is an ideal location for production of the spicy condiment because it is close to the Rio Grande Valley, a region with a large agriculture industry that could easily grow chilies for the product, Villalba said. Because the chilies must be transported to a factory for production soon after being harvested, San Antonio, the largest city in South Texas, logistically would be a prime location for a manufacturing plant.\n\nThe excitement over the opportunity to host the Sriracha factory is all very charming. It's delicious! Texans love hot sauce! But also, the reason that the Sriracha factory is talking relocation is that the current host city is arguing in court that it lowered the quality of life so dramatically that it would rather lose 200 jobs and the tax benefits of hosting a factory that generates $300 million worth of revenue than continue to deal with the asthma/nosebleeds/sinus irritation/canceled birthday parties.\n\nAll of which suggests that, jobs and tax dollars or no jobs and tax dollars, the eagerness to take this on is a bit weird. It may be, as both Denton and San Antonio officials singing the Sriracha song claim, that those issues that caused such headaches (or nosebleeds) in Irwindale wouldn't affect Denton (\"According to Roden, Denton's industrial sites are located 'far away' from residential neighborhoods, so Huy Fong won't need to worry about future lawsuits,\" our own Joseph Misulonas explained back in November) or San Antonio (\"Hernandez and Villalba said they have no reservations about the fumes emitted from the factory because proper steps would be taken to ensure safety of nearby residents,\" reports MySA.com).\n\nIt's nice that the cities have thought about it, but it's strange to assume that officials in Irwindale didn't consider any of that when they made their bid to host the factory in recent years. It's possible, of course, that San Antonio and Denton would experience nothing more than an expanded tax base and a boost in jobs if they were to take on the task of hosting the Sr"}

Evan Vucci/AP Photo It's not an exaggeration to say that Elon Musk and Donald Trump have the most diametric brains on the planet.\n\nThey also differ widely in their views on a hot-button political issue: climate change. The Tesla CEO is the world's most prominent proponent of using innovation to do something about global warming, while the president-elect has said climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.\n\nBut with the opening on Wednesday of Tesla's battery manufacturing factory in Nevada, Musk has suddenly wound up with a \"surprising alignment of interests with the new presidential administration,\" says Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's lead auto analyst.\n\nJonas, one of the most strident Tesla bulls on Wall Street, made the comment in a research note in which he assessed the Gigafactory's opening and reiterated his view that the company's Model 3 mass-market vehicle won't launch on schedule at the end of 2017.\n\nBut the alignment \"really seemed to sneak up on people,\" he added.\n\nOf course it did \u2014 until you think about where the two line up. Tesla's a high-tech domestic hiring machine.\n\nHere's Jonas, writing about the Nevada plant:\n\n\"As the bus drove up to the massive plant yesterday morning, one could not help but notice the hundreds of cars in the parking lot from the construction crew (yes, roughly 1/2 of the vehicles were pickup trucks), part of 2,100 construction workers running two shifts per day.\n\n\"To the extent that the creation of high-tech manufacturing jobs in the United States is a priority of the incoming administration, we believe Mr. Musk might have some interests that could be very much in alignment with those of President-elect Trump.\"\n\nOld versus new manufacturing\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the Obama administration was also supportive of high-tech manufacturing and that it's unclear whether all US manufacturing jobs are equal in the eyes of Trump and the GOP. And don't forget that constructing Tesla's Nevada Gigafactory involved old-school labor, while the manufacturing of battery cells inside could eventually be almost completely automated.\n\nBut Jonas is onto something by highlighting what could be an unexpected and potentially awkward shared interest of Trump and Musk. The Tesla CEO did, after all, make the pilgrimage to Trump Tower along with the rest of the Silicon Valley tech elite.\n\nHowever, all of Musk's companies require a type of government support that's futuristic rather than retro. Electric cars are a threat to the oil business. Solar power \u2014 Tesla just acquired SolarCity \u2014 has benefitted from government subsidies to gain a foothold against traditional grid electricity provided by burning coal and natural gas. SpaceX has NASA as its biggest customer.\n\nMusk is a shining example of a businessperson who's making America great now. It remains to be seen if Trump can digest that reality and come to terms with how that reality has been achieved."}

Yet from July 31 to August 15, this remote farming town received close to 36,000 visitors.\n\nThat's because since 1983, Clarkston has been the home of Martin Harris: The Man Who Knew, a pageant that depicts the life of Martin Harris, who became one of the Three Witnesses to testify of the divine origin of the Book of Mormon. The events leading up to the first publication of the Book of Mormon and Martin's role in those events are presented in an outdoor amphitheater adjacent to where Martin is buried in the Clarkston cemetery.\n\nIncluded in those events is the incident involving the 116 manuscript pages of the Book of Mormon where, in June of 1828, after Martin's repeated entreaties, Joseph Smith allowed him to take the pages to show his family. Unfortunately, through Martin's negligence, the pages were lost. Both Martin and Joseph were reprimanded.\n\nBrad Noble, who played the role of Martin Harris in the last two productions, said one of the big themes of the pageant is that of forgiveness and repentance. \"There's a line that I love at the end of the play where Joseph explains to Martin that we all need forgiveness and it's Christ's Atonement that does that for each and every one of us,\" said Brother Noble.\n\nNot only is Martin forgiven, but he also becomes one of three men allowed to see the angel Moroni display the gold plates. After the witnesses saw and handled the plates, a voice from heaven declared that the record was true and had been translated correctly.\n\nEach performance begins with the testimony of the Three Witnesses that is now included in the foreword of the Book of Mormon. Brother Noble said, \"Every time [I speak those words]\u2014from the first time we did it in rehearsal and every time I step out on stage\u2014I get chills. I feel the Spirit every time. I know Martin saw what he saw because I feel it every time.\"\n\nThe hour-and-fifteen-minute production is staged every odd year with a cast of about 80, with 150 volunteers. Cast members put in long hours of rehearsals and performances. However, many cast members are quick to note the blessings.\n\n\"This pageant is a smorgasbord, and, if you allow yourself, it is an absolute feast,\" said Jeff Richins, who played Joseph Smith Sr. in this year's production but has also played the part of Martin Harris and other roles. \"You can't have an experience like this every night and not want to put yourself back in that environment.\"\n\nPrior to each performance, cast members spent time talking with visitors, often answering questions about their character or about Joseph Smith and the Restoration. Brother Richins took the opportunity during every show to give away a copy of the Book of Mormon, in which he had written his testimony. Many other cast members reported similar experiences throughout the three-week performance schedule.\n\n\"We're here to perform, but we're also here to be missionaries,\" explained Maggie Porter, who was part of this year's ensemble cast. \"This is my own little mission.\"\n\nTerra Smith, who played Lucy Mack Smith, the mother of the Prophet Joseph Smith, has participated in various ways in the pageant for more than a decade. The pageant has provided an opportunity for her to strengthen not only her own testimony but also the testimonies of her children, now ages 14, 13, and 12.\n\n\"It's been a wonderful opportunity for [my children] to not only learn the story of Martin Harris and the story of how the Book of Mormon was first published and how it really came to be, but it also gives them an opportunity to really understand what missionary work is and to have that personal testimony built for themselves as well.\"\n\nTravis and Angela Parry and their five children, ranging from age 11 to 2, all participated in the pageant together and made it a goal for each"}

They seem to be trapped inside a formless screen, their surrounding the mysterious pitch-black universe, the mystical nebula with twinkling stars. Beneath them, was the titanous yellow-earth backdrop of the planet. Because they had entered this world as a temporary party, thus, the ending of this story was similar.\n\nFollowing that, was naturally the battlefield overview reflection. Firstly, the screen shone with the encounters of Reef and the other bunch of contestants when accomplishing the main mission. The crazed resistance against the arachnids in Steel Whip base\u2026.encountering a flaming beetle on the way to Whisky base\u2026.reuniting with the Roughnecks\u2026..finally, the deaths of Johnny Rico and the other main storyline characters.\n\nNext, Sheyan's reflection of events were much lesser. Obviously, his unorthodox path led to his abandonment of the main mission. His first reflection was the moment he killed that gigantic scourge back in Steep Whip base. The second was fast-forwarded to the moment he reached the tragic scene of the main character. The third was the emotional explosion of the Tyrannical Spore Colony.\n\nThe battle summary finally concluded. The realm flashed out the following information:\n\nTime: Galaxy era.

Reef sighed and said.\n\n\"Such an arduous main mission for this mid difficulty setting\u2026..indeed it is a little too demanding of a temporary constructed party. But if everyone had worked and cooperated together, especially you Seaman. If you could've displayed your schemes right at the start, we would've been able to succeed.\"\n\nSheyan shrugged his shoulders, sincerely replying.\n\n\"Let's not talk about others. If I had tried to give orders at the start, would you have been convinced?\"\n\nReef was stunned, sighing, sighing again as he shook his head and sighed once more. Then he forced out a smile.\n\nSheyan patted Reef's shoulder and continued.\n\n\"No matter what, we still managed to survive, that itself is enough. What are your plans from now?\"\n\nReef raised his eyes to observe Sheyan, then he gently replied.\n\n\"Why? Trying to recruit me?\"\n\nSheyan bluntly replied.\n\n\"That's right.

As long as we don't give up on them and trust them, then justice and integrity would never die. I'll definitely make genuine companions!\"\n\nAs he speaked on, Reef's voice steadily turned passionate. Sheyan carefully listened, before he hung down his eyes and replied.\n\n\"I can only say, I do agree with some of your ideologies.\"\n\nReef shook his head.\n\n\"This world is filled with evil, but we cannot be influenced by it.

How does Dell's tablet stack up to the iPad?\n\nOn Monday, for one day only, Microsoft's online store and retail locations will sell Dell's Venue 8 Pro Windows 8.1 tablet for $99, an eye-opening $200 off the new device's regular price. If you've been on the fence about buying a Windows tablet this holiday season, you're unlikely to find many deals better than this one.\n\nDell's 8-inch slate isn't the first mini-tablet to run the full version of Windows, including desktop apps. But earlier efforts, such as Acer's Iconia W3, were hampered by cheap hardware and slow processors, to say nothing of Windows 8's rough edges and infamous learning curve. Dell's Venue line, in contrast, has been generally well-received. Forrester analyst David Johnson told InformationWeek in October that the devices are compelling options that compare favorably to more expensive and ballyhooed options, such as Microsoft's Surface tablets.\n\nBut you'll have to act fast if you want in on this deal. The offer is good only on Monday, and each Microsoft location will sell only twenty Venue 8 Pros at $99. After that, the devices will sell for $199 - still a pretty good deal - until inventory is depleted. Microsoft's online store will offer the Venue 8 Pro for $99 to the first 100 customers. After that, the cost shifts to $199 for the rest of the day or while supplies last.\n\n[ Buying a tablet this holiday season? Read Tablet Shopping Guide: 8 Tips. ]\n\nThe promotion is available only to customers in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Each customer is also limited to one device.\n\nIn limited use, I've found the Venue 8 Pro to be snappy and responsive. Its quad-core \"Bay Trail\" processor is a noticeable improvement over previous Intel Atom chips, and though its screen doesn't boast the resolution of some competing options, the device's 1200x800-pixel display is still quite decent.\n\nDell's Venue 8 Pro supports stylus and keyboard accessories.\n\nWindows 8.1 is also a major improvement over Windows 8. The update's app-snapping multi-tasking function is particularly welcome on an 8-inch display because it allows users to split the screen evenly between two apps. In the original version of Windows 8, one app had to occupy three-quarters of the display, which made multi-tasking impractical on smaller tablets.\n\nOther Venue 8 Pro appeals include a preloaded copy of Office Home & Student 2013, 32 GB of storage and 2 GB of RAM. It also includes a Micro USB port and can run for up to 10 hours between charges.\n\nAre there any reasons not to take advantage of this sale? A few.\n\nFor starters, buying a Windows 8.1 tablet isn't the same as buying an Android or iOS tablet. They're all fine for accessing the Web, sending email or watching Netflix, but if you're looking for an expanded ecosystem of touch-first apps, iOS and Android still set the standard. Windows 8.1's app store isn't as impoverished as it was once, but the Venue 8 Pro's major sales draw isn't touch apps; it's support for desktop software, particularly Microsoft Office.\n\nDoes this make the Venue 8 Pro more productive than an iPad? It depends. The Venue 8 Pro offers stylus support and can connect to third-party keyboards via Bluetooth. Dell also plans to release its own keyboard accessory soon. These tools will be useful to some, but desktop software will provide only so much utility running on such a small form factor. The Venue 8 Pro won't replace a laptop, but it could be a terrific secondary device for work.\n\nDisplay resolution might be another concern. The Venue 8 Pro's screen is serviceable-- but it's also put to shame by the new iPad Mini's 2048x1536-pixel Retina display. Some might also be bothered by the awkward placement of the Start button; many Windows tablets place the button beneath the screen, in the middle of the bottom bezel, but Dell counter-intuitively positioned the button on the device's top-right edge. Other might be peeved that the device's 10-hour battery life can only be achieved if the screen brightness is turned down; otherwise, the battery runs closer to eight hours. The Venue 8 Pro also lacks an HDMI port for connecting the tablet to a monitor or television, though Windows 8.1's native Miracast support somewhat mitigates this concern.\n\nBut given that the device is being offered at such extreme discounts, most of these concerns are minor quibbles.\n\nAnd if you miss out on the Venue 8 Pro 8, don't"}

Now some researchers\u2014led by Aylin Caliskan-Islam, a PhD student at Drexel University\u2014have recently discovered that this technique can be applied to code as well to determine who programmed it.\n\n\"Every developer has preferences not only for things like spacing (spaces vs tabs), naming styles (CamelCase vs. snake_case) and commenting, but also how he or she implements certain types of functionality,\" explains Phil Johnson in ITWorld.\n\nOther traits that that the researchers used included layout (such as the white space in the program) and lexical attributes (for example, counts of various types of tokens), Johnson explains. \"Their real innovation, though, was in developing what they call 'abstract syntax trees' which are similar to parse trees for sentences, and are derived from language-specific syntax and keywords,\" he continues. \"These trees capture a syntactic feature set which, the authors wrote, 'was created to capture properties of coding style that are completely independent from writing style.'\"\n\nIn other words, \"Programmers can obfuscate their variable or function names, but not the structures they subconsciously prefer to use or their favorite increment operators,\" the researchers say in a lecture about the project.\n\nThe technique was developed by gathering publicly available C++ source code from seven years' worth of Google's Code Jam, an annual programming competition that attracts a wide range of programmers\u2014more than 100,000 in total. Eventually, they achieved a 95 percent success rate, Johnson writes, which rises to 97 percent as the code sample sizes increase. The more complex the programming problem, the better success researchers had in identifying the coder, he adds.\n\nOf course success first requires having a known database of programmers and their code with which to compare it. This was apparently left as an exercise for the reader.\n\nWhy is this a big deal? Does it really matter who wrote some piece of code? It does when you consider that stylometry could be used to help identify the author of malicious source code. It might also help resolve plagiarism and copyright disputes.\n\n\"Source code authorship attribution could provide proof of authorship in court, automate the process of finding a cyber criminal from the source code left in an infected system, or aid in resolving copyright, copyleft and plagiarism issues in the programming fields,\" the researchers write. Less seriously, it could also be used in computer programming classes to determine whether students are cheating on the assignments.\n\nStylometry is also being considered as a security method by organizations such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the U.S. Army\u2014where, incidentally, Caliskan-Islam served as a visiting researcher.\n\nIn fact, this research could put some programmers at risk, the researchers warn. Programmers could now be identified when they contribute to an open-source project\u2014which could get sticky when they don't want their employer to know. It also becomes risky to work on something embarrassing\u2014or dangerous. \"An Iranian programmer was sentenced to death in 2012 for developing photo sharing software that was used on pornographic websites,\" researchers note. \"Sadly but predictably, there is virtually no technical difference between security-enhancing and privacy-infringing use cases.\""}

(Photo: Ryan Sabalow/The Star)Buy Photo\n\nTiffany Compton is a former police officer. She has worked as a guard in an all-male lockup inside a state prison. She knows how to use deadly force and take down bad guys twice her size.\n\nBut when Compton, 29, recently found herself alone and intimidated on a recent morning, it wasn't at the hands of hardened criminals. It was a group of duck hunters.\n\nThe Indianapolis woman had walked into a wildlife area office to sign up for her first public-lands duck hunt. She was the only woman in a room full of camouflaged men. Immediately, she felt the stares.\n\nAnd then, with her back turned, she heard words that made her cringe. It was a father talking to his son.\n\n\"As I'm looking at the map,\" Compton recalled, \"I can hear the dad chuckle, and he says (to his son), 'I know what you're looking at.' \"\n\nWomen are increasingly making inroads into traditionally male-dominated hunting and shooting sports. Still, stories such as Compton's are common \u2014 and they illustrate a troubling hurdle for hunting groups, wildlife agencies and outdoor retailers seeking recruits to a sport that isn't growing.\n\nBased on surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of U.S. hunters has largely stayed flat or declined in recent years, a factor hunting associations and wildlife officials blame at least in part to increased urbanization. The trend poses a particular challenge for state wildlife agencies, whose funding is almost entirely dependent on fishing and hunting license fees and taxes on hunting and shooting equipment.\n\n\"The very last thing you want to do is make a new hunter feel uncomfortable in a scenario like you described when she's simply trying to draw for a blind,\" said Nick Pinizzotto, president and CEO of the U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance, a hunting and shooting lobbying group. \"Women hunting is the best thing that could happen to our sport.\"\n\nAfter all, he said, female hunters \u2014 or even women who might be merely supportive of hunting \u2014 are key allies at the voting booth or in public policy debates about hunting and gun-rights issues.\n\n'Be prepared to deal with that sexism'\n\nOf the 13.7 million hunters in the U.S. in 2011, 11 percent were women \u2014 and that's up from 9 percent since 2001.\n\nWomen also make up a growing demographic among firearms owners.\n\nFor example, the number of women with gun permits in Indiana jumped 42.6 percent since 2012 \u2014 from 86,617 permits two years ago to 123,536 through the first quarter of this year. The National Rifle Association estimated that about 25 percent of 70,000 attendees at its Indianapolis convention this year were women.\n\nWith female hunters and shooters on the rise, companies have taken notice. Women now increasingly host big-game hunting cable television shows; outdoor retailers have begun marketing products and gear designed for women; and one of the nation's most venerable hunting magazines, Field & Stream, recently put a female hunter on its cover.\n\nBut Compton's story and several others that female hunters told The Indianapolis Star illustrate the depth of the problems women face from some male hunters. Women shared with The Star not only tales of sexism and mere rudeness, but disturbing examples of sexual harassment in the field, at outdoors retailers and at conferences.\n\n\"Men need to be involved in changing that climate,\" said Nadya Fouad, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who has studied barriers to minorities and women entering workplaces dominated by white men. \"That's going to take some time. Meanwhile, women need to be prepared to deal with that sexism.\"\n\n'It is a lot of sexual comments sometimes'\n\nMorgan Born knows a thing or two about that. The 20-year-old mother from Lake County says she basically taught herself, a female friend and her boyfriend how to hunt ducks.\n\nBut in spite of being as skilled as any man in the duck blind, she said, there are some public duck hunting areas near her home where she won't go because \"a little circle of men\" have repeatedly made her feel uncomfortable or were rude to her and her female hunting partner.\n\n\"It gets kind of weird at times,\" Born said. \"You get a lot of comments like, 'I wish you would come in our blind.' It's like, 'Oh my God.' It is a lot of sexual comments sometimes.\"\n\nTerri Millefoglie, a conservation officer with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, said now that she's an officer with a gun and a badge, male hunters are much more respectful, but she remembers what it was like being the only woman signing in at public hunting"}

In the present study, a research effort has been made to document in detail the behavioural manifestations of congenital amusia. A group of 11 adults, fitting stringent criteria of musical disabilities, were examined in a series of tests originally designed to assess the presence and specificity of musical disorders in brain\u2010damaged patients. The results show that congenital amusia is related to severe deficiencies in processing pitch variations. The deficit extends to impairments in music memory and recognition as well as in singing and the ability to tap in time to music. Interestingly, the disorder appears specific to the musical domain. Congenital amusical individuals process and recognize speech, including speech prosody, common environmental sounds and human voices, as well as control subjects. Thus, the present study convincingly demonstrates the existence of congenital amusia as a new class of learning disabilities that affect musical abilities.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLanguage and music have many similarities. Notably, language and music are universal and specific to humans. Despite the complex abilities involved in both domains, linguistic and musical competence develop in the child spontaneously, without conscious effort or formal instruction. However, a few individuals suffer from severe language acquisition impairments, which are not consequent to any hearing deficiency, mental retardation or lack of environmental stimulation (e.g. Benton, 1964; Gopnik and Crago, 1991). Such a specific language impairment affects between 3 and 6% of the population (e.g. Wrightet al., 1997). Considering the similarities between music and language, we can expect that a similar proportion of individuals from the general population experience music\u2010specific impairments. Affected individuals would be born without the essential wiring elements for the development of a normally functioning system for music. This condition is variously termed tune\u2010deafness, tone\u2010deafness, dysmelodia or dysmusia in the literature. However, we prefer to refer to this learning disability with the less restrictive label of 'congenital amusia', because there may be as many different forms of developmental amusias as there are varieties of acquired amusias that result from accidental brain damage in adulthood.\n\nCongenital amusia is a condition that has been known for more than a century, since the pioneering study published by Grant\u2010Allen in 1878. Grant\u2010Allen reports the case of a 30\u2010year\u2010old man with a solid education and without neurological lesion, who suffers from a severe musical handicap. The man was unable to discriminate the pitch of two successive tones, failed to recognize familiar melodies and could not carry a tune. He exhibited an overall indifference towards music. Yet, the musical defect could not be explained by a lack of exposure to music since the man had received musical lessons during childhood (Grant\u2010Allen, 1879). A century later, Geshwind published a similar case (Geshwind, 1984). The case was a man who came from a musically impaired family, despite their frequent exposure to recorded music at home. As a child, this man attempted piano lessons, but his teacher soon realized that he could not sing, nor discriminate between two pitches and could not keep time. Interestingly, this same subject could speak three foreign languages fluently.\n\nThough indicative, these two studies are anecdotal since they are descriptive and not supported by systematic evaluations. Two large\u2010scale studies were run to quantify the musical disorder. In 1948, Fry evaluated a 1200 subject sample on tests requiring the subjects to compare two notes or two musical phrases in order to detect a change in pitch. From these results, Fry estimated that 5% of the British population were amusical. This author further argued that musical memory problems as well as a difficulty in pitch discrimination might be the major determinants of congenital amusia (Fry, 1948). However, these claims were not supported by data analyses. More recently, Kalmus and Fry ran another large\u2010scale study with 604 unselected adults who were required to detect anomalous pitches inserted in melodies (Kalmus and Fry, 1980). From these results, 4.2% of the British adult population were estimated to be amusical. However, this estimate is problematic. First, the measure lacks sensitivity since >90% of the participants were performing at ceiling. Secondly, a single measure of musical ability may have both poor validity and poor reliability. Above all, such a psychometric definition of congenital amusia is unconvincing because the sole consideration of one tail of the normal distribution on a single test does not provide convincing evidence that congenital amusia is a real affliction and not a statistical anomaly.\n\nIn summary, previous studies of congenital amusia provide valuable information regarding the nature of congenital amusia, while they do not offer a solid empirical basis. Thus, the major objective of the present study"}

The new substance, Vantablack S-VIS, is easily applied at large scale to virtually any surface, whilst still delivering the proven performance of Vantablack.\n\nVantablack's nano-structure absorbs virtually all incident light, enabling the performance of precision optical systems to be optimized. The material's developer, UK-based Surrey NanoSystems, has mimicked the performance of its original Vantablack with a new version that can be sprayed onto objects, rather than deposited using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process.\n\nVantablack S-VIS greatly widens the potential applications space, making it possible to coat larger complex shapes and structures. It is applied at temperatures that are easily withstood by common plastics, further extending its use. Even though the material is applied using a simple spraying process, it traps a massive 99.8% of incident light. This property gives Vantablack S-VIS its ability to make objects appear to be two-dimensional black holes, as it becomes impossible to make-out surface topography.\n\nThe only other commercially-available material that is darker than the new S-VIS version is original Vantablack, which set a world record for absorption of light at a staggering 99.965%. Vantablack was originally developed for satellite-borne earth observation imaging and calibration systems, where it increases instrument sensitivity by improving absorption of stray ultraviolet, visible and infrared light. Since then, many other applications have emerged, including solar-energy collector elements, functional surfaces in buildings and architecture, cinematographic projectors, high-performance baffles and lenses, and scientific instruments. Its ability to deceive the eye also opens-up a range of design-possibilities to enhance styling and appearance in luxury goods and jewellery.\n\n\"The original Vantablack coating has had a big impact on the market, and is helping many companies to bring out higher-performing equipment,\" says Ben Jensen of Surrey NanoSystems. \"We are continuing to develop the technology, and the new sprayable version really does open up the possibility of applying super-black coatings in many more types of airborne or terrestrial applications. Possibilities include commercial products such as cameras, equipment requiring improved performance in a smaller form factor, as well as differentiating the look of products by means of the coating's unique aesthetic appearance. It's a major step forward compared with today's commercial absorber coatings.\"\n\nVantablack S-VIS is so effective that its performance far outstrips that of any other conventionally-applied coating, typically achieving a reflectance of less than 0.2%. Unlike other black absorbers, it offers this exceptional performance across a wide-range of viewing angles and wavelengths, which is critical for optical instruments, as well as in many aesthetic applications. It is, for example, some 17 times less reflective than the super-black paint used for minimizing stray light in the Hubble space telescope.\n\nThe active element of Vantablack S-VIS is a carbon nanotube matrix. The coating is applied using a proprietary process that includes a number of pre- and post-application steps to achieve its ultra-low reflectance.\n\nVantablack S-VIS can be applied to most stable surfaces, with the only major constraint being the ability to withstand temperatures of 100 degrees Centigrade, making Vantablack S-VIS suitable for many types of engineering-grade polymers and composite materials. The process is scalable and suitable for high-volume production on a range of substrate sizes.\n\nThe structured surface of Vantablack S-VIS means that it is not recommended for applications where it is subject to physical contact or abrasion. Ideally, it should be applied to surfaces that are protected, either within a packaged product, or behind a glass or other protective layer.\n\nCoating with Vantablack S-VIS is offered as a service from Surrey NanoSystems' processing centre in the UK. It is also available under license to companies wishing to integrate the coating into their production processes.\n\nENDS\n\nMedia contact: Ben Jensen, t: +44 (0) 1273 515899\n\nJournalists have permission to use any picture from this article or from our pictures page as long as they are attributed to Surrey NanoSystems\n\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\nA few of Vantablack S-VIS's technical specifications:\n\n* THR (total hemispherical"}

Sittenfeld led a 25-minute presentation, displaying life-size photos of the smiling superstar at City Hall and playing a video presentation on the Cincinnati native's life for fellow council members. And 25 minutes later, council voted to rename a city street in her honor \u2013 Doris Day Way.\n\nIt was a sentimental gesture to recognize a famous Cincinnatian. But it is also an increasingly common way for City Council to spend its time as Election Day nears.\n\nSo far in 2017, as most of council faces re-election, it has renamed 20 streets to celebrate history or honor notable residents such as Buddy LaRosa and Bootsy Collins.\n\nMeanwhile bigger issues, such as what to do about the dilapidated Police District 5 and the number of cancer diagnoses of officers who work there, seem to simmer without much attention.\n\nThe Doris Day presentation came just a day after another officer had been diagnosed with cancer while city leaders delayed plans to move officers from the troubled District 5 building for months.\n\nIt prompted Hamilton County Republican Party Chair Alex Triantafilou to tweet \"While @CityOfCincy PD faces a real crisis in Dist. 5, your council is enjoying pictures of Doris Day.

Get serious. \u2014 Alex Triantafilou (@ChairmanAlex) September 27, 2017\n\nWith the election weeks away, and six of the nine council members running for re-election, WCPO examined the number of resolutions it passed that don't change city policy in any way.\n\nFor example, in 2017, City Council passed 17 resolutions voicing their opinions on a range of state and national topics, such as the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the nation's withdrawal from the Paris Climate agreement.\n\nCouncilman Charlie Winburn chided his fellow council members for spending the bulk of a 28-minute meeting in September talking about President Donald Trump's order to end a policy allowing children of immigrants to stay in the United States legally.\n\nHe ticked off a number of issues \u2013 from the streetcar's operating budget to the heroin epidemic \u2013 that City Council should spend time on instead.\n\n\"Our time is better spent on these issues,\" Winburn said. \"We are not being fair to Cincinnatians when we focus on taking symbolic stands on national issues.\"\n\nCouncilman Charles Winburn speaks during a Cincinnati City Council meeting on Oct. 18, 2017. Photo by Leigh Taylor\n\nAnd taking a stance on national issues \u2013 particularly with a controversial president like Trump -- can be a good way for some council members to win favor with their base.\n\n\"If you're Chris Seelbach and you're saying things that appeal to a group of liberals in the community, they're happy when you speak out against (Donald) Trump,\" said Mack Mariani, chair of Xavier University's political science department. \"They're thinking: 'This Seelbach guy is thinking exactly what I'm thinking.'\"\n\nIt's not just national issues that have sucked up council's time.\n\nThey've spent plenty of time taking up political causes, such as promoting Genocide Awareness Month or opposing Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.\n\nOver their nearly four-year term, members created 68 resolutions recognizing citizen achievements \u2013 from marathon runners to Food Network cooking champions, often with speeches and lengthy presentations.\n\n\"There's a value in recognizing our history and a value in celebrating the good feeling people have for the city and its people,\" said University of Cincinnati political science professor David Niven. \"But it can only be a part of the job. \u2026 When it's a regular, reoccurring and often central accomplishment of the day, that's where it becomes a reason to be concerned.\"\n\nCouncilman Chris Seelbach routinely honors city residents during LGBT Pride Month and Councilwoman Yvette Simpson does the same for Black History Month, as a way to recognize important achievements.\n\nSittenfeld has had a busy and productive year on City Council \u2013 from new policy that forces banks to maintain foreclosed properties to launching a 'Golden Cincinnati' Initiative that created an aging and accessibility czar at City Hall. He also spearheaded an idea to use technology to solve the heroin crisis.\n\nThe resolutions he's sponsored are just another way to respond to his constituents, he said.\n\n\"I'm not sure I've ever done a resolution without someone in the community saying 'This is really important,'\" Sittenfeld said. \"It takes almost no time, and it's almost always in response to sincere citizens who care about issues and want their elected leadership to take a position.\""}

However, the optimal timing of surgery with respect to age at presentation and the influence of underlying pathology on outcome is only slowly emerging. This study reports on the clinical course and outcomes of 33 children who underwent hemispherectomy at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, between 1991 and 1997. Age at surgery was 0.33\u201317 years (median 4.25) with 1\u20138 years follow\u2010up (median 3.4). The underlying pathology was developmental in 16 (10 hemimegalencephaly, two polymicrogyria, two focal cortical dysplasia, one diffuse cortical dysplasia and one microdysgenesis), acquired in 11 (six middle cerebral artery infarct, three post encephalitis/trauma, and one each of hemiconvulsion\u2013hemiplegia epilepsy and perinatal ischaemic insult) and progressive in six children (four Rasmussen encephalitis, two Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome). At follow\u2010up, 52% were seizure free, 9% experienced rare seizures, 30% showed >75% reduction in seizures and 9% showed <75% seizure reduction or no improvement. Seizure freedom was highest in those with acquired pathology (82%), followed by those with progressive pathology (50%) and those with developmental pathology (31%). However, seizure freedom, rare seizures or >75% reduction in seizures occurred in 100% of those with progressive pathology, 91% of those with acquired and 88% of those with developmental pathology, indicating a worthwhile seizure outcome in all groups. Hemiplegia remained unchanged following surgery in 22 out of 33 children, improved in five and was worse in six. No significant cognitive deterioration or loss of language occurred, and four children showed significant cognitive improvement. Behavioural improvement was reported in 92% of those who had behaviour problems pre\u2010operatively.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHemispherectomy was described independently in 1928 by Dandy and L'Hermitte (Rasmussen, 1983) as a radical treatment for malignant glioma of one hemisphere, but with a failure to offer improvements in survival or quality of life compared with more conservative treatments. Further interest in the procedure followed the publication in 1950 (Krynauw, 1950) of a study of a series of 12 children with infantile hemiplegia, seizures and behaviour disorders who underwent hemispherectomy for epilepsy with good seizure outcome. The popularity of anatomical hemispherectomy subsequently declined in the late 1960s because of the delayed complications of the procedure (Oppenheimer and Griffith, 1966; Till, 1967; Brett, 1969), which included obstructive hydrocephalus, superficial haemosiderosis and intracranial haematomata in as many as 33% patients (Rasmussen, 1983). However, a modification of the procedure (Adams, 1983) and the development of the sub\u2010total or functional hemispherectomy (Rasmussen, 1983; Tinuper et al., 1988) largely abolished these complications.\n\nHemispherectomy can be considered for those with seizures arising from one hemisphere where there is a pre\u2010existing structural abnormality of that hemisphere. It is particularly suitable for those with a pre\u2010existing hemiplegia and/or visual field deficit, a group in whom co\u2010existing cognitive and behavioural impairments are common. However, it may be offered to those without such disabilities in circumstances such as Rasmussen syndrome, where inevitable deterioration in epilepsy is accompanied by deterioration of both motor and intellectual performance (Vining et al., 1997) and where lesser resections are unsuccessful (Platt et al., 1988).\n\nThe effectiveness of hemispherectomy for epilepsy associated with congenital hemiplegia was initially evaluated by the degree of seizure relief it offered (the traditional outcome measure used in adult epilepsy surgery). Seizure outcome was impressive but positive effects on cognition and behaviour were increasingly reported and were replicated by other groups in the 269 published reports of the procedure by 1961 (Rasmussen, 1983). The cognitive and behavioural impairments associated with congenital hemiplegia may be profound, especially for those with very early onset epilepsy and dysplastic lesions in whom development appears to remain arrested until clinical and sub\u2010clinical seizure activity is abolished. Such secondary impairments, which constitute the severe epileptic encephalopathy suffered by these children, are emerging as the main target for epilepsy surgery in childhood. The aim is to offer surgery at a younger age in order to maximise the beneficial effects on developmental trajectory. This aim challenges our ability both to predict outcome and to justify major surgery in very young children. In the context of clinical decision\u2010making, it would be very difficult to randomize to early or late surgery. At this stage, therefore, we have to analyse our attempts to address these issues in the clinical setting and this is the main purpose of this study. We report the clinical outcomes of hemispherect"}

And given a title like Lockpick Pornography, I figured, how can you go wrong? Now, the book and its sequel are slated to be published in an omnibus volume from ECW Press, so what better time to write this review? (I actually finished the blessed thing last summer while on a roadtrip to visit relatives.)\n\n\nAs you may be able to surmise from the opening paragraph, I wanted to like this book. I wanted a good deal to like this book. But somehow I never got round to it. I didn't dislike it, mind you, but it never reached out and grabbed me. Normally, I'd give the writer of such a thing the benefit of the doubt, but I'm not going to in this case; I'm pretty sure the problem doesn't lie with me here. Comeau has a lot of big ideas, and it's really quite commendable that he's going to attempt to tackle them. The problem is, he never actually does. I'm not sure whether he's just throwing stuff out there with the belief that \"if you're reading this book, you probably feel the same way I do about these things, so I really don't need to go into any detail\" (which, at best, would be hopelessly na\u00efve), simply using this stuff as plot device (which, at best, would be exploitative), or throwing it in simply for shock value (in which case, this would be bizarro fiction, but not as accomplished as the better bizarro authors). I toyed around with possibility #3 for about a week after finishing the book before throwing it out; there's enough passion in the places where Comeau makes an attempt at addressing all this stuff\u2014the raging anti-capitalism, the gender dysphoria (and inventive ways his characters have of dealing with that), the sometimes-irresistable urge to take your experimental novel and turn it into a genre noir thriller\u2014that I'm pretty sure he's not just trolling. And #2 doesn't quite feel right, either, and for much the same reason; I'm not sure someone using gender dysphoria solely as a plot device would be able to handle it with Comeau's sardonic-but-not-cruel take.\n\n\nWhich leaves me with choice #1, but I kind of feel like a heel employing it, no matter how na\u00efve the resulting novel turns out to be.\n\n\nThe unfortunate part about it is that author na\u00efvete turns into character shallowness, as no one in the novel ever gives even the most passing thought to why they're all doing this. In his defense, I should say that it seems Comeau either attempts and fails, or had thought about attempting and then abandoned the idea, to rectify this in the book's climactic sequence; I was planning on going on with that statement, but then realized we'd be well into spoiler alert territory, so trust me on this one.\n\n\nI haven't yet read any of Comeau's more recent, and much more popular novels (my local public library, which is notorious for carrying very little other than Stephen King and Danielle Steel, even has a copy of One Bloody Thing After Another!), so I can't just pop out some sort of wry comment about how Lockpick Pornography is a rough early example of the style of etc., and yet for some reason I want to; that's what it feels like, anyway. It's very much a style-over-substance book, and I'd imagine it will have a great deal of appeal to the twenty-first-century version of the disaffected youth who flocked to see movies like Been Down So Long It Feels Like Up to Me back in the seventies. Be aware, however, you will have to fill in a number of wide, unbridged gaps that it doesn't seem to me you should have to. ** \u00bd"}

Yes.\n\nWe know beyond any reasonable doubt that increased saturated fat intake raises LDL cholesterol levels; and over time, higher LDL levels promote more atheroclerosis and cardiovascular-related mortality.\n\nTo bolster this ridiculous claim, the Post referred repeatedly to a study published in the March issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The study analyzed several epidemiological studies (the studies' lengths ranged from 5 to 23 years) and found no significant evidence that dietary saturated fat is linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nBut here's the problem: It has always been very difficult to find any significant correlation between saturated fat intake and cardiovascular disease using epidemiological data within a given population. The reason is not because a correlation does not exist but because of the way people's eating habits are measured. In these epidemiological studies, scientists used dietary recall data, \"but dietary recall data are very inaccurate,\" points out Dr. Jay Kenney, Nutrition Research Specialist at the Pritikin Longevity Center.\n\nIn numerous investigations on the efficacy of 24-hour dietary records, scientists have found that the majority of people cannot estimate their food intake, or forget what they have eaten, or outright lie (Who wants to admit they wolfed down two cheeseburgers for lunch?).\n\nAnd even when 24-hour food recalls are fairly accurate, they are still highly suspect as a measurement of people's overall food intake.\n\nFirst of all, people often eat very different amounts of saturated fat from day to day. The day they recorded their sat fat intake may have been the day they had bean chili for dinner. The next day (the day that was not recorded) may have ended with a sirloin steak and cr\u00e8me brulee.\n\nSecondly, people often change their diets over time, especially in industrialized countries like the U.S. Hence, what their daily diet was at the beginning of a 10-year study may have changed significantly two, three, or five years into the study.\n\n\"The point is: When your measurements of dietary variables are very inaccurate \u2013 and when you have no scientific tool to measure subjects' eating habits over long periods of time \u2013 the odds of finding a significant correlation, even if one exists, go way down,\" states Dr. Kenney.\n\nOf course, if we study the actual cultures and eating habits of populations that we know eat far less saturated fat over their lifetimes, we see much lower levels of cholesterol in these populations, and much lower levels of cardiovascular events like heart attacks.\n\nHere are two examples:\n\nOkinawa\n\nResearchers traveled to Okinawa and for years tracked the daily eating habits of the people living on this island off the coast of Japan. It was easy to confirm that Okinawa's people ate very little saturated fat because there wasn't much of the fat on the island to begin with. The population followed a diet (as they had for centuries) that was high in unrefined carbohydrates like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. They ate up to 20 servings of unrefined carbohydrates daily. Staples included sweet potatoes, dark green vegetables, green peppers, rice, fresh fruit, tofu (and other forms of soy), as well as seafood rich in omega-3 fatty acids. While fish made up about 11% of the diet, only about 3% came from saturated-fat-containing foods like poultry and meat.\n\nOn this very low-in-saturated-fat diet, Okinawa's citizens were found to have 80% fewer heart attacks than Americans. They were also lean (Take that, Atkins diet proponents), averaging a body mass index of just 22. There's more good news: They had (and still have) the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world. They also have the highest percentage of citizens over the age of 100. Is there a correlation here between low-in-saturated-fat diets and very low rates of heart disease? You bet.\n\nThe China Study\n\nHeralded as the most comprehensive study of diet and disease ever conducted, the China Study by Cornell University scientists looked at 16,700 individuals in the 65 provinces of China over a six-year period in the 1980s. It examined more than 1,000 separate diet, lifestyle, and environmental aspects relating to each of the subjects.\n\nThe provinces with the least amount of cardiovascular disease were those following a very low-"}

Gary McCullough/AP\n\nHere in Canada's largest city, this American football player sounds like a local, because he is one. A few blocks back is the historic row house built circa 1883 that Odrick bought in mid-June, setting a new price ceiling for this neighborhood of Toronto. This is the first property Odrick has ever owned. Not in Miami, where he was a first-round draft pick by the Dolphins in 2010. Not in Jacksonville, where he signed a five-year, $42.5 million contract in 2015 free agency. The 28-year-old Pennsylvania native has found a home outside America and outside football.\n\n\"Team sports take away individuality,\" Odrick muses as the cab rolls along. \"That's my lead-up to why I'm here in Toronto. I'm doing my own thing, and people think it is so weird when I go back.\"\n\nIt might sound ironic, but Odrick is breaking out of the football culture to maximize his career as a football player. For the next 12 hours on this day in June, he'll shuttle between four different appointments as part of a meticulous program to prime his 6-foot-5, 301-pound body for the 2016 season. He's the kind of guy who approaches life tactically, writing down bullet-point strategies for his goals in life. The time he spends in Toronto is central to his plan for How To Have A Successful NFL Career: Build your own team. Educate yourself. Have a life outside football. Find out more about yourself before you're done playing.\n\nHe leans over and asks the cabbie to take a detour to one of his favorite breakfast spots on Dupont Street.\n\n\"People get blinded by the religion of football,\" Odrick says. \"Players, coaches, fans. But the best way to stay in the business is to keep your personal business running, and the best way to do that is to break some molds. Seek out knowledge on your own. Have individual thoughts. Be a little counter-culture.\"\n\nThat's what he's doing in Canada. As an American citizen, Odrick can only spend up to 180 consecutive days across the border.

Odrick has befriended the owner, Anthony Rose, a Toronto chef who has a colony of restaurants all over the city. Rose helps run a summer lunch program offering healthy and locally sourced meals to area kids, and as Odrick puts down roots in Toronto, he's hoping to lend a hand.\n\nSettling into a wooden booth by the window, Odrick doesn't glance at the menu. He already knows what he wants: the All-Day Breakfast, with three eggs and bacon\u2014he's skipping the pork chop today\u2014and the grilled romaine Caesar.\n\n\"You have to have fat in the morning,\" he says. \"That helps your brain wake up and function.\"\n\nHe follows wellness commandments like this all day.

He steers away from carbs, especially in the morning, instead choosing breakfast foods shown to boost stimulating neurotransmitters like dopamine. The results: His defensive lineman's frame has just 12 percent body fat.\n\nOdrick would like to correct the football culture, at least the parts of it reflected in a sign he remembers hanging in the Dolphins training room: \"Be a player, not a patient,\" a quote from Jason Taylor.\n\nA few weeks ago, the Jaguars' Instagram account posted a Training Tip of the Week, sponsored by a cold-pressed juice brand: \"Pre-exercise meals should be 200-300 calories and 75% carbohydrates and 25% protein.\" Even at the breakfast table, Odrick is doing his own thing.

Winners include Sprouts Farmers Markets in Daly City and Carlsbad, Calif., Ramona High School in Ramona, Calif., Food Forward in North Hollywood, Calif., Cherokee Point Elementary School in San Diego, Calif., the City of San Diego and the San Diego International Airport.\n\n\"Food Recovery Challenge award winners serve as role models in their communities and for other organizations,\" said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. \"Their hard work and effective efforts to divert wasted food from landfills is paying off through social, financial and environmental benefits. I encourage other organizations to replicate the successful food recovery operations of our Challenge winners.\"\n\nEPA recognizes Food Recovery Challenge participants and endorsers with awards in two categories: data-driven and narrative. The data-driven award recipients achieved the highest percent increases in their sector comparing year-to-year data. Narrative award winners excelled in the areas of source reduction, leadership, innovation, education and outreach and endorsement. Nationally, 16 participants received awards. The seven winners in California were:\n\nData-driven Improvement by Sector Winners:\n\nSprouts Farmers Market\n\nGrocer: Carlsbad Store\n\nNewcomer: Daly City Store\n\nSprouts acts on their commitment to Zero Food Waste through their Food Rescue and Food Waste to Farms programs, and through customer engagement, preventing more than 31 million pounds of wasted food from entering landfills and avoiding more than $1.5 million in landfill fees in 2016. Team members participate in training on the importance of food donations in the community, proper shrink management, and guidelines for donations. In 2016, Sprouts was able to provide more than 19 million pounds of nutritious foods to its communities, resulting in nearly 16 million meals. Through its various initiatives, Sprouts has developed successful business-to-business and non-profit relationships that illustrate the power of partnerships to reduce environmental impacts and eliminate hunger in communities.\n\nK-12 Schools: Ramona High School (Ramona)\n\nRamona High School's Eco-Leaders, in collaboration with the County of San Diego and the Ramona Unified School District, run a district-wide, collaborative wasted-food reduction and composting program. Students weigh, measure, chart and keep accurate data from eight school sites. The data is sent electronically to the County each day. Nutrition staff reported revisions to their food preparation practices after seeing how much food was going to waste. Prepared food suitable for donation is placed in a walk-in freezer and collected weekly by a local pantry and distributed to the underserved in the community.\n\nNon-Profits: Food Forward (North Hollywood)\n\nFood Forward rescues fresh local produce that would otherwise go to waste. Produce is collected from over 750 private backyards, 22 weekly farmers' markets, and the downtown Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market. In 2016, the Wholesale Recovery program rescued over 13.7 million pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables. This produce would have otherwise been sent to landfill. One hundred percent of the recovered food is donated, within hours, to hunger relief agencies across eight counties in Southern California. In 2016, Food Forward helped feed 1.25 million individuals facing food insecurity.\n\nNarrative Category Winners:\n\nSource Reduction: Cherokee Point Elementary School (San Diego)\n\nCherokee Point Elementary School is a leader when it comes to reducing and diverting wasted food. With an enrollment of approximately 400 students, all receiving free and reduced price meals, Cherokee Point is committed to reducing wasted food at the source. The school accurately forecasted the amount of food needed for student meals by using the \"offer versus serve\" model which allows students to decline some of the items offered that they don't intend to consume, recovered certain foods and beverages to use in another meal service, and reduced salad bar pan size. Additionally, students separate their food scraps at lunch so they can be sent off-site for composting.\n\nLeadership: City of San Diego (San Diego)\n\nThe City of San Diego's Environmental Services Department's Commercial Food Waste Diversion Program has a comprehensive food recovery education program for commercial food providers. The program had over 80 participants in 2016, composting nearly 8,000 tons of wasted food. Participants included the largest generators of food waste in the city, and all its larger venues, such as the Convention Center, Zoo, Safari Park and SeaWorld San Diego, took part. During 2016, 17 of the larger generators alone increased their food donation by over 3,000 pounds per week."}

If there's a subcategory in rape culture that angers me most, it's victim blaming. The harm that comes from blaming a survivor of sexual assault is so substantial, that it often is as traumatic as the assault itself. The blatant mocking of Epifano that occurs throughout your article is simply unacceptable:\n\n\"Put aside questions about the accuracy of Epifano's recollections and the soundness or gross insensitivity of the counselor's advice. Never mind the absence of discussion about reporting the alleged attack to law enforcement; rape is, after all, a felony, which courts are better equipped to address than colleges. Focus instead on Epifano's reaction to the prospect of a disciplinary hearing: Hours locked in a room with him and being called a liar about being raped? No, thank you. I could barely handle seeing him from the opposite end of campus; I knew I couldn't handle that level of negativity.\"\n\nYou see, Ms. Kaminer, Epifano denied even the thought of going through a trial in order to protect herself. Maybe that seems ridiculous to you, but sometimes after going through a terrible trauma, one cannot possibly bear the thought of recounting that trauma over and over. Also, Epifano may or may not have known this, but out of every 100 rapes, 46 get reported to the police, 12 lead to an arrest, 9 are prosecuted, 5 lead to a felony conviction, and 3 rapists will spend a single day in prison*. The long and frustrating battle to hope that your rapist is not one of the 97% who walk takes a toll on survivors that Epifano didn't want to subject herself to.\n\nAnd that's okay. What you need to realize is that it's okay for Epifano to put herself first. If she didn't feel like she could handle an entire trial, then let's applaud her honesty and willingness to listen to her own needs, instead of criticizing her because you or someone else would've \"done differently.\" In reality no one knows, not even another survivor, of what she's endured.\n\nYou then go on to question the trauma she felt from her rape:\n\n\"Is rape necessarily this traumatic? Are all rapes equal in the damage they inflict? Yes, according to some popular feminist wisdom. No, according to the diverse experiences of rape victims I've known \u2014 including women who've been raped while hitchhiking and by strangers who broke in to their apartments, as well as women raped by dates or acquaintances\u2026 I'm not criticizing or judging Epifano for being acutely frightened and depressed. I'm not presuming to tell women how they should or shouldn't react to being raped. Quite the opposite. I'm simply suggesting that different women react differently, according to their different circumstances, strengths and vulnerabilities. I'm not denying the horrors of rape and the outrage, shame, or fear it can engender, but I am questioning the assumption that it naturally and inevitably breaks women down. I'm wondering if that assumption isn't sometimes self-fulfilling.\"\n\nFirst, I'd be willing to bet that the source you have for that \"popular feminist wisdom\" is incorrect. The feminist approach to rape crisis intervention is letting the survivor know their options and empowering them to make those decisions themselves, in order to put control back in their lives. Secondly, every person reacts entirely differently from any other person who's been raped. You say you understand this, just to go ahead and question the assumption that rape \"naturally and inevitably breaks women down.\" For some, yes, it breaks them down. For others, they can go on with their daily lives as if a rape never happened. One can never assume any reaction from any survivor.\n\nEpifano, no matter her decisions or reactions from her rape, did what she could in order to survive. Maybe you don't agree with how she went about it, but she knows herself better than you do, so stop judging her. She is strong and brave and an inspiration. Angie Epifano is a survivor.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChelcie Laggis, founder of endrapeculture.com"}

With the current iteration of the NIC, the pass rate has dropped to nearly half that of the first year it was available (51% in 2011). This decline suggests that the current exam is invalid, and many are concerned that the testing format of 4-minute vignettes does not sufficiently mimic real-life interpreting scenarios.\n\nDr. Dennis Cokely sent a letter to the RID board in 2012 raising valid questions about the enhanced NIC exam. To quote Dr. Cokely:\n\n\"A clear, empirically supported explanation of why the current NIC assessment is valid and can be reliably assessed by raters must be provided to the membership.\"\n\n(Click here to read his letter that explains his - and our - concerns in detail.)\n\nMore and more states are turning to licensing as a way to protect clients from unqualified signers, and often the requirement for licensure is RID certification. Therefore, it is imperative that we have a reliable and valid exam in place. We recognize that RID is in the process of assembling a certification task force, but we feel the following points need to be addressed with urgency:\n\nDetermine NIC exam validity and establish full transparency about the testing process\n\nIf the test is deemed invalid, develop a new test\n\nPublish the NIC rubric so candidates may properly prepare before testing\n\nProvide more in-depth, personalized feedback on test results\n\nOffer certification process extensions to candidates until a valid test is in place\n\nThese actions will help ensure competent interpreters aren't forced out of the profession due to an invalid certification process.\n\nOur goal is to get as many signatures as possible before August 7th, so that the petition can be seen at the RID National Conference.

I mean, a lot of people don't know this, but earlier this summer the Orpheum Theatre signed an exclusive booking arrangement with Live Nation Entertainment. For people who don't know who Live Nation is, it's a publicly traded mega-corporation based out of Beverly Hills, California, who doesn't have a single full-time employee in the state of Wisconsin. In the industry they're referred to as the Wal-Mart of promoters because they've basically built a business going into cities and either acquiring and downsizing local independent promoters like Frank Productions or simply running them out of business. And it's sad to see the Orpheum allow them into our market to attempt that as well.\" He then goes on to tout the still-unnamed new Frank venue as being locally owned and operated.\n\nIt's a little surprising that he's so openly critical of Live Nation, because Frank has co-presented shows with Live Nation, and there are still Frank Productions shows for which you can buy tickets through Ticketmaster, which is part of Live Nation.\n\nOrpheum general manager Perry Blanchard, who was also a guest on the segment, counters: \"First of all, the ownership of the theater is still local. We have a booking arrangement, and the person that books our room books the House of Blues in Chicago, and Billboard's just put out a list yesterday of the top 25 clubs in America, and the House of Blues Chicago was number 5. And when we were looking for people to book our room, we had many conversations with a lot of promoters, and Live Nation came to us and they were the most realistic about what they expected from our venue. And the reason we went with Live Nation was because we want the ownership of this theater to stay local, and we need events in our room to keep it thriving, and they're driving so much business into our room right now that we couldn't be happier with their involvement. And ultimately, with what the Franks had coming down the pipe, we needed to have the best company to help us compete with what was coming down the line.\"\n\nBlanchard later adds: \"You can say what you want about Live Nation but they're the best at what they do, and we're certainly happy to have them on board with us.\"\n\nAnyhow, not entirely surprising to hear a business criticize a competitor, but it's a bit more heated than I would have expected.

{"id": 262, "ended": true, "length": 956, "text": "In a warming world, we expect to see increases in some extreme weather events. The science is pretty clear that in some parts of the world, drought and heat waves have and will continue to increase. In other areas, more severe storms along with precipitation and flooding have increased. Drought, heat waves, and floods are examples of changes to weather and climate patterns that will have costs for human society.\n\n\nIt's tricky to discern not only whether past extreme weather have changed, but also whether human-caused global warming is a factor. Scientists need high-quality records that go back many decades to see if there is any trend towards increasing or decreasing extreme weather. But weather is quite variable. We can see a rise or fall in extreme weather events with no apparent cause, human or natural.\n\n\nWhile these trends tend to be shorter (over days, weeks, or perhaps months), some trends can have longer durations. How can we identify trends prior to high-quality instrumentation and how can we discern whether the extreme weather we see now is within natural variability? Those are the questions addressed in a new publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research by lead author Dr. Benjamin Cook and his colleagues.\n\nThe title of the article, \"Spatiotemporal drought variability in the Mediterranean over the last 900 years\" clearly indicates that this study considers almost a millennium of drought records and focuses attention on the Mediterranean region.\n\nThe authors use a powerful database called the Old World Drought Atlas to look back in time prior to modern instruments. This atlas is a collection of tree-ring data that measures drought using the Palmer Drought Severity Index. Within the Mediterranean region, there are 106 different tree-ring datasets. These datasets go back various lengths of time but since 1100 CE, the region is accurately sampled.\n\n\nThe Palmer Drought Severity Index accounts for changes in precipitation as well as changes in evaporation and storage of water within soils. By using this measurement, the authors are able to find multiple droughts throughout the Mediterranean region. Often times, the droughts occur simultaneously in different parts of the region. For instance, droughts are likely to occur at the same in in both the Western Mediterranean (Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia) and in the east (e.g. Greece and Turkey).\n\nWhat did the authors find regarding the recent droughts in the Mediterranean? Well in recent decades, there has been a persistent and long-duration drought in the regions of Greece and the Levant region. The authors found that although the Greek droughts have been severe, they do not deviate from droughts that have been observed in the past.\n\nIn the Levant region, the recent drought (1998\u20132012) exceeds what they have seen in the past 900 years. In fact, the recent drought is likely the driest period in the last 900 years and very likely the driest period in the last 500 years.\n\nHere is what Dr. Cook told me:\n\nTo really understand the extent to which climate change is affecting extreme events, like droughts, you need to understand the full range of natural variability. This is why paleoclimate is so important - it gives us a way to extend our understanding way past the relatively short instrumental record of the last 100 to 150 years. In this study, we found that the recent drought in the Levant region of the eastern Mediterranean is likely worse than any comparable period of the last 900 years. This provides some independent support for other studies that have argued that climate change is intensifying drying in the region.\n\nTo be clear, this study doesn't prove that droughts are getting worse, and it doesn't prove that human emissions of greenhouse gases are making droughts more severe. In fact, proving such statements would be nearly impossible. What this study does is put recent extreme weather into historical context.\n\nWe know human carbon emissions will warm the world. We know that a warmer world affects precipitation and evaporation and this should affect droughts. We are observing that recent droughts are likely to worst on record. We also know that droughts and other extreme weather events have tremendous societal and economic consequences.\n\nWas the recent extreme Mediterranean drought caused by us? Probably. Or, if not caused by us, certainly made worse. Can we prove it? Probably not. However, it is clear to people like myself that study this topic that we have enough information to make decisions about the future planet we want to live in. It is clear that if we want to avoid further increases in extreme weather, we need to reduce our emissions of global-warming gases."}

He was praised by the press for \"flipping\" the property, built in 1940 by Mr. Trump's father Fred C. Trump, himself a real estate developer.\n\nThere is reason to fuss over the five-bedroom home. It could very well be declared a historic property, or become a lucrative tourist destination. There is always intrigue, though. Both the New York Times and New York Daily News note that the lawyer who represented the buyer \"is known to represent Chinese investors.\" If that proves to be true, there will be a media frenzy over a \"Chinese connection,\" or words to that effect \u2014 so stand by. Meanwhile, the property remains a cozy house, and Mr. Trump has publicly revealed that he still loves it.\n\n\"This property is so much more than just real estate; it's the childhood home of the 45th president of the United States, and it's a part of history. That intangible value makes it a perfect example of why special properties are appropriately sold by auction, just like art is.

For many of us who were marginalized, ignored, or demonized for the past eight years, this is an occasion for real joy, celebration, and yes, vindication. We have a president who gets it \u2014 he really gets it,\" Mr. Bast concludes.\n\nSPICER-ISM\n\nThe daily White House press briefing is an interesting showcase. On Tuesday, Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked about ongoing but unproven challenges to the Trump administration \u2014 \"you've got Russia, you've got wiretapping, there are investigations on Capitol Hill,\" one reporter noted.\n\n\"If the president puts Russian salad dressing on his salad tonight, somehow that's a Russian connection,\" Mr. Spicer responded, adding, \"I appreciate your agenda here.\"\n\nTHE SESSIONS ERA BEGINS\n\n\"The number of federal criminal prosecutions has declined for five consecutive years and is now at its lowest level in nearly two decades,\" writes John Gramlich, an analyst for the Pew Research Center who combed through new data from the federal courts. \"The decline comes as Attorney General Jeff Sessions has indicated that the Justice Department will reverse the trend and ramp up criminal prosecutions in the years ahead.\"\n\nIn fiscal year 2016, federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against 77,152 defendants, a decline of 25 percent since 2011, when 102,617 defendants were charged, and the lowest yearly total in two decades.

They exclude defendants whose cases were handled by magistrate judges.\n\n\"Prosecutions for drug, immigration and property offenses \u2014 the three most common categories of crime charged by the federal government \u2014 all have declined over the past five years,\" Mr. Gramlich says. \"The Justice Department filed drug charges against 24,638 defendants in 2016, down 23 percent from 2011. It filed immigration charges against 20,762 defendants, down 26 percent. And it charged 10,712 people with property offenses such as fraud and embezzlement, a 39 percent decline.\"\n\nThe analysts cite several factors for the trend, including then-Attorney General Eric Holder's direction in 2013 to federal prosecutors to ensure their cases \"serve a substantial federal interest.\" Mr. Sessions, meanwhile, has pushed to increase prosecutions for drug- and gun-related offenses to reduce violent crime, which has risen nationally since 2015 according to the FBI \u2014 though such crime is \"far below the levels recorded in the 1990s,\" Mr. Gramlich says.\n\nFOXIFIED\n\nSuccess continues for Fox News Channel, which"}

Clark, at that time pastor of the Second United Presbyterian Church, in Allegheny, and a clergyman of nearly eleven years' standing, at the close of his services on Sabbath, the 5th.of August, requested those of his congregation who were willing to enlist in the national armies, to meet him in the basement of the church on the following Monday evening. Many came, and in three days' time three companies were organized, of one of which, Mr. Clark was elected Captain.\n\nDrill was immediately,commenced at the Allegheny Commons, and in a little time ten full companies had been recruited, and a regimental organization effected with the following field officers:\n\nJohn B. Clark, Colonel\n\nFrederick Gast, Lieutenant Colonel\n\nHugh Danver, Major\n\nOn the 29th of August the regiment, a thousand strong, proceeded to Harrisburg, arriving at Camp Curtin on the morning of the 21st, where it was armed and equipped, and on the evening of the same day started for Washington. Upon its arrival it crossed the Potomac, and went into camp at Camp Stanton. Drill was at once resumed, schools for the instrnction of ofhicers were established, and the command soon became proficient in duty, eliciting on parade the compliments of its superior officers by its fine soldierly bearing. It was assigned to the Second Brigade,1 Third Division, Fifth Corps.\n\nOn the 29th of August, at the opening of the Second Bull Run battle, the regiment was moved out in the direction of Bailey's Cross Roads, and formed in picket line, with orders to suffer no person to pass through in either direction. For a day and a half this order was rigidly executed. But as the battle raged and increased in violence on the plains of Manassas, the Union army was borne back, and the broken and dispirited troops came pouring in, until they could be no longer held, the confused mass breaking through and moving on towards Washington, whither the division was soon afterwards ordered to follow.\n\nAt the Capital, the regiment exchanged its arms, Austrian muskets, with which it had at first been supplied, for Springfield rifles. On the morning of the 14th of September, the command started on the march through Maryland, and arrived near Frederick at night-fall of the 16th. Here the division remained during the 17th, under orders to cover Frederick from the direction of Harper's Ferry. At sunset it received orders to move to Antietam, and at the moment of receiving the orders the sound of battle was heard for the first time that day. The command was again put upon the march, and for the entire night, up and down the rugged way it was urged forward and at a little after sunrise on the following morning, was halted on the Antietam battle-field, a short distance from Sharpsburg.\n\nA renewal of the battle was momentarily expected, and the men, though worn out by forced marches, stood ready for the onset. The ground was strewn with the unburied dead. Hour after hour it waited, but no sound of battle came. Finally, it having been ascertained that the enemy had withdrawn the brigade was ordered to Shepherdstown Ford, where it was saluted by a few shots from the enemy's artillery, from the opposite shore, but suffered no, loss. At night it retired a mile back from the river, where it went into bivouac, and while it remained in Maryland, was studiously drilled and disciplined.\n\nWith the army it crossed the Potomac, and marched up, the Loudon Valley to Warrenton, where M'Clellan was relieved and Burnside put in command. From Warrenton the regiment marched to a point on Potomac Creek, four miles from Fredericksburg, where it went into camp and was engaged in drill and picket duty until the 12th of December, when it marched to the music of cannon towards Fredericksburg.\n\nOn the following day the battle opened, and at three P. M., after the corps of Hancock and French had been checked and terribly slaughtered, Humphreys' Division was ordered in. It was a forlorn hope, but gallantly it went forward, and charged again and again those impregnable heights. What brave men dare do, they did; but it was all in vain. No human power could stand against the storm that swept that fatal ground. The One Hundred and Twenty-third occupied a position in the line, with its right reaching nearly to the pike, and bore manfully its part in the battle, suffering grievously. Lieutenant James R. Coulter was among the killed, and Captain Daniel Boisol and Lieutenant George Dilworth among the mortally wounded. The entire loss was twenty-one killed, and one hundred and thirty-one wounded.

She leaves behind a series of audio tapes describing the \"13 reasons why\" she did it. The themes are graphic and intense, tackling not only suicide, but also sexual assault and underage drinking.\n\nNetflix\n\nNetflix says it's intended for mature audiences because of explicit and disturbing content, and it aims to provide an opening to difficult conversations. But educators and parents are concerned that \"13 Reasons Why\" might be glamorizing teen suicide, reports CBS News' Tony Dokoupil.\n\nThe program's portrayal of Hannah's story has prompted school districts across the country to send warning letters to parents, saying \"the show may be perceived as glorifying and romanticizing suicide.\"\n\n\"Suicide is a tough issue to talk about,\" said Dr. Christina Conolly. She works for Maryland's Montgomery County School District, where she helped write a letter which states \"adolescents watching without an adult ... could be at increased risk of self-harm.\"\n\n\"Watching a suicide or knowing someone who has died by suicide can lead others to completing a suicide themselves,\" Dr. Conolly explained.\n\nNetflix responded to the concerns in a statement, saying \"we gave the series a TV-MA rating, [and] added explicit warnings on the three most graphic episodes \u2026 we hope that \"13 Reasons Why\" can serve as a catalyst for conversation.\"\n\nRadio host Toby Knapp received a warning letter from his 13-year-old daughter Kyla's school, but only after she had already watched the series alone. \"It's caused her mom and I to say, 'OK, what is our daughter watching, what is she spending her screen time on?'\"\n\n\"I think it's all too real for most of the people my age to cope with and understand,\" Kyla said.\n\nMark Ralston / AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe series is designed to have an intense impact on viewers, according to executive producer Selena Gomez, who has struggled with depression herself. \"They have to see something that's going to shake them.

{"id": 272, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Most Americans who've followed the investigation into Hillary Clinton and her private email server fall into one of two camps. The first \u2014 those who believe the system is rigged and that she engaged in criminal acts but got away with them simply because her last name is Clinton. And the second \u2014 those who feel Hillary was the victim of yet another partisan witch-hunt that ended up being much ado about nothing, and that she's being harassed simply because she's a woman intent on breaking the highest \"glass ceiling\" of all.\n\nUndoubtedly congressional Republicans fall into the former group, so it was no surprise once the news broke that no criminal charges would be brought against Clinton that their first act would be to haul FBI Director James Comey in front of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to ask him for an explanation. Comey essentially argued that the applicable law \u2014 a 1917 statute based on \"gross negligence\" in mishandling classified information \u2014 wasn't actually applicable.\n\n\"No reasonable prosecutor would bring the second case in 100 years focused on gross negligence,\" testified Comey, a former U.S. attorney. \"That's just the way it is. I know the Department of Justice, [so] I know no reasonable prosecutor would bring this case.\" The case against Clinton, Comey added, did not meet the \"mens rea\" legal standard of criminal intent.\n\nYet one has to ask: What, then, was Hillary's intent? Perhaps it wasn't necessarily criminal intent, but there certainly was a lot of shady dealing going on between the Clinton Foundation, foreign leaders and others in the private loop with Hillary at the center. Even aside from the likelihood of hackers accessing the classified information on her private server, the reality that the Clintons used the secretary of state's office to peddle influence and thereby enrich themselves is outrageous. The personal email setup likely helped her cover-up Benghazi, too.\n\nInstead, the whole affair is chalked up to \"carelessness.\" As Comey pointed out: \"I see evidence of great carelessness, but I do not see evidence that is sufficient to establish that Secretary Clinton or those with whom she was corresponding both talked about classified information on email and knew when they were doing it that it was against the law.\" While Comey claims no \"reasonable\" prosecutor would bring charges, it's also true that one can indict a ham sandwich. Indeed, frivolous and politically motivated charges have often come from an overzealous prosecutor and a stacked grand jury bent on political mischief. (Former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy picks apart this defense from Comey by comparing it to a similar type of case where criminal negligence is often determined.)\n\nOr, taken the other way, how many who are accused of similar acts will now be using the \"Hillary defense\" to imply that they were only careless and had no criminal intent? One certainly could have lumped David Petraeus into that group had he been investigated post-Hillary.\n\nIt's more difficult to sit there with a straight face and assure Americans that the system isn't rigged, as Comey did, when two high-profile cases turn out so differently \u2014 to the benefit of the political party in power, no less. And when the top law-enforcement official in the country agrees to a secret meeting with the suspect's former-president husband, Comey's insistence that he \"did not coordinate \u2026 with anyone\" rings hollow.\n\nNo one in \"the White House, the Department of Justice, or anyone outside the FBI family had any idea what I was about to say,\" added Comey. \"I say that under oath, I stand by that. There was no coordination.\" We call bovine excrement on that: After all, why would Barack Obama be campaigning with Hillary on the very day she was cleared if he didn't know the fix was in? (Does anyone think a sitting president would share a stage with a politician who'd just been indicted?)\n\nComey didn't need to have a phone conversation with Attorney General Loretta Lynch or Obama or anyone else to know that Clinton was to be let off the hook. For one thing, Obama's been tipping the scales of justice since last spring, claiming during a \"60 Minutes\" interview that Clinton's malfeasance didn't pose \"a national security problem.\" The FBI director is appointed by the president, and serves at the pleasure of the president. Comey knew the score.\n\nThere may be a second chance to give Hillary her due, though. In his opening remarks for the House hearing, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), who chairs the Oversight Committee, asked Comey if the FBI investigation probed into Clinton's congressional testimony and whether she lied under oath. When it was learned Comey had not and was waiting on a referral from Congress to do so, Chaffetz assured Comey he will get one. While the case could be a slam dunk on the factual side, the problem may be in proving intent there as well. Republicans don't have a great record against Clinton perjury.\n\nIt will also be perceived, thanks to the mainstream media"}
{"id": 273, "ended": true, "length": 739, "text": "Armed Agorism: A three part series about obtaining and owning firearms through the Grey Market by guest contributor Atreidies. If you would like more background on Agorism, Black and Grey markets check this video .The following information is for educational purposes only. Please follow the advice in the article at your own risk.\n\nBuying firearms is a potentially risky endeavor. If you are reading this article at the original source, you probably already understand that there is a defacto registration system in place on the federal level. This is not supposed to be the case, but most people wouldn't doubt the inability of the federal government to let go of a voluntary data collection system that by law requires a purge after 24 hours, especially regarding something as potentially dangerous to their power structure as firearms in the hands of ordinary citizens.\n\nWhen buying from a federally licensed dealer (FFL), the purchaser fills out a form (4473) and the data collected on that form is either called in or entered electronically to check against a state or federal database, and the government decides if you can exercise your natural right to self-defense, or your enumerated and (supposedly) constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms. The law requires that this data be purged every 24 hours, and the reality is that this is likely true. HOWEVER, it's highly likely that the names and unique identifying information provided (SS Number, DOB, etc.) are added to a list of gun owners. There are ways to avoid having more \"hits\" on that list, or if you've never bought a gun through a licensed dealer, to never make it on the list in the first place.\n\nThe 4473's are kept on file for 25 years or longer with the FFL, even if they go out of business. If the ATF or any other agency does a trace on a gun, they will go to the manufacturer, which will eventually lead them to the FFL that did the original sale and has the 4473 on file. If it is your name on the form, it is your door they will be knocking on. This is why private transfers are a great Grey Market solution, because they are essentially a dead end for the investigator.\n\nPrivate transfers happen between two individuals, without the FFL process. The seller can be an FFL selling from his private collection. Some states require private transactions to go through an FFL, so purchases in these states should be avoided. There are several avenues to find a seller, which I will discuss later. More importantly, there are some things to avoid when buying from private individuals.\n\nFirst, don't use a social media account that is traceable to your real identity. Second, don't provide your state of residence if you are buying out of state. Third, don't mention that you are ineligible to possess a firearm if you are ineligible. It is a federal crime for an individual to KNOWINGLY sell to someone who resides out of state, or is ineligible. If you don't tell them, they won't know, and you aren't causing them to run afoul of the law without their consent. Most won't ask, and if they do, just drop all contact and move on. Giving false information can trap you in a setup. As a seller, if a buyer ever tells you they are from out of state or that they are ineligible, DO NOT SELL THEM THE FIREARM. This is potentially a setup, so just halt the transaction and walk. Maybe they're just ignorant of the law, but you don't want to take the chance."}

The tribes have announced they will be enforcing their own introduced ban on grizzly hunting on their territories along the BC north and central coasts, but hunters and hunting organizations say the ban is not legal and they will continue their grizzly hunts.\n\nIn 2012, The Coastal First Nations, a coalition of First Nations communities in British Columbia, proclaimed a grizzly bear hunt ban on their territory, regardless of the fact that it's sanctioned by the British Columbian provincial government, which continues to distribute trophy-hunting permits.\n\nThe resource director at the Guardian Watchmen and chief of the Kitasoo/Xai'xais Nation, Doug Neasloss, said \"Coastal Guardian Watchmen\" will be patrolling their lands to enforce the ban by telling hunters to stop and by scaring their prey away.\n\n\"We've been brought up to have respect for these animals and it's really unfortunate when people just come here and shoot these animals for sport. We like business to come to our territory, but there's some industries that are not accepted and not welcome, and trophy hunting is one of them.\" said Neasloss\n\nWhen grizzlies are trophy hunted, their heads are normally cut off, the body skinned and whatever of the carcass meat the hunters don't want is usually left behind.\n\nA BC provincial government spokesman said 300 grizzly bears in BC are killed each year in regulated hunts and that there are 15,000 grizzlies in the province - a figure disputed by conservation and animal rights groups. Canada's Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada says grizzlies are \"a special concern\" as they are \"particularly sensitive to human activities or natural events\".\n\nAlberta banned grizzly hunting in 2006, declaring the bear a threatened species.\n\nAlthough Neasloss said the First Nations' ban has reduced the number of grizzlies hunted each year and that many hunters have turned in their permits out of respect, experts say it is \"unlikely the big business of bear hunting\" will end anytime soon.\n\nOne company, Covert Outfitting, offers grizzly hunting excursions for $19,000. According to a Covert Outfitting spokesman, the number of grizzlies they hunt stays within limits set by the Government to sustain the bear population.\n\n\"Why do we personify an animal because it has a name and people take pictures of it?\" said the spokesman \"With grizzly bears, it's because they're beautiful and people think they're amazing, but if they were ugly and had no hair and killed people every day, everyone would want us to shoot them.\"\n\nHe added \"A lot of people think it's total insanity, but it's not. Maybe it's insanity living in the top of a skyscraper in downtown Vancouver, and having no idea what nature is or where our food comes from.\"\n\nHowever, Neasloss is confident they will win their fight for a ban on grizzly hunting, as he believes most British Columbians are against trophy hunting.\n\n\"I'm very hopeful that we're going to stop it. And I think the province needs to listen to us, to start listening to the people,\" he said."}

First, we wanted to be able to really experience a location, have enough time to visit all the sites. Second, we had recently returned from a week-long Disney Cruise and I observed that around day 5 or so, you start to notice this enveloping feeling of euphoria, a deeper stage of vacation relaxation; where you are comfortable enough with your surroundings that your mind no longer has to focus as much effort on learning and adapting, but instead can focus solely on enjoyment and time spent together as a family. At this stage, your trappings at home, work related stress and other concerns have been muted. Maybe some of these feelings were purposefully implanted by Disney, but in any case, I felt that there is more to gain from longer vacations and tapping into this emotional stage. Third, we love to travel and being able to do it for month would be fantastic. Fourth, we know that children that travel more are smarter, more socially aware, accepting and more easily adaptable. Now, we were faced with four major hurdles in order to accomplish this.\n\nHow do we afford such trips? How do we arrange for our kids to go on trips like this with us? How do I collect enough vacation time to take a month off? What do we do with our dog?\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles was the cost, but with some planning and scrimping, we were getting close, but it was taking a long time. Just after our 10 year wedding anniversary, I decided to upgrade Brooke's rings and she helped pick out her dream set. After having it resized and then trying it on, however, she decided that she would rather spend that money on our California trip and create family memories than to have a material possession such as this when she liked her current rings well enough. We eventually worked out the other hurdles and in 2015 began making travel plans and reservations for our first month-long trip, a road trip in California! The dates of the trip shifted slightly throughout planning and the direction in which we were traveling (we changed from South to North to North to South), but the winter and spring of 2016 had us heavily into travel planning and other arrangements. Finally, on June 21, 2016, we arrived at the Tampa Airport (TPA) and flew out to San Francisco (SFO) by way of Saint Louis (STL) on Southwest Airlines.

Half-Life 2, DOOM 3, Sims 2, Knights of the Old Republic II. Sure, they all look great, but we still like being a little surprised, and seeing something new at the big show. Thankfully, BioWare delivered today with an RPG that, although familiar, is something completely new at the same time.\n\nAlthough BioWare is probably best known for their Dungeons and Dragon's based Baldur's Gate series, Dragon Age isn't another foray into the D&D universe. As Joint-CEO Ray Muzyka told us, \"Dragon Age is the spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate.\" However, Dragon Age has nothing to do directly with Baldur's Gate.\n\nAlthough set against a traditional fantasy backdrop, BioWare is hoping to do something a little different with Dragon Age, and the world won't be inhabited by Dwarves, Elves and Halflings -- although it will be filled with Dwarf-like, Elf-like and Halfling-like races. While this may sound like a cop-out, Ray explained that BioWare wanted to try something a little different, but still wanted it to be familiar to fantasy RPG players. Although nothing is finalized at this point, Dragon Age will feature archetypal races and classes (you know, fighters, clerics, mages and the like), and BioWare is looking to the community to decide exactly which classes and races they want to see in the game. We did see one completely new race that will be in the game, though. Although they don't have a name as of yet, or at least BioWare wasn't saying what the name was, the characters sport horns on their heads and look rather lizard (or perhaps dragon) like.\n\nBioWare is known for their intensive research when building universes, and as with all their RPGs, BioWare strives to create an extremely deep and rich lore to go with their worlds. Dragon Age will be no exception, and they have already developed a backstory and culture for the playable races as well as the non-playable races in the game. BioWare even has a few linguistics PhD students developing entirely new languages for Dragon Age. When asked about the significance of the title, BioWare told us that, like the Stone Age and Iron Age, they wanted to indicate that the game takes place in a time where dragons are prevalent.\n\nLike most RPGs, in the beginning you'll create a party of characters and tailor them to your desire. You'll also be able to hire henchmen during the game, and BioWare promises you'll run into some characters with a lot of personality, like Minsc from Baldur's Gate."}

It's the only time that you are untethered from your body.\"\n\nHe's not alone in describing that untethered feeling as a potentially intense emotional experience. Your mind begins to run rampant. With nowhere else for thoughts to go, whatever problems, worries, or guilt sits in the back of your brain has to be confronted. As it's been put before, inside that tank, you have to face yourself.\n\n\"It can be uncomfortable in the sense that you really can't run away from any of the things that are subconsciously troubling you, but I love that,\" Rogan said. \"I'm not a big fan of running away from reality. I like handling all of the issues that bother me in order to go through life truly happy. There's a lot of people out there with ghosts, a lot of demons haunting their mind. In my opinion, this is your chance to face it head on and try to come up with a better path.\"\n\nBut a fear of facing oneself shouldn't be a deterrent to any type of therapy. Sensory deprivation has become a popular exercise throughout the world, with validated positive results that extend into everyday life. Namely stress and anxiety reduction, but also as an adjunct for chronic physical pain.\n\nDr. Darren Weissman, a holistic physician who has floated weekly since 1986, explains, \"I really feel that it's a result of floating and getting myself out of the way that I saw how all these multiple disciplines that activate the healing potentials of the body actually work together.\"\n\nFloating isn't just about facing the negative aspects of life. It's also about being more aware of, and appreciating the good. Letting the little, good moments simmer -- instead of just moving to the next thing -- helps them feel (and actually become) more real.\n\nAs Dr. Weissman says, it \"allows us to recognize our body's potentials. It opens us to a whole different level of awareness and of who we are. We start to notice things. It awakens consciousness.\"\n\nMatt Frederickson, an avid user of floatation tanks, says, \"Since I started doing it, I've become more calm, especially in my work life.\" A long-time sufferer of chronic neck, head, and back pain, Frederickson took his first float after hearing Joe Rogan's praise of the physical benefits of the isolation tank on Marc Maron's WTF podcast. \"I thought it sounded interesting because I personally suffer from a lot of chronic pain, so that's what initially drew me to it.\"\n\nFrederickson tried therapies for his chronic pain, a lot of which worked a little, but he's found that no other practice produces results as consistently effective as the isolation tank. But, like Rogan, he gets more out of it than he initially sought. \"I still use it mainly for the pain,\" he says. \"It really helps lessen that, but I think the secondary benefit, for me, would be the anxiety that's tied to the pain.\""}

For over a thousand years the sword was revered as the very soul of the samurai warriors who wielded it, commanding awe, respect, and an almost religious devotion. The tumultuous events of modern Japanese history and the nation's relentless drive toward technological advancement, however, irrevocably sealed the sword's fate, and, along with the samurai class, the sword became an anachronism, both culturally and militarily.\n\n\nAs Japan entered a period of unprecedented Imperial expansion in the early twentieth century, the Japanese sword, despite its limited practical effect, became a feature of the soldier's arsenal-an echo of the mythical status it enjoyed in feudal times. The Yasukuni swords emerged during the build-up to World War II, in part to help meet the huge demands of the Imperial Army, but more importantly out of a desire to preserve time-honored forging methods, and to revive the spirit of the samurai. For these reasons, they were notably distinct from so-called \"Showa-to,\" which were mass-produced and inferior in quality and artistry.\n\n\nAll swords were banned in the immediate aftermath of World War II, and the decades that followed have seen a decline in the popularity of Yasukuni swords, largely because of their associations with that war and the military. Another factor has been the stigma attached to Showa-to, which has helped to stereotype wartime swords in general.\n\n\nRecent years, however, have seen a renewed interest in the surviving Yasukuni swords. Many collectors and appraisers have acknowledged the workmanship of these swords as displaying a perfect blend of technology and tradition, and a quality that can rival even that of the great classical smiths.\n\n\nIn his tribute to the Yasukuni smiths, acclaimed photographer and sword enthusiast Tom Kishida has compiled an extensive study of these rare and exceptional swords, drawing on a variety of sources to shed light on this often little-understood chapter of Japanese sword history. With his unique eye for capturing the beauty of the blades in his photographs, he has provided the reader with the most lavishly detailed book on Yasukuni swords to date. This will be an important addition to the libraries of specialists and connoisseurs, and to those who wish to deepen their understanding of these fascinating wartime weapons.

(Photo: Otto Greule Jr, Getty Images)\n\nIn a postseason that began with more than a dozen former Tigers in the mix for a World Series ring, three still are standing.\n\nAnd two just happen to be among the best Tigers' draft picks of not just recent history, but all-time.\n\nJustin Verlander, the new ace of the Astros, and Curtis Granderson, an outfielder for the Dodgers, each will play in their third World Series when things get started Tuesday night \u2014 and each will be searching for their first World Series ring.\n\n\"No, no,\" Tigers general manager Al Avila said this week, when asked about his rooting interest \u2014 though it's worth noting, his father, Ralph, remains a consultant for the Dodgers, as does Tommy Lasorda, the godfather of Alex Avila. But his relationship with Verlander is deep, too. \"What I usually like in these series is that it goes seven and it's really exciting.\"\n\nHouston also has another former Tigers celebrated draft pick, outfielder Cameron Maybin, who had two stints in Detroit. But few Tigers have been celebrated by fans over the past dozen years like Granderson, a third-round draft pick out of the University of Illinois-Chicago in 2002, and Verlander, the No. 2 overall pick out of Old Dominion University in 2004.\n\nMore: Henning: Tigers seek bullpen relief down on the farm\n\nBy 2006, both were full-time, big-time contributors in Detroit, Granderson as the starting center fielder and Verlander as the ace of the staff, as the Tigers stunned baseball and \u2014 three years after losing an American League-record 119 games \u2014 made it all the way to the World Series.\n\nThat year not only marked the beginning of Tigers baseball renaissance, but also the start of two promising careers, one which should land Verlander, someday, in Baseball's Hall of Fame, and another which should at least get Granderson some consideration, depending on how much longer he plays.\n\nVerlander's 56.6 career WAR (Wins Above Replacement), per BaseballReference.com, is fourth-best ever among a player drafted and subsequently signed by the Tigers, while Granderson's 45.8 is fifth-best.\n\nThey are easily the two biggest draft successes in the Dave Dombrowski/Al Avila tenure, which began in November 2001. Nobody else comes close.\n\nIn the history of Tigers drafts \u2014 we're counting only June drafts here, not the now-defunct January draft \u2014 only Lou Whitaker (74.9, fifth round, 1975), Alan Trammell (70.4, second, 1976) and John Smoltz (69.5, 22nd, 1985) have gone one to accumulate higher career WARs than Verlander and Granderson.\n\nAnd Verlander, 34, is not anywhere close to being done adding to his career WAR, as he's shown in his nine-game run with the Astros. And Granderson, 36, probably isn't either, though he has struggled mightily in the couple of months since joining the Dodgers \u2014 so much so that he was left off the World Series roster, when the Dodgers announced their final 25 on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nMore: Dodgers leave slumping Granderson off World Series roster\n\nJustin Verlander is 4-0 with a 1.46 ERA and 24 strikeouts in 24.2 innings this postseason with the Houston Astros. (Photo: David J. Phillip, Associated Press)\n\nNO. 1 WITH A BULLET\n\nThe Tigers' first two first-round draft picks under the Dave Dombrowski-Avila era were total disasters. In 2002, Detroit selected a high-school shortstop from California named Scott Moore. In 2003, the Tigers took Wake Forest right-hander Kyle Sleeth. The two would combine to play 152 games in the major leagues, all by Moore, and none with the Tigers.\n\nWhen June 2004 rolled around, though, they were certain they had the man that could alter the franchise's fortunes. Other teams might have liked this guy or that guy. Verlander was no consensus. But the Tigers were all in on the lanky right-hander \u2014 and even better for them, they got word the Padres, with the No. 1 overall pick, planned to take a high-school infielder named Matt Bush with the No. 1 overall pick.\n\n\"I can tell you one thing,\" said Avila, \"Verlander was the guy we wanted.\"\n\nMore: Avila defends analytics department: 'We went from nothing'\n\nBush's story is well-documented.

University of Adelaide research has shown that when students are taught to train chickens their attitude to chickens changes. Learning that chickens are smarter than most people think, and that they can be trained, promotes much more positive attitudes towards the birds.\n\nThe research, published in the journal Animals, demonstrates a way of promoting more positive attitudes to animals. Through 'clicker training' chickens, students also learnt to train animals using 'force free' methods (encouragement rather than coercion) \u2500 important in future careers working closely with animals.\n\nThe study, with first-year School of Animal and Veterinary Science students at the University's Roseworthy campus, investigated the attitudes of the students before and after they had practical classes clicker-training chickens.\n\n\"We showed that attitudes to animals are linked to how clever we think that they are,\" says lead author Dr Susan Hazel, Senior Lecturer in Animal Behaviour in the School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences.\n\n\"When students learnt to clicker train the chickens \u2500 who pick up colour discrimination incredibly quickly \u2500 they were more likely to think that chickens are intelligent than before the class. The students were also more likely to think chickens can experience boredom, frustration and happiness.\n\n\"It was also a very effective class for teaching students the basics of animal training, and a number of students have told me afterwards how they have used that information in training their own animals.\"\n\nThe students paired clickers with food, so the chickens learnt the click meant they have done what was wanted and would be rewarded.\n\nThe students' first task was to get the chickens to peck on a red target. This behaviour was 'shaped', meaning initially the chicken was clicked and rewarded immediately with food when it looked at the target. Progressively rewards were only given when the chicken got closer, and closer, until it actually pecked the target. Chickens soon learnt colour discrimination. They learnt to peck on the red target, rather than green or yellow.\n\n\"Animals learn all of the time, even when we are not deliberately training them,\" says Dr Hazel. \"Understanding how they learn is integral to being able to manage or train animals effectively.\n\n\"Chickens are descendants of wild jungle fowl, and to survive had to learn quickly what food was good to peck at and what they should ignore. The students not only learnt about how to train an animal, but they learnt chickens are much smarter they had realised, changing their views of chickens forever.\"\n\nExplore further: Bird flu losses likely to top 20M with new cases in Iowa\n\nMore information: \"'Chickens Are a Lot Smarter than I Originally Thought': Changes in Student Attitudes to Chickens Following a Chicken Training Class.\" Animals 2015, 5, 821-837.

{"id": 287, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "As it evolved, somatization became a way to think about and classify unexplained symptoms. The word somatization fell out of favor because it always implied psychogenicity. It was an hypothesis that was often inconsistent with observed data, and was mired in different schools of psychiatric thought and argument. For better or worse, it lacked face validity to many physicians. Still, it stayed around because it described common symptoms and situations that didn't fit in otherwise and which, at some level, made at least a little sense. In a previous post, John Quinter writes disparagingly of somatization: It 'in fact only reflects the medical observer's \"psychologization\" of the clinical problem.' John's comment exposes the opposition to somatization and a psychosocial basis for fibromyalgia. Dan Clauw, together with a group of truly expert co-authors, writes\n\nIn the final analysis, physical versus psychologic distinctions regarding unexplained symptoms might rest on preconception and perspective rather than a priori hypothesis testing. Historically, observers of syndromes of unexplained symptoms have often drawn differing conclusions from like presentations. Whereas some observers have preferred to see a common physiological mechanism that explains symptoms, others have postulated common psychologic traumas ranging from childhood abuse to current stressors. Still others have invoked the tendency for some individuals to seek relief from social predicaments and for some clinicians and scientists to derive novel illnesses that accommodate them.1\n\nBeginning at the end of the 20th, a clearer recognition of the limitations of the somatization concept was acknowledged. Sharpe wrote in 2006 'The assumptions that (a) bodily pathology can always explain bodily symptoms, (b) psychopathology can always explain bodily symptoms in the absence of bodily pathology, and (c) dichotomizing bodily symptoms into biomedical and psychiatric types is clinically useful were all found to have questionable validity and utility.2 He wrote further that 'Alternative multiaxial diagnostic approaches for the classification of bodily symptoms are proposed. These are intended to (a) give greater prominence to bodily symptoms in their own right, (b) allow etiology to be conceptualized in terms of multiple factors, and (c) provide the basis for integrating medical and psychiatric approaches to patient care.\n\nSuch ideas are also found in the designation of illnesses like fibromyalgia and similar disorders as `somatic syndromes disorders,' 'physical symptom disorders,' 'functional symptoms disorders,' 'somatic and multisomatic symptom disorders.' It became clear that the line between psychiatric conditions and physical ones was difficult to draw, and as Sharpe said, etiology should be to be 'conceptualized in terms of multiple factors.'\n\n'Somatization' was also confounded by the specialties that invoked it. The psychiatrists clearly had in mind a psychiatric disorder\u2014the type of illness that I never saw in my patients with fibromyalgia. The primary care physician input, led by the careful, thoughtful and ultimately very helpful work of Kurt Kroenke and others in his group, noted that somatic symptoms were ubiquitous and mostly transitory. Rheumatologists saw a different pattern in chronic pain patients: persistent increased numbers of somatic symptoms and symptom severity.\n\nKroenke developed as series of Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ) that identified those with many somatic symptoms, and he couched descriptive language in non-psychiatric terms. In 1997 he wrote, 'For clinical or research use in primary care, the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for somatization disorder are too restrictive, while the criteria for un- differentiated somatoform disorder are overly inclusive. In this article, we examine the validity of multisomatoform disorder, defined as 3 or more medically unexplained, currently bothersome physical symptoms plus a long (\u22652 years) history of somatization.'3 In 2012, he developed an 8-item question that could be used together with the (disputed) DSM-5 Somatic Symptom Disorder. The items included GI-GU problems, back pain, joint and muscle pain, headaches, chest pain, dizziness, fatigue, trouble sleeping. It is a veritable checklist for fibromyalgia, but is neutral as to psychogenicity\u2014as was the multisomatoform disorder.\n\nWithout intending it, the 2010 ACR fibromyalgia made clear the prominence of somatic symptoms in fibromyalgia. Given multiple painful regions, the diagnosis of fibromyalgia is dependent on somatic symptoms. Maybe, as some have suggested, fibromyalgia should be considered as a kind of somatic pain disorder. Noll-Hussong in 2011 used the term, 'Pain-predominant multisomatoform disorder.'4 Not a bad phrase for fibromyalgia, to my mind.\n\nCollecting data on the number (or the number and severity) of somatic symptoms provides insights into fibromyalgia. Symptoms increase with age; people with fibromyalgia report many more symptoms than non-fib"}

New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1909. This story is found on page 242. Remarkably, the book is still available in an edition from the University of Michigan Press. More convenient for us, the University of Michigan has the entire text on-line, in the Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, an on-line source whose whole text is searchable.\n\nHowever, Lincoln does not tell the story about a dog \u2014 he uses a calf.\n\nRice's book is a collection of reminiscences of others, exactly as the title suggests. Among those doing the reminiscing are ex-president and Gen. U. S. Grant, Massachusetts Gov. Benjamin Butler (also a former Member of Congress), Charles A. Dana the editor and former Assistant Secretary of War, and several others. In describing Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation, George W. Julian relates the story. Julian was a Free-Soil Party leader and a Member of Congress during Lincoln's administration. Julian's story begins on page 241:\n\nFew subjects have been more debated and less understood than the Proclamation of Emancipation. Mr. Lincoln was himself opposed to the measure, and when he very reluctantly issued the preliminary proclamation in September, 1862, he wished it distinctly understood that the deportation of the slaves was, in his mind, inseparably connected with the policy. Like Mr. Clay and other prominent leaders of the old Whig party, he believed in colonization, and that the separation of the two races was necessary to the welfare of both. He was at that time pressing upon the attention of Congress a scheme of colonization in Chiriqui, in Central America, which Senator Pomeroy espoused with great zeal, and in which he had the favor of a majority of the Cabinet, including Secretary Smith, who warmly indorsed the project. Subsequent developments, however, proved that it was simply an organization for land-stealing and plunder, and it was abandoned; but it is by no means certain that if the President had foreseen this fact his preliminary notice to the rebels would have been given. There are strong reasons for saying that he doubted his right to emancipate under the war power, and he doubtless meant what he said when he compared an Executive order to that effect to \"the Pope's Bull against the comet.\" In discussing the question, he used to liken the case to that of the boy who, when asked how many legs his calf would have if he called its tail a leg, replied, \" Five,\" to which the prompt response was made that calling the tail a leg would not make it a leg.\n\nI believe it is fair to call the story \"confirmed.\" It's not an exact quote, but it's an accurate story.\n\nPlease share:\n\nAdvertisements"}

From the mid-19th century through the mid-20th, this was the common term for the vehicles in which police hauled convicts and arrestees to jails, courts and prisons. Consider, now, the origin of the term. The \"paddies\" were Irish immigrants, who were flocking to the United States in the 1840s and '50s, fleeing the great famine that had descended on Ireland. And the Irish, some right-thinking Protestant Americans believed, were inherently a criminal bunch.\n\nIn the 1840s and '50s, there were enough of those right-thinking Americans to form a political party: the American Party, they called it, though (because when asked about their doings, many apparently paranoid members responded, \"I know nothing\") it soon came to be known as the Know Nothings. With Irish and German immigrants flooding into the country (the Germans largely fleeing the repression that followed the failed revolutions of 1848), the Know Nothings experienced a brief surge of popularity until the far greater conflict between slave states and free states led to a more fundamental reshuffling of political parties. Some Know Nothings drifted into the ranks of the newly formed Republican Party. One early GOP leader, Abraham Lincoln, did everything he could to squelch their influence and make clear that German, Irish and all other immigrants were welcome additions to the party and the nation.\n\nLike most immigrant groups, the Irish took the hardest, most thankless jobs \u2014 building railroads, for instance. Nonetheless, the nativist leaders of the time \u2014 the 1850s version of Fox News chief Roger Ailes \u2014 insisted that guys with names like Hannity and O'Reilly were inherently disposed to crime and violence, undeterred by the absence of data that backed up their claims.\n\n'Twas ever thus. Italians were criminals or anarchists; Jews were criminals (as in \"The Great Gatsby\") or communists; Mexicans, if you believe Donald Trump, are rapists and murderers. Never mind, as a recent voluminous study by the National Academy of Sciences makes clear, that the linkage between immigrants and crime is not merely fictitious but actually inverse: After close statistical analysis, the study concludes, \"Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates.\" Based on the findings of at least 30 academic papers, the study concludes that foreign-born young men have an incarceration rate that is one-fourth that of native-born, and that \"neighborhoods with greater concentrations of immigrants have lower rates of crime and violence\" than other socioeconomically equivalent neighborhoods.\n\nIndeed, the growing number of the foreign-born over the past quarter-century goes a long way to explaining the huge drop in crime and violence that the nation has experienced during that time. The number of murders in New York City dropped from 2,245 in 1990 to 328 last year; in Los Angeles County it fell from 1,944 in 1993 to 551 last year, even as the number and share of their foreign-born residents skyrocketed. Nationally, in 2014 violent crime rates were at their lowest level in 20 years, according to the FBI.\n\nThe immigrant crime wave that right-wing media and many Republican politicians rail about, then, is either a figment of their imaginations or an article of faith that, whatever their individual beliefs, they seek to instill or inflame in their followers. These beliefs are as valid as their predecessors' claims that the Irish or the Chinese, say, posed a danger to the United States and that no more of them should be allowed in. They are in the grand tradition of Madison Grant's hugely influential 1916 book \"The Passing of the Great Race,\" which argued that the \"Nordics\" of Northwestern Europe were a superior race to Southern and Eastern Europeans (Italians, Jews, Greeks et al.), and that immigration from anyplace other than Northwest Europe should be banned. In 1924, Congress did just that, enacting a law that effectively restricted immigration from all but the \"Nordic\" nations, a law that stayed on the books until the Great Society Congress of 1965 repealed it.\n\nSo to those who want to repeal birthright citizenship and send those dangerous Mexicans back to their homeland: Why stop there? Donald Trump's claims about the dangers posed by Mexicans are no more valid than Madison Grant's about the Italian and Jewish menace, or the Know Nothings' about the criminal tendencies of the Irish. Deporting the Gonzalezes makes sense only if we also deport the O'Reillys and the Hannitys and, yes, the Meyersons. See you all, ladies and gentlemen, on some distant shore.\n\nRead more from Harold Meyerson's archive or follow him on Twitter."}

{"id": 295, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground: Previous studies have demonstrated that methamphetamine abuse leads to memory deficits and these are associated with relapse. Furthermore, extensive evidence indicates that nicotine prevents and/or improves memory deficits in different models of cognitive dysfunction and these nicotinic effects might be mediated by hippocampal or cortical nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The present study investigated whether nicotine attenuates methamphetamine-induced novel object recognition deficits in rats and explored potential underlying mechanisms. Methods: Adolescent or adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received either nicotine water (10\u201375 \u03bcg/mL) or tap water for several weeks. Methamphetamine (4\u00d77.5mg/kg/injection) or saline was administered either before or after chronic nicotine exposure. Novel object recognition was evaluated 6 days after methamphetamine or saline. Serotonin transporter function and density and \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density were assessed on the following day. Results: Chronic nicotine intake via drinking water beginning during either adolescence or adulthood attenuated the novel object recognition deficits caused by a high-dose methamphetamine administration. Similarly, nicotine attenuated methamphetamine-induced deficits in novel object recognition when administered after methamphetamine treatment. However, nicotine did not attenuate the serotonergic deficits caused by methamphetamine in adults. Conversely, nicotine attenuated methamphetamine-induced deficits in \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density in the hippocampal CA1 region. Furthermore, nicotine increased \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density in the hippocampal CA3, dentate gyrus and perirhinal cortex in both saline- and methamphetamine-treated rats. Conclusions: Overall, these findings suggest that nicotine-induced increases in \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex might be one mechanism by which novel object recognition deficits are attenuated by nicotine in methamphetamine-treated rats.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMethamphetamine (METH) abuse is a significant public health problem with annual prevalence rate of abuse in 2013 in >1% of adolescents and young adults (Johnston et al., 2014). Extensive clinical evidence indicates that METH abuse causes significant neurocognitive deficits (Kalechstein et al., 2003, 2009; Gonzalez et al., 2004; Hoffman et al., 2006; Cherner et al., 2010; Casaletto et al., 2014). For example, episodic memory is reduced among participants with a history of METH abuse (approximately 11 years), as assessed by performance in learning and recall tests (Casaletto et al., 2014). METH users also present with deficits in learning, motor ability, and working memory tests (Cherner et al., 2010). Neurocognitive deficits occur not only in individuals currently using METH (Simon et al., 2000) but can also persist long after METH is discontinued (4 days to 7 months) (Kalechstein et al., 2003, 2009; Gonzalez et al., 2004; Hoffman et al., 2006; Cherner et al., 2010; Casaletto et al., 2014). Among the different types of neurocognitive deficits caused by METH abuse, METH-associated neurocognitive deficits are greater for episodic memory, executive functions, information processing speed, and motor skills and lesser for attention, working memory, and verbal fluency (Scott et al., 2007). Notably, relapse is associated with episodic memory deficits but not other types of cognitive dysfunction among METH abusers (Simon et al., 2004).\n\nIn addition to its impact on cognition, METH abuse causes brain abnormalities in areas important for memory, such as the hippocampus and cortex. For example, Thompson et al. (2004) reported that METH abusers have 7.8% smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects as assessed by MRI, and these deficits correlated with deficits in deficits on a word recall task. The integrity of hippocampal and cortical neurons can also be assessed by the binding of the serotonin transporter (SERT), a marker highly expressed in these neuronal regions (Lawrence et al., 1993; for review, see Meneses et al., 2011). Loss of presynaptic serotonergic markers such as SERT indicates loss of this population of presynaptic serotonergic terminals. Studies have reported significant loss of serotonergic markers in the hippocampus and cortex of individuals with cognitive dysfunction, such as in METH abuse or Alzheimer's disease (Chen et al., 1996; Sekine et al., 2006; Ouchi et al., 2009). For example, positron emission tomography scan revealed that SERT densities are reduced in several brain regions of abstinent METH abusers (Sekine et al., 2006).\n\nNovel object recognition (NOR) is an established preclinical model for evaluating recognition memory deficits (for review, see Kinnavane et al., 2014). This test relies on the instinct of rats to preferentially explore novel objects over familiar objects, thus requiring the animals to remember which object is familiar. The perir"}

No one is going to do anything big or risky. The pace of action is neither chaotic nor energetic but just shy of slipping on a Snuggie and settling in for a Lord of the Rings marathon.\n\nThis is, of course, pathetic. Republicans and Democrats are both so frightened about creating fights within their own parties during an election year that they are leaving the big questions unanswered. Today, House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp put forward a set of fundamental tax reform proposals. It was the product of years of work between Camp, a Republican, and his Democratic counterpart in the Senate, Max Baucus. The two traveled across the country holding hearings, taking in mountains of input, and engaging in all the other kinds of activity that most people like to think of when they think of elected representatives doing their jobs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nAll that work is going nowhere. No one in either party wants to risk taking on the complicated and tricky issue that might offend big contributors or stir up voters in the wrong way. There will continue to be talk on both sides, but no one is going to get anything done. Budget expert Stan Collender thinks that means no action on this issue until 2019.\n\nThe pace of action in Washington is just shy of slipping on a Snuggie and settling in for a Lord of the Rings marathon.\n\nTrade and immigration are two other items that have gone from the back burner to the freezer. House Speaker John Boehner won't start a fight in his party by bringing up immigration reform, and President Obama won't force his party to take up trade legislation that the president says will help the economy.\n\nThe stakes are so low in Washington that Obama and Boehner could even sit down and meet again after a long pause. Tuesday, the two men talked for an hour in what was their longest noncrisis conversation in years. Boehner emerged calling it a \"nice meeting\" and then went back to beating up on the president and his health care law.\n\nSo if nothing is going to get done, what did they talk about? Well, just because no one in Washington is going to do anything big or meaningful doesn't mean they have totally banished their chance to do a little something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nThere is a possibility that the appropriations process will actually take place in some form this year. Spending items may actually be considered by a committee in which people will have their say about the merits of each program. Although the big budget questions of our time\u2014big new spending or entitlement reforms\u2014are still out of the conversation, at least spending levels won't be determined by sequestration. There's also a slim chance that Congress might work together on the transportation bill, flood insurance, and a water resource bill in the way that members worked together to pass the farm bill.\n\nThose are not grand pieces of legislation, but they are what one top congressional aide calls the \"meat and potatoes\" of operating a government. A cynic might also call them the least lawmakers can be expected to do and still deserve the name. Of course, even limited progress is the optimistic view. Though the temperature has lowered and chaos is on pause, it's still possible that lawmakers could slip from risk-free coasting to a full-on coma. Given how few legislative days are scheduled for this election year, it may be impossible even to handle the meat-and-potato basics. Congress may, for example, once again resort to passing a continuing resolution instead of having a proper appropriations process."}

Free chicken is already the standard: All they have to do is find a restaurant willing to match and get it to toss in unlimited dipping sauces.\n\nI can't tell you how many free-agency coups I suspect have been decided by an extra cup of ranch or another meal-time dressing.

T-Mobile was asked to do so by a local music rights group, who want the ISP to voluntarily follow a court order that was issued against rival Internet provider A1.\n\nAs the poster-child of online piracy, The Pirate Bay has become one of the most censored websites on the Internet in recent years.\n\nMost recently the Austrian Internet provider A1 was ordered by the Commercial Court of Vienna to block subscriber access to The Pirate Bay.\n\nIn addition to various domain names of the notorious torrent site, the court order also requires the Internet provider to block three other \"structurally infringing\" sites; Isohunt.to, 1337x.to and h33t.to.\n\nTaking advantage of this momentum, local music rights group LSG sent its lawyers after several other large ISPs urging them to follow suit, or else.\n\nA letter with a 'demand' to block The Pirate Bay and others was sent T-Mobile and Drei, among others. However, without a court order directed at them the providers are not all eager to comply.\n\nHelmut Spudich, spokesman for T-Mobile, says that his company has no plans to implement new blocking measures. \"We will not to comply with this request and access to The Pirate Bay will not be blocked,\" Spudich told Futurezone.\n\nThe decision of the Commercial Court of Vienna only applies to A1, so T-Mobile sees no legal obligation to comply with the request.\n\nInstead, T-Mobile notes that the authorities \"should implement clear legal regulations with regard to Internet blocking in Austria.\"\n\n\"We don't want to block our customers to be blocked inadvertently and would like a clarification on the correct procedure,\" Spudich adds.\n\nSeveral other Austrian Internet providers have received the same letter but thus far none have publicly stated that they are prepared to voluntarily block The Pirate Bay on their network.\n\nThe Pirate Bay is not the first site to be targeted in Austria. Earlier this year the Supreme Court ordered several leading Austrian ISPs to block the major streaming sites Movie4K.to and Kinox.to.\n\nThis order also clarified that the Internet providers will have to pay the costs for future blockades, which may make ISPs more hesitant to comply without protest.\n\nWhether copyright holders will indeed take T-Mobile and other ISPs to court to broaden the existing blockade has yet to be seen.\n\nUpdate August 28: According to Futurezone none of the large ISPs have started to voluntarily block the Pirate Bay before the ultimatum they were given."}
{"id": 301, "ended": true, "length": 779, "text": "Is the PHI on all your mobile devices encrypted? If not, here's another two million reasons to make encryption your top priority. The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) of the Department of Health and Human Services announced on April 22, 2014 that they had imposed nearly $2 million in penalties on two entities as a result of the theft of unencrypted laptops.\n\nAs previously noted in this blog, theft or loss of laptops or other portable electronic devices remains a predominant factor in HIPAA breaches, constituting 57.5% of the approximately 400 List Breaches that involved reported theft or loss as of August 2013.\n\nIn the first incident, Concentra Health Services was fined $1,725,220 and agreed to adopt a corrective action plan after an OCR investigation following a report of the theft of an unencrypted laptop from a physical therapy clinic. According to the press release,\n\n\"OCR's investigation revealed Concentra had previously recognized in multiple risk analyses that a lack of encryption on its laptops, desktop computers, medical equipment, tablets and other devices containing electronic protected health information (ePHI) was a critical risk. While steps were taken to begin encryption, Concentra's efforts were incomplete and inconsistent over time leaving patient PHI vulnerable throughout the organization. OCR's investigation further found Concentra had insufficient security management processes in place to safeguard patient information.\"\n\nThis isn't Concentra's first experience with laptop theft. The OCR list of Breaches Affecting 500 or More Individuals (also known as the \"Wall of Shame\") includes two prior similar incidents, one in 2009 and another in 2011. (It is unclear whether this theft was related to the 2011 incident). Modern Healthcare reports that Concentra reported 16 additional breaches involving fewer than 500 individuals' records. So, although 434 out of 597 laptops had been encrypted according to HealthITSecurity.com, a batting average of .726 wasn't good enough given their status as repeat offenders. Concentra's resolution agreement, including the Corrective Action Plan, is available here and is worth reading. Among other conditions, OCR requires that the company provide an update regarding its encryption status, including the percentage of all Concentra devices and equipment (laptops, desktops, medical equipment, tablets, and other storage devices) that are encrypted and an explanation for the percentage of devices and equipment that are not encrypted.\n\nThe company's incomplete and inadequate implementation of compliance steps after known vulnerabilities had been identified may also have contributed to the severity of the penalty. One of the worst things a covered entity or business associate can do is to engage in a half-hearted compliance effort that documents knowledge of uncorrected problems.\n\nIn the second case, Arkansas-based QCA Health Plan reported the theft of an unencrypted laptop containing records of 148 individuals. OCR noted that its investigation revealed that QCA failed to comply with multiple requirements of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, beginning from the compliance date of the Security Rule in April 2005 and ending in June 2012. QCA agreed to pay $250,000 and implement upgraded security procedures and employee training. QCA's Resolution Agreement and Corrective Action Plan is here. This case marks only the second time OCR has fined an entity for a breach involving less than 500 individuals' PHI, following the Hospice of North Idaho settlement.\n\nOne lesson is clear from both incidents: if these laptops had been encrypted in accordance with NIST standards, neither entity would have been subjected to fines and additional government oversight. As enforcement continues to ramp up and target both Covered Entities and Business Associates, and as the use of mobile devices continues to increase, there is no excuse to delay full implementation of encryption. Encryption isn't a panacea, but it's as close as you can get in the HIPAA compliance world."}

It thus avoids polluting the global environment.\n\nSince modules are environments, a module's content can be listed easily via ls(modulename) , and R shells provide auto-completion when writing modulename$ and pressing Tab repeatedly.\n\nModules can be executed directly (via Rscript module.r or similar) or import ed. Unlike via source , a module knows when it's being import ed, which allows code to be executed conditionally only when it is executed directly: if (is.null(module_name())) { \u2026 } This is of course similar to Python's if __name__ == '__main__': \u2026 mechanism. module_name returns a module's name. Module source files which are being executed directly don't act as modules and hence have no name ( module_name() is NULL ).\n\nModules can import other modules relative to their own path, without having to chdir to the module's path (similar to the source option chdir=TRUE , but preserving getwd() ).\n\nimport uses a standardised, customisable search path to locate modules, making it easy to reuse source files across projects without having to copy them around.\n\nRepeatedly import ing, even in different modules, loads the module only once. This makes it particularly well-suited for structuring projects into small, decomposable units. This project was mainly borne out of the frustration that is repeatedly source ing the same file, or alternatively having one \"master header\" file which includes all other source files.\n\nDoc comments inside a module source file are parsed during import , and interactive help on module contents is subsequently available via the usual mechanisms (e.g. ?mod$fun ).\n\nAll module source files are assumed to be encoded as UTF-8, which is nowadays the only sane default.\n\nPackages ( library )\n\nModules are conceived as a lightweight alternative to packages (see rationale). As such, modules are generally intended to be more lightweight than packages.\n\nMost importantly, modules often consist of single source code files.\n\nModules do not need a DESCRIPTION file or similar.\n\nModules offer more stringent protection against name clashes. While attaching to the R search() path is supported, it's not the default, and (like in Python), it's generally discouraged in favour of explicitly qualifying accesses to the module with the module name (or an alias).\n\nChanging a module does not necessitate a module reinstall, the changes are available directly to clients (and even to running sessions, via reload ).\n\nModules can be local to a project. This allows structuring projects internally, something that packages only allow at coarse level. In particular, modules can be nested as in Python to create hierarchies, and this is in fact encouraged.\n\nAs of now, there is no support for non-R code or dynamic libraries (but one may of course use facilities such as dyn.load and Rcpp to include compiled code).\n\nControl over exported and imported symbols is less fine-grained than for packages with namespace for now. This is intentional, since modules handle namespaces (via environments) more stringently than packages by default. However, this might still change in the future to allow more control.\n\nPython's import mechanism\n\nR modules are heavily inspired by Python modules, but embedded in R syntax."}

{"id": 306, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "\"Did you know you can actually negotiate and get a better deal at the doctor's office if you offer to pay up front?\" co-founder and CEO of Collective Health Ali Diab asks.\n\nHe'd broken his foot and had to go to the doctor for an MRI that would have cost him $3,700, with a $1,500 deductible. Instead it cost just $600 in cash that day. He says that's because he paid for it without going through his insurance provider. This is part of what gave him the idea for Collective Health, a new Founders Fund-backed employer health program launching today. It promises to take the paperwork and runaround out of health insurance.\n\nDiab and co-cofounder Dr. Rajaie Batniji, a physician and political economist at Stanford University, paint Collective Health as a way to cut out the middleman (health insurance) and instead offer employers a less expensive, cloud-based, a la cart version of health care coverage for their workers. Employers can pick and choose which things they want covered for their employees. \"We're not building another health app or gadget. We're building a complete solution to replace your employer provided health insurance,\" says Diab.\n\nFounders Fund led an undisclosed Series A to back the idea. Formation 8, the Social+Capital Partnership, and prominent angel investors including Scott Banister, Max Levchin, Jeremy Stoppelman and Amr Awadallah also added money in support.\n\nThe other part for the idea for Collective Health was first planted when Diab's intestine suddenly twisted up on itself, cutting off the blood supply to about 10 feet of his intestine. \"Nothing could have prevented or predicted this. It was just bad luck,\" says Diab.\n\nTo have that happen is a scary and life threatening experience. And then, just as he was struggling to regain his strength, his health insurer didn't want to pay his fees. Diab says he'd been paying for premium coverage for years in the event of something like this happening. Instead of the help he needed, he was left with papers up to his gut in legalese and medical insurance loop-de-loops he didn't understand. It was either pay up or face legal action, ruined credit and further unnecessary hardship.\n\nDiab's story is not unique. Dr. Batniji has seen it over and over again while working in the medical field. \"Patients are often left to advocate for themselves and trying to get a clear answer from your health insurance company about what's driving costs is impossible,\" says Dr. Batniji. According to NerdWallet, one in every 5 American adults are struggling to pay their medical bills, and three in five bankruptcies will be due to medical bills. And to add more insult to any possible injuries, over the last 10 years, the average premium for family coverage has increased 80 percent, according to ACA International. It was a 90 percent increase from 2008 to 2009, according to data provided from Wellpoint, Cigna and United Health (see chart below).\n\nThe problem, according to Diab and Dr. Batniji, is that even with Obamacare or employee sponsored health insurance, annual premiums are increasing. They say the costs are growing at an unsustainable rate for most small and midsize companies to handle. This, according to Diab, makes it hard to offer a good plan for employees. \"While insurance is supposed to be a risk\u00ad-sharing business, health insurance has increasingly become a middleman business devised to generate profit for the health insurers above all else. As a result, there is a fundamental disconnect between the incentives of traditional health insurance companies and people's and organizations' health insurance needs,\" says Diab.\n\nDiab and Dr. Batniji started asking questions like \"Why have insurance premiums and deductibles risen so much faster than underlying health care costs over the past twenty years?\" and \"Why do we receive something in the mail after seeing the doctor that looks like a bill, but says 'THIS IS NOT A BILL' at the top?\" \"It's like entering a time warp back to 1980,\" Diab says. Several long bike rides and early morning coffees later, Dr. Batniji and Diab decided it was up to them to figure out a better way to fixing how Americans pay for health care.\n\nThe startup now employs 25 people in a San Mateo office and Collective Health is currently \"renting\" insurance services off of a certain network that it is not at liberty to name at this time. Payments processing is also in the works and Diab says it will eventually be like a square or pay pall software. Collective Health also adds in cost comparisons and which doctors are in your network. It also includes a data visualization element not currently offered by any health insurance provider. The data shows you how much you can expect to pay, above your premium. This, says Diab, better prepares someone for what it should cost than just mailing something"}
{"id": 307, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Whoring is like military service\u2026okay in the upper brackets, not so good lower down. \u2013 Robert A. Heinlein\n\nMany Americans like to pretend that all prostitutes are streetwalkers. I say \"pretend\" because, though I am sure there are some ill-informed folks out there who simply don't know any better, I am equally sure the vast majority of people in this country know of the existence of call girls, escorts, massage parlor girls, brothel girls, lawyers and other types of prostitutes. Yet, even so, say \"prostitute\" to the average American and the picture that will pop into his (or her) mind is the stereotypical underdressed, overly made up streetwalker leaning against a lamp post and smoking a cigarette. Ignore for a minute that this stereotype isn't even true of many streetwalkers; the real question is, why? How is it that the word \"prostitute\", broad and clinical as it is, has come to mean for most Americans only those women at the very bottom of our profession? I can't be sure of all the reasons, but I have some educated guesses I would like to share with you.\n\nFirst and foremost, of course, is that streetwalkers are ubiquitous. To my knowledge no one has ever done a world census of whores, but The National Task Force on Prostitution estimates that, of the entire female prostitute community in America, only five to twenty percent are street walkers (that's an average estimate of 12.5%, so let's be generous and say 15%). And unlike the brothel girls and massage girls (who are only encountered in their own places of business) or call girls and escorts (who are difficult to tell apart from other women), streetwalkers stand out; they're hard to miss when they're present. Since they have no advertising and/or place of business, how else could they attract clientele? They have to be visible, and they have to advertise their profession so as not to be overlooked. Hence, the flashy and/or revealing clothes favored by many (though by no means all) of them. On top of that, they are more thinly spread; I daresay there are a few streetwalkers in many towns too small for a massage parlor or escort service. All the streetwalker needs to set up shop is a pair of shoes.\n\nIt's quite likely that just about everyone reading this has seen a few streetwalkers in his life (probably more than just a few), and since they do stand out they make a strong impression. It is the nature of the human mind to stereotype, which is of course how prejudices are formed. It is unfortunately not much of a leap for a person to go from \"I saw some prostitutes who looked like sleazy drug addicts\" to \"all prostitutes are sleazy drug addicts.\" Or to go from \"I read in the paper that many crimes are committed by black men\" to \"all black men are criminals.\" And so on. Even if the rational mind knows that not ALL members of a group are like its lowest elements, the temptation to classify any given member of that group as the lowest common denominator is very strong indeed. And when the people who are doing the stereotyping are in positions of authority, abominations like racial profiling are the inevitable result.\n\nAnother source of the stereotype is movies and television shows. The Hollywood prostitute is a curious creature; she looks like a call girl but dresses and acts like a streetwalker (except for her heart of gold). This applies only to main characters, of course; seedy-looking streetwalkers may be added to a street scene to give it a more run-down, low-class, skid row sort of atmosphere. Once in a great while there will be a high-class call girl (or a courtesan if the show is set far enough in the past), but this is a very rare exception. In the universe of movies and television, streetwalkers outnumber the rest of us by many hundreds to one. And considering how tenacious visual images can be, this false picture is permanently imbedded in the minds of many people.\n\nFinally, there's the vulgar appeal of the streetwalker. Many people are fascinated by vulgarity; our youth idolizes entertainers who adopt the personas of \"gangstas\", thugs, \"pimps\", skinheads and other lowlifes. The tabloids dwell on the lowest, sleaziest activities of celebrities, especially those celebrities who are merely famous specimens of what I grew up calling \"white trash.\" Television shows such as Jerry Springer, Cops and the numerous courtroom and \"reality\" shows present the worst, lowest, nastiest, sickest, most tawdry examples of human behavior as \"entertainment\". Vulgarity sells. And considering that, is it any surprise that most Americans would rather think about streetwalkers than call girls?\n\nSo"}

Making matters worse is the fact that the ruling party has trailed the center-left opposition Labor Party over the past several months in opinion polls.\n\nThe conservative Liberal Party-led coalition narrowly was re-elected at elections last July with a promise to let voters decide whether Australia should recognize same-sex marriage through a popular vote.\n\nLiberal Senator. Dean Smith, a gay man who opposed legalizing same-sex marriage when he was appointed to the Senate in 2012, has drafted a bill to allow gay marriage now and wants his fellow Liberal lawmakers to be allowed to vote on it according to their consciences rather than to according to party policy.\n\n\"It's time for the party to put the matter to rest once and for all,\" Smith told reporters on Monday.\n\nGay marriage opponents, including former Prime Minister Tony Abbott who initiated the plebiscite policy two year ago, argue that the government must stick to its election promise that marriage law would not be changed without a national vote.\n\n\"The last thing Australia needs is government by opinion poll,\" Abbott wrote in The Australian newspaper. \"But neither do we need political parties that believe one thing one minute and the opposite the next,\" said Abbott.\n\nTurnbull continues to support gay marriage and initially opposed the plebiscite concept.

They can play gotcha as much as they want, but all it proves is how badly we need better options. And we are still going to fight like heck to make sure options are available to everyone.\n\nAnd yet, for all that logic, I still find myself on edge. To be watched so much is a kind of never-ending nightmare. And sometimes it's just infuriating. I skipped the funeral this summer of Patrick Sorrento, an important mentor to me at my college newspaper, because I didn't want my minder to follow me and cause a distracting spectacle. When my daughter reports someone taking pictures of her at the airport, it drives me nuts. I have no idea if it's actually this outfit; common decency would suggest otherwise, but that seems an increasingly rare commodity.\n\nThere's plenty else that scares me this summer, of course: Every month we're breaking temperature records, and Donald J. Trump has introduced a new snarl to our public life. Against these fears, the best one can hope for is a kind of resiliency. For a planet in desperate trouble, it's good news that the price of a solar panel has plummeted. For our nation, there's the hope that the social fabric \u2014 the Little Leagues and Methodist churches and Black Lives Matter assemblies and League of Women Voters and library guilds and N.A.A.C.P. chapters \u2014 remain just strong enough that we'll escape the narcissistic nihilism of Mr. Trump.\n\nAs for me, there's comfort in the knowledge that the climate movement doesn't depend on me. For years now, I've been stepping back, mostly because I think the kind of movement we need is one that has thousands of leaders in thousands of places, connected like the solar panels on the roofs of an entire planet.\n\nIt's stronger that way, because different voices bring different arguments to the fore. But another good reason for that distributed model, one that I've thought of often this summer, is that even a successful attack on one person does little damage to the whole movement, in the same way that you can smash the solar panels on my roof and not black out the Eastern Seaboard.\n\nWhen that doesn't cheer me up sufficiently, I fall back on my colleagues all over the world. A good thing about movements is that you really do have brothers and sisters, and they do have your back. The fossil-fuel industry may threaten us as a planet, as a nation, and as individuals, but when we rise up together we've got a fighting chance against the powers that be.\n\nAnd perhaps that realization is just a little bit scary for them."}

{"id": 312, "ended": true, "length": 1008, "text": "Background\n\nSubstantial concerns have been raised about the neuropsychiatric safety of the smoking cessation medications varenicline and bupropion. Their efficacy relative to nicotine patch largely relies on indirect comparisons, and there is limited information on safety and efficacy in smokers with psychiatric disorders. We compared the relative neuropsychiatric safety risk and efficacy of varenicline and bupropion with nicotine patch and placebo in smokers with and without psychiatric disorders.\n\nMethods\n\nWe did a randomised, double-blind, triple-dummy, placebo-controlled and active-controlled (nicotine patch; 21 mg per day with taper) trial of varenicline (1 mg twice a day) and bupropion (150 mg twice a day) for 12 weeks with 12-week non-treatment follow-up done at 140 centres (clinical trial centres, academic centres, and outpatient clinics) in 16 countries between Nov 30, 2011, and Jan 13, 2015. Participants were motivated-to-quit smokers with and without psychiatric disorders who received brief cessation counselling at each visit. Randomisation was computer generated (1:1:1:1 ratio). Participants, investigators, and research personnel were masked to treatment assignments. The primary endpoint was the incidence of a composite measure of moderate and severe neuropsychiatric adverse events. The main efficacy endpoint was biochemically confirmed continuous abstinence for weeks 9\u201312. All participants randomly assigned were included in the efficacy analysis and those who received treatment were included in the safety analysis. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01456936 ) and is now closed.\n\nFindings\n\n8144 participants were randomly assigned, 4116 to the psychiatric cohort (4074 included in the safety analysis) and 4028 to the non-psychiatric cohort (3984 included in the safety analysis). In the non-psychiatric cohort, 13 (1\u00b73%) of 990 participants reported moderate and severe neuropsychiatric adverse events in the varenicline group, 22 (2\u00b72%) of 989 in the bupropion group, 25 (2\u00b75%) of 1006 in the nicotine patch group, and 24 (2\u00b74%) of 999 in the placebo group. The varenicline\u2013placebo and bupropion\u2013placebo risk differences (RDs) for moderate and severe neuropsychiatric adverse events were \u22121\u00b728 (95% CI \u22122\u00b740 to \u22120\u00b715) and \u22120\u00b708 (\u22121\u00b737 to 1\u00b721), respectively; the RDs for comparisons with nicotine patch were \u22121\u00b707 (\u22122\u00b721 to 0\u00b708) and 0\u00b713 (\u22121\u00b719 to 1\u00b745), respectively. In the psychiatric cohort, moderate and severe neuropsychiatric adverse events were reported in 67 (6\u00b75%) of 1026 participants in the varenicline group, 68 (6\u00b77%) of 1017 in the bupropion group, 53 (5\u00b72%) of 1016 in the nicotine patch group, and 50 (4\u00b79%) of 1015 in the placebo group. The varenicline\u2013placebo and bupropion\u2013placebo RDs were 1\u00b759 (95% CI \u22120\u00b742 to 3\u00b759) and 1\u00b778 (\u22120\u00b724 to 3\u00b781), respectively; the RDs versus nicotine patch were 1\u00b722 (\u22120\u00b781 to 3\u00b725) and 1\u00b742 (\u22120\u00b763 to 3\u00b746), respectively. Varenicline-treated participants achieved higher abstinence rates than those on placebo (odds ratio [OR] 3\u00b761, 95% CI 3\u00b707 to 4\u00b724), nicotine patch (1\u00b768, 1\u00b746 to 1\u00b793), and bupropion (1\u00b775, 1\u00b752 to 2\u00b701). Those on bupropion and nicotine patch achieved higher abstinence rates than those on placebo (OR 2\u00b707 [1\u00b775 to 2\u00b745] and 2\u00b715 [1\u00b782 to 2\u00b754], respectively). Across cohorts, the most frequent adverse events by treatment group were nausea (varenicline, 25% [511 of 2016 participants]), insomnia (bupropion, 12% [245 of 2006 participants]), abnormal dreams (nicotine patch, 12% [251 of 2022 participants]), and headache (placebo, 10% [199 of 2014 participants]). Efficacy treatment comparison did not differ by cohort.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe study did not show a significant increase in neuropsychiatric adverse events attributable to varenicline or bupropion relative to nicotine patch or placebo. Varenicline was more effective than placebo, nicotine patch, and bupropion in helping smokers achieve abstinence, whereas bupropion and nicotine patch were more effective than placebo.\n\nFunding\n\nPfizer and GlaxoSmithKline."}

{"id": 314, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Why do Santa's reindeer fly? The role of ancient mushroom-using shamans\n\nby Mark Adams\n\nThese red and white mushrooms, Amanita muscaria, were found in an alpine forest around Creede, Colorado. A. muscaria was the \"sacred mushroom\" used by the ancient tribal peoples of pre-Christian northern Europe. Its bright coloring suggests the colors of Santa's garments and of holiday lights.\n\nAlthough most people see Christmas as a Christian holiday, most of the symbols and icons we associate with Christmas celebrations are actually derived from the shamanistic traditions of the tribal peoples of pre-Christian northern Europe.\n\nThe sacred mushroom of these people was the red and white Amanita muscaria, also known as \"fly agaric.\" This mushroom commonly is seen in books of fairy tales and usually is associated with magic and fairies. It contains potent hallucinogenic compounds once used by ancient peoples for insight and transcendental experiences. Most of the major elements of the modern Christmas celebration, such as Santa Claus, Christmas trees, magical reindeer and the giving of gifts, are originally based upon the traditions surrounding the harvest and consumption of this most sacred mushroom.\n\nThe World Tree\n\n\nAncient peoples, including the Lapps of modern-day Finland, and the Koyak tribes of the central Russian steppes, believed in the idea of a World Tree. The World Tree was seen as a kind of cosmic axis onto which the planes of the universe are fixed. The roots of the World Tree stretch down into the underworld, its trunk is the \"middle earth\" of everyday existence, and its branches reach upwards into the heavenly realm.\n\nAmanita muscaria grows only under certain types of trees, mostly firs and evergreens. The cap of the mushroom is the fruit of the larger mycelium beneath the soil which exists in a symbiotic relationship with the roots of the tree. To ancient people, this mushroom was literally \"the fruit of the tree.\"\n\nThe North Star was also considered sacred, since all other stars in the sky revolved around its fixed point. They associated this \"Pole Star\" with the World Tree and the central axis of the universe. The top of the World Tree touched the North Star, and the spirit of the shaman would climb the metaphorical tree, thereby passing into the realm of the gods. This is the true meaning of the star on top of the modern Christmas tree, and also the reason that the super-shaman Santa makes his home at the North Pole.\n\nAncient peoples were amazed at how this magical mushroom sprang from the earth without any visible seed. They considered this \"virgin birth\" to have been the result of the morning dew, which was seen as the \"semen of the deity.\" The silver tinsel we drape onto our modern Christmas tree represents this divine fluid.\n\n\nOrigin of phrase, \"to get pissed\"\n\nThe active ingredients of A. muscaria are not metabolized by the body, and so they remain active in the urine. In fact, it is safer to drink the urine of one who has consumed the mushroom than to eat the mushroom directly, as many of the toxic compounds are processed and eliminated on the first pass through the body.\n\nIt was common practice among ancient people to recycle the potent effects of the mushroom by drinking each other's urine. The mushroom's ingredients can remain potent even after six passes through the human body. Some scholars argue that this is the origin of the phrase \"to get pissed,\" as this urine-drinking activity preceded alcohol by thousands of years.\n\nReindeer were the sacred animals of these semi-nomadic people, as the reindeer provided food, shelter, clothing and other necessities. Reindeer are also fond of eating the mushroom; they will seek it out, then prance about while under its influence. Often the urine of tripped-out reindeer would be consumed for its psychedelic effects.\n\nThis effect goes the other way too, as reindeer also enjoy the urine of a human, especially one who has consumed the mushroom. In fact, reindeer will seek out human urine to drink, and some tribesmen carry sealskin containers of their own collected piss, which they use to attract stray reindeer back into the herd.\n\nLegend of the flying reindeer and modern image of Santa\n\nThe effects of the A. muscaria usually include sensations of size distortion and flying. The feeling of flying could account for the legends of flying reindeer and legends of shamanic journeys included stories of winged reindeer, transporting their riders up to the highest branches of the World Tree.\n\nAlthough the modern image of Santa Claus was created at least in part by the advertising department of Coca-Cola, in truth his appearance, clothing, mannerisms and companions all mark him as the reincarnation of these ancient mushroom-gathering shamans.\n\nOne"}

Objective: We determined the relation between the ratio of n-6 to n-3 and cognitive function in children. We hypothesized that children with lower ratios of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids would perform better on tests of planning and working memory. Design: Seventy 7- to 9-y-old children completed three 24-h diet recalls and a subset of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Assessment Battery. Parents provided information on their demographics and children's diet histories. Results: Mean n-3 and mean n-6 intakes were related to the mean time spent on each action taken in the planning problem. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 significantly predicted performance on the working memory and planning problems. There was a significant interaction between the ratio and fatty acid intake; when children had high ratios, a higher intake of n-3 fatty acids predicted a better performance on the planning task than when children had lower n-3 intakes. When children had low ratios, a lower intake of n-3 and lower intake of n-6 predicted better performance than when intakes were higher. Conclusions: The relation between cognitive abilities and the ratio of n-6 to n-3 may be mediated by an enzymatic affinity for n-3 fatty acids. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 should be considered an important factor in the study of fatty acids and cognitive development. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01823419.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHigh omega-6 (n-6) to omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid ratios may be a preventable cause of cognitive and behavioral difficulties in children (1, 2). Fatty acids comprise all neuronal phospholipid membranes (3). Arachidonic acid (AA)4 (20:4n-6) and DHA (22:6n-3) make up 23% of the total lipids in the adult human cortex (4) where they play prominent roles in neurotransmitter metabolism (5, 6), synaptic growth (7), and neuronal communication (7, 8). In animals, AA and DHA are synthesized from their precursors linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and \u03b1-linolenic acid (18:3n-3), respectively (9\u201312). In humans, \u03b1-linolenic acid has been shown to convert to EPA, docosapentaenoic acid, and, although still debated, DHA in plasma (13\u201316; see reference 17 for a counterargument). The rate of conversion is not known in humans but may be quite low in part because of an imbalanced consumption of n-6 and n-3.\n\nThe ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids is important because the pathways share enzymes such that the ratio of fatty acids consumed may dictate the availability of desaturase and elongase further down the metabolic pathways (seeFigure 1 for an illustration of shared resources). This effect may be detrimental to cognition because the n-3 most prevalent in the brain (ie, DHA) is one of the final steps in the n-3 pathway. \u0394-6 Desaturase, which is thought to be the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway, is required twice in the metabolism of DHA (Figure 1) but could be depleted in the first desaturase step. Thus, endogenous DHA is likely low in individuals who eat high amounts of n-6 and low amounts of n-3 (ie, the typical American diet) (18).\n\nFIGURE 1.

View largeDownload slide n-6 and n-3 fatty acid metabolic pathways. FADS1, fatty acid desaturase 1; FADS2, fatty acid desaturase 2.\n\nBiochemical (19\u201321) and behavioral (1, 2, 22, 23) evidence has indicated that the balance of n-6 and n-3 may be important for cognition (24). Cognitive abilities known as executive functions develop when children are 3\u201310 y old (25\u201327) and are subserved by the temporal and frontal lobes (28\u201330). During this period of development, cortical gray matter increases rapidly in the frontal areas (31\u201333). The hippocampus (in the temporal lobes) and prefrontal cortex continue to develop beyond the first 2 y of life (31, 34\u201336) and have particularly high concentrations of AA and DHA (37, 38). AA (20) and DHA (39, 40) play important roles"}

Turner is obviously a legit prospect and he was (and is) hitting well in Triple-A. When Espinosa hit .185 in April and then .208 in May, leaving Turner down looked like a mistake. Maybe the Nationals were just saving on service time, or maybe they were worried Turner was averaging a strikeout a game. Or maybe Dusty Baker just likes veterans. Whatever the reason, they stuck with Espinosa, and he produced a monster June, including homers from both sides of the plate Thursday as part of a seven-RBI night as the Nats crushed the Reds. Espinosa hit .309/.418/.704 in June with nine home runs and 21 RBIs, making him a player of the month candidate. Meanwhile, Turner has played a couple games in center field down at Syracuse ... you know, just in case they want to call him up.\n\nGio on Danny Espinosa: \"In Danny we trust.

The Mets scored three runs in the seventh to take a 4-3 lead -- no idea why the Cubs thought signing Joel Peralta was a good idea -- but Jeurys Familia's streak of 42 consecutive regular-season saves was in jeopardy in the ninth inning after Miguel Montero walked and Ben Zobrist doubled pinch-runner Travis Wood to third base. Familia then struck out Kris Bryant and Willson Contreras (around an intentional walk to Anthony Rizzo) with a bunch of darting, diving, 97-mph sinkers that were moving down and in. Unhittable pitches, although some columnist out there will probably suggest that Bryant is overrated and can't hit good pitching.

A moderator received a four-month suspended sentence. Somewhat unusually, four regular users of the site were tracked down by their IP addresses. They too received custodial sentences.\n\nWhenever anti-piracy groups decide to take action against large file-sharing platforms, they do so on the basis of achieving crushing punishments for their operators. Only severe punishments can stop hardcore pirates, they argue.\n\nIn France, a similar situation has been playing out. Back in June 2015 following a four-month investigation, people connected to the public torrent site OMGTorrent were arrested and taken into custody. Early claims suggested the site had offered for download more than 10,000 pirated movies.\n\nFounded in 2008, the site had built up a solid userbase of around 3.5 million visitors per month. Police insisted it was a for-profit project.\n\n\"The people behind this platform do not do it for fun, through the platform they earn a lot of money,\" a police spokesperson said at the time. \"Even if they offer movies without requesting compensation, they earn money with various advertisements that appear alongside.\"\n\nSearches of two suspects' homes yielded several computers plus more than 3.5 terabytes of the latest movies. A separate server found overseas contained several thousand more.\n\nPolice warned that the site's operators could face 10 years in jail plus millions in damages, but they weren't going to stop there. Their investigations had led them to four of the site's top downloaders who they intended to prosecute for receiving stolen goods.\n\nAfter more than a year, six people connected with the site have now been sentenced and it's harsh punishments all round.\n\nFollowing a hearing in March, yesterday the Criminal Court of Chalons-en-Champagne (Marne, France) sentenced the founder of OMGTorrent to one year in prison. The 28-year-old was also ordered to pay a fine of around five million euros for the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted works.\n\nAlso sentenced was a 38-year-old woman who had worked as a moderator on the site. She was given a four-month suspended sentence and told to pay damages to the plaintiffs in the case.\n\nIn an unusual turn of events, prosecutors also tracked down four of the site's most heavy downloaders. They too were given prison sentences of one month each and are required to settle with rightsholders.\n\nBased on an investigation carried out by ALPA (Association Against Audiovisual Piracy), the prosecution estimated that damages exceed 20 million euros.\n\nFollowing the decision, the site's founder posted an update to the Wareziens forum.\n\n\"I've been fined a total of 5,000,000 euros for financial damage, 12 months imprisonment and 4 more [months] from a former sentence. My mod has to pay approximately 1,000,000 euros for financial damage,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Others, those who have downloaded, I don't know the amount for them, but it far exceeds 500,000 euros. Note: They seized the servers and used them to get the IP addresses of the big downloaders of content.\"\n\nLashing out at those who hounded him, the admin said the judgment had really hurt. He said he understands why he needed to be punished but for those lower down the chain, the sentences were \"beyond comprehension.\"\n\n\"To all the [anti-piracy groups and authorities]: You are a lot of vile shit, destroying lives of people who are already struggling to pay their rent, their food, their bills,\" he said.\n\n\"Why all this? Because they wanted to watch and because they didn't necessarily have the capabilities to buy a DVD / BluRay or go to the theaters.\"\n\nListing the country's most popular torrent indexes, trackers and DDL sites, the admin declared that they would never fall.\n\n\"Warez is a hydra, you cut off one head, 10 will grow back. You'll never kill this beautiful community. It's like drug dealers, it will never stop,\" he said.\n\nFollowing the raid on OMGTorrent, an unknown third-party managed to secure the domain. The site is now working, as it did before, as a public torrent index."}

The court has also set the date of 11 April to announce its verdict concerning other defendants in the case. The court has referred the death sentences to Egypt's Grand Mufti for revision. The referral of the sentences to the Mufti is the first step in the legal process required to enact a death sentence. The Mufti's decision is not binding. However, following his decision the court will issue a final verdict. Once a final verdict is issued, defendants can appeal. Badie and another 13 Brotherhood figures are convicted of setting up an operation after the violent dispersal of the Rabaa Al-Adaweya protest camp in mid-August in 2013 to direct the movements of Brotherhood supporters across the country as part of plans to defy the state and spread chaos, as well as plot attacks on police stations, private property and churches.\n\nSoltan was arrested in September 2013 as he tried to flee to Sudan, and was charged with incitement to kill and attempted murder.\n\nHis son Mohamed, who has become a cause celebre for the American media and U.S. Islamic organizations, was also convicted in the current case and will be sentenced on April 11:\n\nMohamed's father, Salah Soltan, has been sentenced to death..

I noted here that multiple Western media reports at the time identified Mohamed as one of the top leaders organizing the violent Muslim Brotherhood protests in Cairo following Morsi's removal from office.\n\nSalah Soltan has also been the subject of several of my reports here at PJ Media going back to January 2009 when he appeared on Al-Nas TV threatening America with death and destruction for its support of Israel.\n\nAt the same time the elder Soltan was threatening America on Middle East TV, his son Mohamed was seen leading anti-Jewish genocidal chants in front of the Ohio Statehouse (as I reported here last week):\n\nSalah Soltan was also a leading figure at the Muslim Brotherhood protests dispersed by Egyptian authorities in August 2013, even appearing on stage at the protest standing beside an al-Qaeda flag:\n\nOur late PJ Media colleague Barry Rubin noted here in August 2011 that Soltan had issued a fatwa in Egypt authorizing any Muslim to kill any Israeli that could be found in the country. He also took note of the media backlash I had received for reporting on Soltan's extremist activities and open support for Islamic terrorism.\n\nI followed up Barry's report with my own observing everything I had written about Salah Soltan going back to my first report in April 2006. Despite all the attempts by the establishment media to paint him as an interfaith moderate, I chronicled a lengthy list of his activities:\n\nA year later, Salah Soltan was a senior member of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt.

It is used for spellcasting, for invoking divine powers (with the exception of Trog) and for evoking abilities granted by worn items, mutations, and intrinsic abilities.\n\nHaving your MP fall to zero is not directly lethal, but can be very hazardous for a spellcaster. MP will regenerate up to your maximum with time, and it is often recommended that spellcasters should rest up to full MP after every fight.\n\nSome items like rings of magical power or staves of power can increase a given character's reserves of magical power.\n\nYour maximum MP without benefit of items is a function of your experience level, your race, and whichever of your Spellcasting, Evocations, and Invocations skill is higher. Training Spellcasting provides twice as much MP as Invocations or Evocations. Depending on your character, though, this may not be a concern.\n\nA typical character starts with 0-7 MP (e.g. 0 for a Minotaur Fighter, 6 for Deep Elf Conjurer, 7 for Deep Elf Wizard) and eventually grows to many times that (30-40 for a level 20 Mummy Necromancer, or 50-60 when using extra items).\n\nStrategy\n\nMP is a very important stat for spellcasters. Early or mid game rings of magical power are extremely useful, since MP costs are low and your base mana pool is small. However, as your MP hits around the 40+ mark, the efficiency of this stat gets drastically lower. Perhaps the only source of MP that you should use at this point is a staff of magical power, but even that could be replaced by an enhancer staff if you find one appropriate for you.\n\nMethods of MP restoration:\n\nFormula\n\nMP modifiers\n\nFrom Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup in-game documentation:\n\nBa Ce DD DE Dg Ds Dr Fe Fo Gr Gh Gn Ha HO Hu Ko Mf Mi Mu Na Op Og Sp Te Tr Vp VS 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 1 1 -1 0 1\n\nDemigods additionally start with the High MP mutation.\n\nHistory\n\n0.17 simplified MP calculations.

Species aptitudes used to be multiplicative, but are now additive.\n\nBefore 0.14, the formula was:\n\nUnscaled MP = XL + Permanent MP + (XL*Species modifier + 1)/3 + max(Spellcasting*XL/4, Invocations*XL/6, Evocations*XL/6)\n\nwhere Permanent MP was a constant determined by the player's background and species."}

I've always read a lot, and I've always read a lot of different books. There are a couple of genres that I've never really been a fan of, but I've always been a non-discriminating reader. However. Historical fiction has always been an absolute favorite of mine. 9 times out of 10 as a kid, my nose was found in an American Girl book or a Dear America book. I hungrily read anything that could transport me to a time and place and situation other than my own.\n\n\nBoston Jane was a solid historical fiction read. It was well-done, and obviously well-researched, which is something that is always appreciated, of course. I was transported to early 19th century America as I was reading. Jane is a wonderful character, and a truly enjoyable narrator. She is spunky, spirited, and full of determination, whether it's determination to become a lady, or determination to make the best of her circumstances. She was frustratingly true to her time--from referring to the Indians that she meets as \"savages\" (at first) to adamantly sticking to Miss Hepplewhite's \"rules of being a lady\" even when it didn't make sense to act as a lady anymore. She is not a flawless character, but I always like that. I don't always want to read about someone who I like from the get-go. Sometimes, I like to watch a character come into their own as I read, and Jane really does that in this book.\n\n\nJennifer L. Holm also wrote a good cast of supporting characters that I know I will look back and fondly remember (even the not-so-nice ones), including Papa, Sally Biddle, Jehu, Mr. Swan, Mr. Russell, Suis, and Handsome Jim. They were all pretty well fleshed out, and even those who didn't necessarily show character development were characters whom I felt like I knew.\n\n\nAbove all, though, this is an adventure story. Jane's adventure story. She sailed to the opposite coast of the United States to start a new life, but even besides that, there was always something going on. I think this is part of what made it such a solid historical fiction read. With every new happening, the reader gets another glimpse of what life would have entailed in the pioneer west of that time.\n\n\nThis was not the best book I've ever read, by any means, but it was a solid good read that kept me up late reading on a couple of occasions. The only thing I am unsure of is how to classify this story. If I had to take a stab, I'd say this is an older MG/younger YA read. There is a 16-year-old narrator and some events that might be considered a bit mature for some audiences, but the writing itself felt like it was geared towards younger readers. I'd recommend this one to maybe older junior high readers looking for a good historical fiction adventure.\n\n\nOn a side note, I did just find out that there are sequels to this. I'm not sure if I will continue with the series, though. I liked Boston Jane so much, so I'm not sure I want to mar my feelings toward it. In other words, I think this installment can definitely stand on its own. I am curious though..."}

(NOWCastSA)\n\nA few weeks ago, the World Bank updated its analysis of Global Extreme Poverty, dozens of chapters dedicated to exploring, in minute detail, the many complex and intersecting reasons as to why people are poor.\n\nAbout the same time, San Antonio Mayor Ivy Taylor was asked a similar question about the root causes of poverty in her city. She offered a simple rationale:\n\nBroken people.\n\nParticularly broken people who don't have a strong relationship with God.\n\nThe statement has incensed newly minted critics of Taylor days before the city's mayoral election. They claim it was an insensitive one-two punch of blaming poverty on the poor and asserting that nonreligious people are at the root of society's ills.\n\nOn April 3, Taylor (D) and fellow candidate, San Antonio councilman Ron Nirenberg, were at a mayoral forum and took a question from the director of San Antonio's Christian Resource Center, according to the San Antonio Current: \"What do you see as the deepest, systemic causes of generational poverty in San Antonio?\"\n\nIn the video, Taylor makes a joke about the hefty nature of the question, asks the questioner to repeat it, then says, \"I'll go ahead and put it out there\":\n\nTo me, it's broken people. People not being in relationships with their creator and therefore not being in good relationship with their families and their communities and not being productive members of society. So I mean, I think that's the ultimate answer.\n\nAnnie Laurie Gaylor, one of the co-presidents of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, said her organization was prompted to send a letter to Taylor defending people who are not religious.\n\n\"As mayor, you represent a diverse population that consists of not only Christians, but also atheists, agnostics, Jews, Muslims, and Hindus,\" the letter said. \" \u2026 Nationally, about 35 percent of millennials are nonreligious. Imagine for a moment a mayoral candidate making such undeserved and broad accusations against Jews or Muslims instead of nonbelievers. The outcry would properly be swift and severe. It should be no different for nonbelievers.\"\n\nMayor Ivy Taylor (Photo courtesy of Ivy Taylor)\n\nGaylor told The Washington Post she feared the mayor's words would send a message to other political leaders that it's okay for religiosity to guide politics.\n\n\"As mayor, she has a bully pulpit, but it shouldn't be an actual pulpit,\" Gaylor said. \"It implies the root of all bad things is Godlessness. \u2026 San Antonio is not a congregation. She's not a pastor. She's a mayor. We do hope that she'll realize not just what's offensive about it, but that it is so wrong.\"\n\nTaylor posted a lengthy statement on her Facebook page, claiming the video clip that surfaced had been selectively edited to misrepresent her views. In particular, she said she doesn't believe that just poor people are \"broken.\"\n\n[This mayor won't stop posting racist Obama memes. He won't resign, either.]\n\n\"I also believe in Original Sin, and that was the context for my comment in the YouTube video clip. We're all 'broken,' from the richest among us to the poorest, until we forge a relationship with our Maker. I could have expressed myself more clearly in explaining my belief at the forum.\"\n\nIn an interview, Taylor told The Post she believes society would be better if people had a stronger relationship with God. But she said she has tried to stress to voters that San Antonio is not a theocracy, and she doesn't believe leaders should govern from the Bible.\n\n\"I don't know if anyone took the time to really understand what I was trying to convey. And if I wasn't effective in communicating that, then I certainly wish I could have been clearer,\" she said.\n\n\"The history of our urban areas is that a lot of the policies that have been developed on the federal and local levels have led to the creation of islands of poverty,\" she said. \"I've spent my career on efforts trying to level the playing field.\"\n\nBut as the mayor has tried to explain her thinking, Gaylor said her group felt that she was just affirming the statement about religion and government that they had the biggest problem with.\n\n\"There had been a Facebook statement, and it's kind of a non-apology apology,\" Gaylor said. \"This just isn't good enough.\"\n\n\"It's a stereotype that she's perpetuating,\" Gaylor continued. \"We're not criticizing her record combating poverty \u2026 we're blaming her for blaming nontheism or non-Godliness for poverty.\"\n\nOn the phone with Trey Ware of KTSA 550am.

{"id": 338, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "The proposed Europa Clipper mission would go into orbit around Jupiter, instead of Europa itself, making several dozen close flybys of the icy moon. At an estimated cost of $2.1 billion, it is less than half the cost of previous Europa orbiter concepts, but NASA is looking for ways to further reduce costs. (credit: NASA/JPL) Europa on the cheap\n\nFor decades, scientists have dreamed of sending a mission to Europa, one of Jupiter's four large Galilean moons. The fleeting flybys of the moon by Voyagers 1 and 2 in 1979, and the more frequent flybys by Galileo in the 1990s, revealed a world with a icy crust, crisscrossed by fractures and other complex features. Those and other observations led scientists to conclude that Europa has, below that icy crust, a subterranean ocean of liquid water that, combined with the energy from tidal heating that keeps that ocean liquid and organic compounds, provide the basic requirements for life. Instead of going into orbit around Europa, the Europa Clipper spacecraft would instead go into orbit around Jupiter and make repeated close flybys of the moon. As compelling as the scientific case is for Europa, NASA has yet to send a dedicated mission there. Part of that is due to the technical challenges involved in launching a spacecraft to Jupiter and operating in the high radiation environment created by Jupiter's powerful magnetic field. Those technical obstacles drive up the costs of those proposed missions, and reduce the chances they can be funded. NASA has studied Europa orbiter mission proposals since the late 1990s, but those efforts typically foundered on costs and shifting priorities. In 2011, the latest planetary science decadal survey\u2014the once-per-decade report outlining priorities for planetary science missions based on science and other factors\u2014identified a Europa orbiter as the second-highest priority large, or \"flagship\" mission, behind a rover to collects samples on Mars for later return to Earth. That ranking, though, came with a caveat: an independent study of the mission concluded it would cost $4.7 billion, too high a price tag. For a Europa mission to remain highly ranked, NASA needed to bring down the cost significantly. (See \"Tough decisions ahead for planetary exploration\", The Space Review, April 4, 2011). NASA has been working on reducing a cost of a Europa orbiter mission, in large part by no longer making it an orbiter. The concept now favored within the space agency is something called \"Europa Clipper.\" Instead of going into orbit around Europa, the spacecraft would instead go into orbit around Jupiter and make repeated close flybys of the moon. The most recent mission designs involve 45 flybys of Europa over three and a half years, with the vast majority of them coming within 100 kilometers of the moon's surface. That approach minimizes the spacecraft's exposure to radiation as well as propellant needed for entering orbit around Europa. Europa Clipper is still in its earliest phases, with a mission concept review planned for September. A notional design for the mission, presented at a meeting of NASA's Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) in January, showed a spacecraft equipped with nine instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and an ice-penetrating radar, whose booms extended from either side of the spacecraft's bus like parts of an old-fashioned television antenna. Launched on an Atlas V 551 in November 2021, the spacecraft would arrive at Jupiter in April 2028 after gravity assist flybys of Venus and the Earth. That design has a cost estimate of about $2.1 billion, less than half the independent cost estimate for the earlier Europa orbiter mission in the decadal survey report. That work on Europa Clipper has largely been done at the insistence of Congress, rather than by NASA's own initiative. In the final fiscal year 2013 budget, Congress set aside $75 million of NASA's planetary sciences budget specifically for Europa mission studies, and followed that up with $80 million in the fiscal year 2014 budget, even though NASA requested no money in either year's budget request for Europa. The text of the final 2014 appropriations bill noted that the $80 million \"shall be for pre-formulation and/or formulation activities for a mission that meets the science goals outlined for the Jupiter Europa mission in the most recent planetary science decadal survey.\" When NASA released its fiscal year 2015 budget proposal last month, it contained, for the first time, a line item for Europa mission studies. NASA requested $15 million for fiscal year 2015, but was short on details in the document on how the money would be used. \"Following the analysis of options for a lower-cost Europa mission conducted in FY 2014, NASA will continue developing the architecture for a potential Europa mission,\" the budget justification document stated. \"My desire, to be quite honest, would be to target a Europa mission that we could fly for a billion dollars or less,\" Bolden said.

They said, \"You'll get calluses on your knuckles and nobody will want to marry you.'\"\n\nShe paused, then added: \"People really did talk like that back then.\"\n\nDenise is a small woman in her sixties. She wears big glasses and smiles a lot and practices massage therapy. She's also a karate black belt, and has been head sensei of the Women's Center Karate Club since the eighties, but no more: this fall, shortly after the death of its founder Susan Ribner \u2014 who also helped found the National Women's Martial Arts Federation \u2014 Denise closed New York City's last women-only karate school.\n\nWomen-only karate classes seem, in retrospect, like the perfect apotheosis of 1970s New York. It was one of the city's most violent eras, with approximately 2,000 murders and 5,000 reported rapes per year, not to mention an average of 250 subway felonies each week \u2014 the 4 train was known as the Mugger's Express. It was also the heyday of second-wave feminism: Gloria Steinem founded Ms. Magazine, the Black Women's Manifesto was published, the ERA went to Congress and Take Back the Night events began. Feminists everywhere wanted change, and while sometimes the issues one group represented clashed with those of another, one thing women seemed to agree on was the nobody felt all that safe.\n\nFrom this fertile ground three women-only karate schools sprang up, simultaneously and independently, within a couple miles of each other. Brooklyn Women's Martial Arts held classes in apartments and at street fairs. The Karate School for Women had a storefront in the West Village. The Women's Center Karate Club operated from the locker-lined bunkroom of a decommissioned firehouse in the West 20s, which they eventually lost due to rising rents \u2014 for most of its existence the club operated out of rooms rented by the hour.\n\nThough this was the era of consciousness-raising \u2014 women gathering to share stories for solidarity \u2014 karate was separate from that. Instead they learned chops and kicks and blocks and a confident way of being in the world, best summarized to me by Denise's description of kiai: staring stare someone down while shouting. \"I used to be so shy,\" she says. \"But now, if I look you in the eyes I can just about cut you.\"\n\nClass material was the same as in male-dominated karate dojos \u2014 the difference wasn't the what but the how. In your typical karate class you begin by tearing the ego down, but in women-only classes you build the ego up \u2014 not in a \"you look great\" or \"reach for the stars\" kind of way, but something more like \"yes, your instincts are absolutely right, that guy is bad news.\" Many of the women, Denise suggested, had been through some sort of trauma, and women's karate was about trusting your gut and taking action, a pretty novel lesson in an era when marital rape was legal and women were subject to their husbands' whims via \"head and master\" laws. From subway platforms to family rooms, trusting your gut is good advice that's hard to take when you've been raised with June Cleaver as ideal woman.\n\nThough they'd all bloomed so suddenly together, the city's women-only karate schools faded away slowly and separately. The Karate School for Women was the first to go: owner Roberta Schine, among whose students was Weather Underground leader Kathy Boudin, closed up shop in 1995 to become a yoga teacher. Also in the nineties, Brooklyn Women's Martial Arts morphed into something else entirely: The Center for Anti-violence Education. Almost twenty years later, in October 2014, the Women's Center Karate Club finally closed its doors.\n\nWhy did women-only karate fade away?\n\nMaybe women just felt safer, and certainly they had less time, as they were increasingly able to land a variety of jobs but still shouldered most of the household chores. I suspect the waning popularity of karate itself also has had something to do with it. American karate peaked in the eighties, but the glory days of Miyagi coaching Daniel-san in Karate Kid are long over, and strip mall karate now seems shabby next to newer imports: krav maga, muay thai and Brazilian juijitsu, plus the flashy, fast-paced combo of them all \u2014 mixed martial arts.\n\nWomen still practice karate, and they're allowed in dojos now, but most dojos remain 90% male.

He captained the Islanders' early '80s dynasty that captured four straight championships and won 19 consecutive postseason series, a record that likely stands as completely unbreakable in the salary-cap era. He averaged just less than a point per game over his career, and retired as the league's all-time leading scorer among defensemen.\n\nAs for you still-chanting Rangers fans, here's a fun fact: Potvin claimed that Mike Keenan asked him to make a comeback and join the 1993-94 Rangers team that eventually won the Stanley Cup. Potvin, who by then was 41 years old and had been out of hockey for six years, considered the offer but eventually declined.\n\n9.

He led the league in points four times in a five-year stretch, won two MVPs, and helped the Blackhawks win a Stanley Cup in 1961 that would be the franchise's last for 49 years.\n\nBut beyond the stats, Mikita had a fascinating career. He was one of the first European-born players to star in the NHL. He was among the first of what we now consider the prototypical two-way center, dominating at both ends of the ice and becoming an excellent faceoff man. He and Hull helped pioneered the use of curved blades. Over the years he transformed from one of the league's most penalized players to an eventual Lady Byng winner. And he even designed and marketed his own style of helmet. A horrible, ugly helmet.\n\n8. Mike Bossy, New York Islanders (1977-1987)\n\nQuick: Who's the NHL's all-time leader in goals per game? OK, it's obviously Mike Bossy since the question is appearing in his section. But if it weren't for that giveaway, wouldn't you have guessed someone like Mario Lemieux or Pavel Bure or Brett Hull first? It shouldn't be possible to own the record for most consecutive 50-goal seasons and still be criminally underrated, but Bossy comes close to pulling it off.\n\nThis is because of injury problems that cut his career short. Bossy had only turned 30 during the 1986-87 season, but his back was already a mess. He took the next season off in hopes of mounting a comeback, but it wasn't to be, and he retired after playing just 10 seasons.\n\nEven by the insane standards of the 1980s, Bossy's numbers were eye-popping. Nine consecutive 50-goal seasons. Five 60-goal years. A 50-in-50 season in 1981. A career shooting percentage of 21.2 percent.\n\nIn what's becoming a bit of a running theme among players on this list, Bossy almost didn't qualify. While pondering a comeback, he was rumored to be offered to his hometown Canadiens (who had famously passed on him in the 1977 draft, taking Mark Napier instead). But the deal never happened, and Bossy officially retired in the summer of 1988.\n\n7. Joe Sakic, Quebec Nordiques/Colorado Avalanche (1988-2009)\n\nSakic counts, right? We said we were ranking guys who played for one franchise, so we can't use the fact that the Nordiques became the Avalanche against him. He"}

It's usually easy to treat.\n\nCauses of scurvy Scurvy is caused by not having enough vitamin C in your diet for at least 3 months. Vitamin C is mainly found in fruit and vegetables. Even people who don't eat very healthily all the time aren't usually considered at risk of scurvy.\n\nThings that increase your risk of scurvy Although scurvy is rare, you may be more at risk if you: are on an unusual or restrictive \"fad\" diet \u2013 with very few or no sources of vitamin C\n\n\u2013 with very few or no sources of vitamin C eat very little food at all \u2013 possible reasons include treatments that make you feel very sick all the time (such as chemotherapy) or an eating disorder such as anorexia\n\n\u2013 possible reasons include treatments that make you feel very sick all the time (such as chemotherapy) or an eating disorder such as anorexia have a poor diet and smoke \u2013 smoking reduces how much vitamin C your body absorbs from food\n\n\u2013 smoking reduces how much vitamin C your body absorbs from food have a poor diet and are pregnant or breastfeeding \u2013 your body needs more vitamin C at these times Important Speak to your GP or midwife before taking any supplements or making changes to your diet during pregnancy. Other groups who may be more at risk of scurvy include: people with a severe digestive condition, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis\n\nbabies and young children who aren't getting the recommended amount of vitamins \u2013 read about vitamins for children\n\nvery elderly people, who may find it harder to cook or maintain a healthy diet\n\npeople addicted to drugs or alcohol\n\nSee a GP if you're at risk of scurvy and you: feel very tired and weak all the time\n\nfeel irritable and sad all the time\n\nhave severe joint or leg pain\n\nhave swollen, bleeding gums \u2013 sometimes teeth can fall out\n\ndevelop red or blue spots on the skin, usually on your shins\n\nhave skin that bruises easily These might be symptoms of scurvy.\n\nTreating scurvy Scurvy is easily treated by adding some vitamin C to your diet, such as fresh fruit and vegetables. Your GP may also recommend taking vitamin C supplements until you feel better. They might arrange a blood test to confirm you have scurvy if they're not sure. Most people treated for scurvy feel better within 48 hours and make a full recovery within 2 weeks. Your GP may refer you to a specialist for treatment, support or advice. This depends on what's causing your scurvy."}
{"id": 345, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "ONE difficulty of reporting on spy outfits like America's National Security Agency is the veil of secrecy they operate behind. This makes it hard to know exactly what they are and aren't capable of. It is also one reason why Edward Snowden's revelations have been so fascinating. They offer a glimpse\u2014limited and incomplete, to be sure\u2014behind the curtain, and help to constrain the bounds of just what such agencies can do.\n\nTake a recent post on Wired's security blog. It discusses the latest Snowden leak, which details the size of America's secret-intelligence budget. In particular, Wired picks up on James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, talking about investing in \"groundbreaking cryptanalytic capabilities to defeat adversarial cryptography and exploit internet traffic\". And it links to another post in which James Bamford, a veteran chronicler of the NSA, describes the agency as having made \"an enormous breakthrough several years ago in its ability to cryptanalyze, or break, unfathomably complex encryption systems employed by not only governments around the world but also many average computer users\". That sounds a lot like saying that the the spooks have managed to break at least some of the cryptographic codes that protect everything from secure e-mail to e-commerce.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\nIf true, it would be a very big story indeed. Such codes are ubiquitous because they are widely thought to be secure. If such a breakthrough has indeed happened (and Mr Snowden, for one, has said that it hasn't) what would it look like? Not being privy to the NSA's deepest secrets, Babbage has no idea. But he can speculate.\n\nThe most likely (and least interesting) answer is that the NSA has found a bug in the way that specific programs implement cryptographic protocols. Such flaws are fairly common, and can usually be fixed simply by patching the software. (Though that relies on people finding the flaws and then sharing that information widely, which NSA would be unlikely to do.) However, Mr Clapper's and Mr Bamford's use of \"groundbreaking\" and \"breakthrough\" to describe the NSA's advances could be read as suggesting that something more fundamental could be at hand\u2014perhaps even a flaw in the mathematics that underpin cryptography.\n\nElectronic cryptography relies on the curious fact that some mathematical operations are easy to do in one direction but virtually impossible to perform in reverse. For example, multiplying two enormous prime numbers together to get a third colossal number is easy. But, analysing a colossal number produced in this way and trying to determine its prime factors is colossally difficult. So difficult, in fact, that it stumps even the world's snappiest supercomputers. This bit of mathematics\u2014integer factorisation in the argot\u2014forms the foundation of most of the internet's cryptographic systems (codes based on other kinds of mathematical operation exist, but they aren't as commonly used).\n\nResearchers already know that it is possible, in theory, to break such encryption by building a quantum computer, an unusual machine that relies on various kinds of quantum weirdness to perform its calculations. A mathematician called Peter Shor proved in 1993 that such a computer could be used to speed up integer factorisation drastically, to the point where much of the internet's existing security infrastructure would be useless.\n\nDoes the NSA have a quantum computer in the basement of its headquarters in Maryland (pictured above)? It is theoretically possible, but pretty unlikely. For building a working quantum computer is itself terribly tricky. University laboratories have been trying for years, but the technology is finicky and progress has been slow. The record for prime factorisation using Shor's algorithm currently stands at the number \"21\", which was split into its prime factors (7 and 3) in 2012. A Canadian firm called D-Wave is presently selling a specialised kind of quantum computer\u2014Lockheed Martin, an American defence giant, and Google have each bought one\u2014but it is not suitable for this kind of work. And contrary to spy thrillers and conspiracy theories, it is far from obvious that a government agency could be so much more advanced than the academic cutting-edge, especially in a hardware and technology-heavy field like quantum computing.\n\nThere is another option, though. Mathematicians are much easier to get hold of than quantum computers, and do not require any fancy technology to work (a computer, a stack of paper and a bin will suffice). Signals-intelligence agencies employ them by the hundreds. And although it is difficult at present to find the prime factors of big numbers, no one has actually formally proved that it has to be so. In other words, no one knows whether the present state of the art is the fastest way to do things. Quicker ways may well exist.\n\nIndeed, earlier in the year, there was some excitement in cryptographic circles when a pair of new papers reported the first significant progress in years in something called the \"discrete log"}
{"id": 346, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Alright Personal answer as many do not seem to know too much about Syria, myself included, this may be a bit long\n\nFor reference in this answer: The current Syrian Constitution\n\nTo start we need some history\n\nSyria was under French mandate from 1922-1944 effectively giving them control over Syria. After the French had withdrawn, Syria has been in a constant state of civil war with one coup after another with factions constantly fighting, some even sponsored by the US. The regimes went through many different periods of dictatorship and democracy's constantly being replaced.\n\nIt was not until 1963 when The Arab Socialist Resurrection (Baath) Party (hereafter, Baath Party), with a secular, socialist, Arab nationalist orientation, took decisive control in a March 1963 coup. The Baath Party was active in throughout the middle East since the 1940's.\n\nIn 1970 a revolt occurred after many military failures a bloodless coup occurred and Hafez al-Assad, former Defense Lieutenant General, won the popular referendum and became president for the next 30 years.\n\nIn 1973 a constitution was established defining the roles of parliament, the president and vice president, the cabinet of ministers, and the people. It began by declaring Syria under a single party system that party being the Baath party, Islamic Jurisprudence was also established based on Shia law, the president is also required to be a follower of Islam. However, it also allowed for freedom of religion so long as public order is not threatened, this would later be used primarily on Sunni Arabs and Jews in Syria. There was a large focus on education and jobs as a right of the people for the government to uphold.\n\nDuring the next 30 years Hafez's regime would be labeled authoritarian as a State of Emergency was declared allowing for suppression of citizens. Notably the Muslim Brotherhood who rose up declaring the regime too secular, I honestly didn't think I'd be typing that. Many reports of people disappearing or being assassinated. The economy also did poorly during much of this time according to the source in the header.\n\nIn 2000 Hafez died. Parliament amended the constitution lowering the age for the presidency from 40 to 34 allowing Bashar Assad, Hafezs son, to run. Parliament did not elect any opposition to run against Assad.\n\nAssad was met with pushback. A few years later Assad began reforming by enforcing/enacting mandatory retirement and replacing certain high-level administrators with appointments from outside the Baath Party. This effectively kicked many of the old out of the government who opposed his rule.\n\nIn 2011 many rebellion groups began to pop up and a few years later a civil war broke out.\n\nIn 2012 the Syrian Constitution was amended again transforming Syria into a multi-party democracy like much of the West.\n\nIs Syria a Dictatorship - Section based off of The current Syrian Constitution\n\nIt can be for 3 months. Syria follows a parliamentary system. In this system The Citizens of Syria elect members of parliament who then proceed to nominate one or more candidates for the presidency. The president then appoints a cabinet who have to be confirmed by parliament, the same way in the US.\n\nThe president more or less has power over most things aside from the law, which he is tasked to enforce. When parliament is out of session the president gains power over the law, however when parliament is back in session their first order of business is to scrutinize any laws made with the ability to throw them out in their entirety.\n\nThe president can also abolish parliament for up to 3 months, however a reason is needed and parliament can never be abolished twice for the same reason.\n\nThe president also has veto power, when parliament passes a bill the president can veto it, in which case it goes back to parliament where if it passes again with a super majority it will become law.\n\nSo in short, kind of. The president can gain absolute power at times and the system is flimsy without much oversight that I could find of the president itself. I'll put it this way if the US is a Demo-Republic then Syria is an Oligarch-Democracy.\n\nAlso worth noting in the 2012 referendum the presidency was limited to two 7 year terms. Meaning that if they wish to prove any semblance of non-dictatorial rule that this should legally be Assads last term ending in 2021. One more thing, a state of emergency had been in place for over 30 years allowing governments to seize those that speak out openly against the government. Assad lifted this state of emergency in hopes of avoiding a civil war.\n\nPersonal Thoughts\n\nThe Syrian regime, under the founding Baath party, seemed to show a great deal of French influence with their political breakdown/separation of power, religious liberty, and the government giving to the people. These were not commonly found during that period with many still being under Shariah or totalitarian regimes.\n\nNot to say this is not a totalitarian regime. Syria had been in a State of Emergency for over 30 years now"}

In the past I have discussed the usually theories around HAARP etc, and even touched on chemtrails, yet with so much talk on global climate change and carbon emissions, with little or no mention of geo-engineering of climate, I again wonder... In the intervening years I have taken a consideration that the sun - our Solar Ra - has much to do with earth changes in our solar vicinity as well as on Earth, and have been looking into solar flares. No doubt more on this later. First, just a teaser - I came across this intriguing reference to the St. Louis Arch, a 636 ft. monument on the west bank of the Mississippi River, which has stood for nearly forty years. This short article titled ' Can We Control the Weather? ' says that\nIt is a shining monument built to convey St. Louis's role as the Gateway to the West. Only now has the reason for its construction as well as its true purpose been revealed. It seems that some of the same scientists responsible for the doomsday weapon research in the deserts of the Southwest U.S. during the forties, were also interested in controlling the weather. They hoped to use weather control as a means to aid in troop movement and logistics for the Allies, as well as use it as a tactical weapon against the enemy. This, they hoped, would bring about a quick end to the war in Europe.\nThus, the design for the arch was conceived. The stainless steel structure, while able to produce an ionic pulse, is impervious to any lingering affects. Each leg of the arch is able to push positive and negative ions into the air so as to create a positive or negatively charged field that can 'push' storms out of the way. During the day this national monument stands as the gateway to the west, but after hours this man-made marvel turns into one of the most powerful weather controlling devices ever conceived.\nIt makes us wonder about some of the other modern architectural feats being erected around the world... -"}

With a forceful clench of his fist, the incandescent flames wrapped around his fists once more.\n\n*Bam*\n\nBefore No.3 could even react, the flaming fist slammed into his chest and sent his entire body careening through the air.\n\nNext to him, Big 4 was able to recover his stance with the time bought by No.3. As No.3 was sent flying, he counter attacked with his spiked mace.\n\nHowever, this attack was immediately stopped by the steel-like palms of the Demon Child, who with a clench of his fist, immediately took control of the incoming mace. With a violent tug, the mace left the hands of Big 4 and was immediately tossed away by Chipped Horn. With a fiery punch to his body, Big 4 was sent flying as well, his injuries just as severe as No.3. The pair would probably be unable to get up for a while.\n\nIn the short span of time it took for him to defeat No.3 and Big 4, I wasn't idling about either. As the familiar flames extended from my hands, I prepared my sneak attack.\n\nFlame Whip!\n\nThe snake-like whip coiled around the left leg of Chipped Horn without much trouble.

It was still effective against large imps, but against head imps, its effects were significantly weaker. The enemy in front was even stronger than a head imp, so casting them was merely a waste of mana.\n\nMy nether flames were still sealed up, so I couldn't use them. As for the bone wall...he was already able to break through them when he was a head imp. That means only my flame whip had any chance of working. No matter how slim those chances were, I still wanted to take the gamble.\n\nUnfortunately, that gamble failed miserably. As expected, he was immune to my flames.\n\n\"Err...let's sit down and talk, there's no need for all this violence.\"\n\n\"I want you!\"\n\nChipped Horn wasn't in the mood to waste anymore time. He glared at me for a moment before instantly pouncing towards me.\n\nDamn it, don't just jump straight into action after saying so!\n\nBone Wall!\n\nIn this crucial moment, I ended up relying on my bone wall after all. Even though I knew it was useless, I still struggled.\n\nThe creamy white wall immediately rose up from the ground, blocking the path between me and Chipped Horn. He wasn't able to react to the sudden obstacle in front of him and rammed headlong into it.\n\n*crash*\n\nThe tank-like demon child rammed right through the bones as if they were merely paper. With that, the bone wall crumbled into a pile of broken shards. This was soon followed by the sound of a second bone wall being destroyed, and then a third...However, at this moment my eyes flickered to his feet, and a bone wall instantly rose at the point where his foot was about to land.\n\nMy plan was to trip him with my bone wall as he landed. The unexpected landfall would cause him to lose his balance and fall. Unfortunately for me, having evolved into a demon child, Chipped Horn seemed to have gained inhuman reflexes as well.\n\nThe moment he noticed the bone wall, he shifted his weight towards the front, regaining his balance. With a light kick of his feet, he made a tiny leap off the rising wall, as if it were stepping stone.\n\nWhile he wasted time on this tiny wall, I prepared a 4th bone wall in his path. If everything went according to plan, he wouldn't be able to change his course midair and would crash right into that wall.\n\nHowever, tactics were meaningless in front of such immense strength. Even with my mana strengthening this wall, the outcome was still as bleak as the other three.\n\nWhile he wasn't able to change course as expected, he instead clasped his hands together and raised them up high.

{"id": 356, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "by Paul Kay and Luisa Maffi cite\n\n1. The World Color Survey\n\nThe following four maps (132A, 133A, 134A, 135A) show the distribution of colour terms in some of the world's languages, based on the World Color Survey. This project, a collaboration of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), collected colour-naming data from 110 languages being studied by SIL linguist-translators in the late 1970s. For further details on methods and results of the World Color Survey see Kay et al. (1991), Kay and Berlin (1997), Kay et al. (1997), Hardin and Maffi (1997), Kay and Maffi (1999).\n\n2. Basic colour term concepts\n\nIn recent models of the universals and evolution theory of basic colour terms, stemming originally from Berlin and Kay (1969), three kinds of universal colour categories are recognized (Kay and McDaniel 1978, Kay et al. 1991, Kay et al. 1997, Kay and Maffi 1999): primary colour categories, composite (disjunctive) colour categories, and derived (intersective) colour categories.\n\nFirst, there are the six primary colours recognized in the widely accepted theory of colour opponency (Hering 1964 [1920], Jameson and Hurvich 1968; Hurvich 1982):\n\nBlack\n\nWhite\n\nRed\n\nYellow\n\nGreen\n\nBlue\n\nThese are the two pairs of fundamental opponent chromatic colours <Red, Green> and <Yellow, Blue> and the single pair of fundamental achromatic colours <Black, White>. Black and white are not opposed in the same sense as the chromatic pairs. For example, we can see a combination of black and white (gray) but there is no sensation consisting of the combination of red and green or of blue and yellow. (That blue and yellow pigments can be mixed to produce a green pigment is not relevant; there are no bluish yellow or yellowish blue sensations.)\n\nWe will refer to the six colours black, white, red, yellow, green and blue as primaries.\n\nSecondly, there are composite categories consisting of fuzzy unions of the primaries. (Colour categories are modeled as fuzzy sets, that is, sets whose membership is a matter of more or less. For non-technical discussion of fuzzy sets, fuzzy intersection, fuzzy union, and related concepts in relation to colour categories, see Kay and McDaniel (1978); for technical discussion of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, see Zadeh (1996).)\n\nBy far the most widespread composite in the ethnographic present is green-or-blue or \"grue\" (see Map 134A). Over half the languages in the World Color Survey contain a grue term. Other major composite terms documented in the World Color Survey are, using \"/\" for fuzzy union, Black/Green/Blue, White/Red/Yellow, Black/Blue, Red/Yellow, Yellow/Green/Blue, and Yellow/Green. (There is one, somewhat unclear, instance of a probable White/Yellow term in Waorani, an isolate of Ecuador.)\n\nThere are also what we might call minor composites. For example, in systems that lack terms for purple and brown, these colours are often included in the black term. Similarly, in systems restricted to the primaries, non-primary shades such as brown, purple, pink, orange and gray are characteristically either split between two adjacent primaries or covered by a single adjacent primary.\n\nThe third type of widespread colour category are the derived (intersective) categories, which are experienced as mixtures of the primaries. These are based formally on fuzzy intersections of primaries. Gray is experienced as a mixture of Black and White, pink of White and Red, orange of Yellow and Red, purple of Blue and Red, and brown (arguably) of Yellow and Black.\n\n3. An evolutionary sequence of basic colour systems\n\nFigure 1 presents both a typology and an evolutionary sequence of basic colour systems covering 101 of the 110 World Color Survey languages. (The colour lexicons of the remaining nine languages are composed mostly of terms denoting categories appearing in Figure 1. Limits of space preclude further discussion here; see Kay and Maffi 1999.)\n\nBasic colour lexicon types are shown in square brackets and evolutionary stages are represented by columns, labeled with Roman numerals. For example, stage I contains a single type, consisting of two terms, one a composite of White, Red and Yellow and the other a composite of Black, Green, and Blue. (There are no stage I languages in the World Color Survey sample. Stage I is shown here for theoretical completeness.)\n\nArrows indicate observed evolutionary transitions between types. Arabic numerals within brackets indicate the number of World Color Survey languages conforming to the corresponding colour lexicon type. Arabic numerals placed between basic colour lex"}

On the other, there were no serious, factually-grounded criticisms of the war, despite a diverse panel which included people who did not support it.\n\nAs author of a major book on the war and its historical context, Behind the War on Terror: Western Secret Strategy and the Struggle for Iraq, as well as co-author of a new report, Executive Decisions: How British Intelligence was Hijacked for the Iraq War, I consider myself to be reasonably informed. Yet BBC Newsnight failed almost entirely to bring any of these issues to light.\n\nWhat follows is my Newsnight-inspired Iraq War Myth-Busting exercise, based on what was, and wasn't, discussed on the show.\n\nMYTH 1. Sectarian violence has increased in postwar Iraq because sectarianism has always existed in Iraq, and the removal of Saddam allowed it to erupt\n\nOne of the first Newsnight bloopers started with a short introductory clip from John Simpson, the BBC's World Affairs Editor. Amongst other things, Simpson talked about the rise of sectarian Sunni-Shi'a violence in postwar Iraq, and argued that while Saddam's regime had clamped down on sectarian divisions, regime change effectively unleashed those previously suppressed divisions and allowed them to worsen.\n\nThis was the first of many oversimplifications about the escalation of sectarian violence in Iraq. The reality, as pointed out on the show by my colleague in the audience, anthropologist Professor Nadje al-Ali, is that prior to the war, generic sectarian antagonism was unheard of in Iraqi society. Although Saddam's regime was unequivocally sectarian in its own violence against Shi'as and Kurds, as a mechanism of shoring up the Ba'athist regime, Iraqis did not largely identify in sectarian terms. As one Iraqi blogger living in Baghdad noted:\n\n\"I always hear the Iraqi pro-war crowd interviewed on television from foreign capitals (they can only appear on television from the safety of foreign capitals because I defy anyone to be publicly pro-war in Iraq)\u2026 They go on and on about Iraq's history and how Sunnis and Shia were always in conflict and I hate that. I hate that a handful of expats who haven't been to the country in decades pretend to know more about it than people actually living there. I remember Baghdad before the war- one could live anywhere. We didn't know what our neighbors were- we didn't care. No one asked about religion or sect. No one bothered with what was considered a trivial topic: are you Sunni or Shia? You only asked something like that if you were uncouth and backward. Our lives revolve around it now. Our existence depends on hiding it or highlighting it- depending on the group of masked men who stop you or raid your home in the middle of the night.\"\n\nMissing from the BBC Newsnight discussion was the fact that the Bush administration planned from the outset to dominate Iraq by pursuing the de facto ethnic partition of the country into three autonomous cantons. The private US intelligence firm, Stratfor, reported that the US was \"working on a plan to merge Iraq and Jordan into a unitary kingdom to be ruled by the Hashemite dynasty headed by King Abdullah of Jordan.\" The plan was \"authored by US Vice President Dick Cheney\" as well as \"Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz\", and was first discussed at \"an unusual meeting between Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan and pro-US Iraqi Sunni opposition members in London in July\" 2002.\n\nUnder this plan, the central and largest part of Iraq populated largely by Sunnis would be joined with Jordan, and would include Baghdad, which would no longer be the capital. The Kurdish region of northern and northwestern Iraq, including Mosul and the vast Kirkuk oilfields, would become its own autonomous state. The Shi'a region in southwestern Iraq, including Basra, would make up the third canton, or more likely it would be joined with Kuwait.\n\n\nUltimately, of course, the specific detail of this plan did not come to fruition \u2013 but the 'divide-and-rule' imperial thinking behind the plan was implemented. As one US Joint Special Operations University report documented, \"US elite forces in Iraq turned to fostering infighting among their Iraqi adversaries on the tactical and operational level.\" This included disseminating and propagating al-Qaeda jihadi activities by \"US psychological warfare (PSYOP) specialists\" to fuel \"factional fighting\" and \"to set insurgents battling insurgents.\"\n\nPakistani defence sources thus reported in early 2005 that the Pentagon"}

Students in his graduate virtual reality course \u2014 from both the Jonsson School and the School of Arts, Technology, and Emerging Communication \u2014 created three distinct virtual environment prototypes for MyndVR's target audience. They include a nightclub complete with a live singer, an immersive sudoku game set above a koi pond, and a set of serene day and night environments ranging from mountains, lakes and beaches to the Taj Mahal.\n\nThree Tiers of Content\n\nChris Brickler, co-founder and CEO of MyndVR, said his company's initial intention was to focus on a broad-spectrum, quality-of-life approach across a network of more than 50 long-term care and retirement facilities.\n\n\"Our product road map envisions three tiers of content,\" Brickler said. \"The first layer is recreational content \u2014 going to the Great Wall, swimming with dolphins and the like. Next would be therapeutic content \u2014 music, nature and brain exercises.\n\n\"The top level, the uncharted water, is prescriptive digital therapy. MyndVR's goal is to provide virtual reality content customized to a user's diagnosis. That's why we're so excited about working with UTD on not only the development of the VR, but also the cognitive implications.\"\n\nFor many students in McMahan's VR class, the MyndVR project was their first experience with an external stakeholder.\n\nUT Dallas graduate student Ariel Comstock and assistant professor Dr. Ryan McMahan (right) are playing key roles in the work of MyndVR co-founder and CEO Chris Brickler (left). Comstock coordinated four MyndVR trials at facilities around the country, and students in McMahan's VR class created content for the company's target audience.\n\n\"Our partnership with MyndVR gave my students experience with a real company and real objectives,\" he said. \"That collaboration was successful enough that MyndVR recruited one of those students as their first employee. She coordinated four MyndVR trials at facilities around the country.\"\n\nThat employee \u2014 Ariel Comstock, a master's of fine arts student in ATEC \u2014 emphasized the role the VR experience can play in empowering MyndVR's audience.\n\n\"MyndVR transports a viewer mentally away for the duration of the experience, and they finish feeling like they went somewhere,\" Comstock said. \"For people who are not as agile as they once were, it can give them a sense of confidence, of agency \u2014 they choose where they want to go, and then go there.\"\n\nIn conducting MyndVR's trials in Kansas, Florida, California and Texas \u2014 working with more than 250 seniors from ages 70 to 100 \u2014 Comstock has seen the extreme emotions that these programs can evoke.\n\n\"I see wonder, awe and elation, but sometimes tears and sadness too,\" Comstock said. \"I've also seen immersion to the extent that a senior who was experiencing 'MyMusic' \u2014 the 1950s nightclub \u2014 threw up her hands and sang along with 'New York, New York,' waving her arms as if she were performing herself.\"\n\nBrian Barnes, CFO/COO of The Legacy Senior Communities, observed similar effects during the trial at Willow Bend, a continuing care retirement community in Plano.\n\n\"The MyndVR trial demonstrated a variety of benefits,\" Barnes said. \"In one case, a resident living with Alzheimer's exhibited personality traits she had prior to the diagnosis, including dancing, smiling and singing. Another resident felt relief from symptoms of Parkinson's. The overall response has impressed everyone involved.\"\n\n"}

{"id": 363, "ended": true, "length": 680, "text": "A bill to create an athletic commission in South Dakota is going nowhere fast, largely thanks to the ignorance of Gov. Dennis Daugaard and state house Rep. Steve Hickey.\n\nTheir primary objective is to ban sanctioned mixed martial arts in the state. In a blog post, Hickey writes that, \"MMA Cage Fighting is the child porn of sports.\"\n\nThe lack of knowledge and the lack of research both Daugaard and Hickey showed about MMA has to be frightening for persons who live in South Dakota. If they can't be bothered to do the minimal research required to learn that MMA is far safer than other \"mainstream\" sports, including football, it's scary to think about the laws they'll pass in the state regarding education, health care and budgets.\n\nThe UFC is the largest MMA promoter in the world. No fighter has ever suffered traumatic brain injury, let alone died, in the UFC's 20-year history. A 2006 study done by researchers at Johns Hopkins University and which appeared in the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine found MMA has far less traumatic brain injury than other sports.\n\nMixed Martial Arts competitions have changed dramatically since the first Ultimate Fighting Championship in 1993. The overall injury rate in MMA competitions is now similar to other combat sports, including boxing. Knockout rates are lower in MMA competitions than in boxing. This suggests a reduced risk of TBI [traumatic brain injury] in MMA competitions when compared to other events involving striking. MMA events must continue to be properly supervised by trained referees and ringside physicians, and the rules implemented by state sanctioning\u2014including weight classes, limited rounds per match, proper safety gear, and banning of the most devastating attacks\u2013 must be strictly enforced. Further research is necessary to continue to improve safety in this developing new sport.\n\nA 2008 study released by the British Journal of Sports Medicine reached the same conclusions. After a five-year study, its authors wrote:\n\nInjury rates in regulated professional MMA competition are similar to other combat sports; the overall risk of critical sports-related injury appears low. Additional study is warranted to achieve a better understanding of injury trends and ways to further lower injury risk in MMA.\n\nThe simple fact is that a random NFL player is at far greater risk of a serious brain injury than is a random MMA fighter. Sadly, neither Gov. Daugaard nor Rep. Hickey bothered to do much investigation or educate themselves before speaking out.\n\nSouth Dakota state house Rep. Mark Johnston introduced a bill to create an athletic commission in the state for the express purpose of making the sport safer. According to the Argus Leader, Johnston said his goal is to prevent unregulated events where tragedies could possibly occur.\n\nA state athletic commission's job is, at the core, to protect the fighters. It makes sure the proposed matches are fair and that promoters have doctors and an ambulance at all events. The commissions also require qualified referees, who stop fights when one fighter is in danger. It also requires fighters to undergo extensive medical examinations before fighting to make certain they are fit to compete. States such as Nevada, California and New York, with strong commissions, have discovered injuries fighters didn't know they had and prevented them from competing. That wouldn't be the case in South Dakota, with no commission to require those tests.\n\nStory Continues"}

That all changes on September 7 when a firmware update will add five of DJI's Intelligent Flight Modes to those models.\n\nThese modes include waypoint navigation, point of interest (POI) flight planning and a Follow Me function. Waypoint navigation lets you set up a multipoint path for the drone to follow while you control the camera angle, and paths can be saved so you can recreate the flight again and again.\n\nPOI flight planning allows you to set up an autonomous orbit around a subject at an altitude, distance and speed you select. The Phantom 3 will fly the path keeping the camera centered on your subject at all times.\n\nFollow Me uses the drone's transmitter and your phone or tablet to track your movements. This lets you use a Phantom 3 as a personal camera operator as it follows you at a fixed altitude and distance while you do whatever. Keep in mind, though, it won't avoid obstacles, so riding a bike trail through the woods probably won't end well.\n\nJoshua Goldman/CNET\n\nAlso available are Course and Home Lock modes. The former makes all flight controls relative to your current position. That means moving the controller's stick left, right, forward or back will always move the Phantom 3 in those directions, regardless of where the camera is pointing.\n\nSimilarly, enabling the Home Lock mode will make the orientation relative to yourself as the home point. This is helpful if you've flown beyond line of sight and want to return home but can't determine the orientation.\n\nPhantom 3 Advanced owners get a bonus, too: The firmware upgrade will add 2.7K (2,704x1,520-pixel) resolution movie capture at 30 frames per second.\n\nLastly, a firmware update will also be available for the professional-level Inspire 1 that will add all of these Intelligent Flight Modes except for Follow Me.\n\nCatch all the electronics news from this week's show in Berlin."}

The king of Smash 4, with the coaching assist of Immortals' Jason \"ANTi\" Bates, walked out of Atlantic City as the victor of both the singles and doubles (with NRG eSports' Nairoby \"Nairo\" Quezada) tournaments.\n\nAlthough ZeRo took down the singles title, the journey was not easy or dominant. The competition, and some newer names, continued to creep up to contend with great finishes from Phoenix1's Gavin \"Tweek\" Dempsey, James \"VoiD\" Makekau-Tyson and Ramin \"Mr.R\" Delshad. Mr.R was the standout competitor from the field. The Sheik main used Cloud in the grand finals against ZeRo and was one scramble decision away from taking down the entire tournament. ZeRo needed a clutch ledge fight and multiple comeback decisions to overcome the relentless reads and pressure from Mr.R. It will be up to Mr.R to overcome the ZeRo hump (the pair played most recently at CEO Dreamland, another close affair) and take over the iron throne.\n\nThe main event was Super Smash Bros. Melee and the top eight featured four of the best players in the world: Alliance's Adam \"Armada\" Lindgren, Team Liquid's Juan \"Hungrybox\" Debiedma, Cloud9's Joseph \"Mango\" Marquez and Team SoloMid's William \"Leffen\" Hjelte. Three of those listed were Evolution Fighting Game Championship winners and the other, Leffen, was routinely billed as the next legend in the game. Unfortunately for Leffen, his tournament was cut short by Hungrybox in a nail-biter set and a 3-0 drubbing by Sami \"DruggedFox\" Muhanna. In addition to eliminating Leffen, DruggedFox ran through Splyce's Michael \"Nintendude\" Brancato en route to a respectable fourth place finish.\n\nThe storyline of the main event was once again centered around three of the game's most legendary competitors; Armada, Hungrybox, and Mango renewed their rivalries and took up the top three spots in the tournament. Hungrybox started in the winners bracket, but fell to rival Armada and Mango in winners finals and losers finals respectively. Mango, in signature fashion, fought through the losers bracket to enter the grand finals against Armada.\n\nIn the grand finals, Armada shut down Mango's unorthodox offensive approaches. His defensive neutral air attacks, floats and ledge guards were so stout that Mango opted to use Marth on Final Destination for one game (he lost). It took unrelenting and fearless progression, but Mango created enough scramble situations to reset the bracket. In the final set, both players played to a fifth game stalemate. There, on Fountain of Dreams, Mango took his only decisive game. With the crowd behind him, and Armada seemingly out of steam, Mango lost only two stocks to finish the comeback victory."}

As well as Arctic Canada, Inuit also live in northern Alaska and Greenland, and have close relatives in Russia. They are united by a common cultural heritage and a common language. Until recently, outsiders called the Inuit \"Eskimo.\" Now they prefer their own term, \"Inuit,\" meaning simply \"people.\" There are about 40,000 Inuit in Canada.\n\nInuit Origins\n\nAccording to archaeological research, the origins of the Inuit lie in north-western Alaska. These first Alaskan Inuit lived on the seacoast and tundra, where they hunted seals, walrus, whales, and caribou. They lived in houses made of driftwood and sod, and almost certainly spoke an early version of the Inuit language, Inuktitut. They and their ancestors were the first Arctic people to become expert at hunting the larger sea mammals, such as the bowhead whale. The large volume of food that resulted from a successful hunt\u2014even a small whale could weigh seven tonnes-meant that their way of life was richer and more secure than that of many other hunting people.\n\nThe Inuit Move East\n\nBeginning about a thousand years ago, these early Inuit began to spread east into Arctic Canada. Within a few hundred years, they had replaced the earlier inhabitants of the region, a now-extinct people known to the Inuit as Tunit. This Inuit migration was not a single mass event, but probably involved dozens of small parties of perhaps 20 or 30 people moving east in search of a better life.\n\nA particular goal seems to have been the rich whaling grounds around Baffin and Somerset islands. Here they quickly replicated the large whaling villages and prosperous way of life they had left behind in Alaska. Other groups settled in coastal areas without rich whale resources, where they lived in smaller villages and depended primarily upon seals, caribou and fish. Everywhere they went, Inuit pioneers brought with them the heavy sod winter houses and elaborate hunting technology of their Alaskan ancestors.\n\nThe Inuit and the Vikings\n\nBy about AD1250, the first Inuit had entered Greenland through the Smith Sound area in the far northwest of the island. Here, possibly on the Canadian side, they first encountered medieval Norse (\"Viking\") hunters coming from the Norse colonies in southwest Greenland founded by Eric the Red. Eventually these Norse colonies disappeared, probably in the mid 1400s. There are different theories about their disappearance, but a deteriorating climate was one reason. Competition with the Inuit, who were far better adapted to Arctic life than the Norse, might also have been a factor. By the time of later European exploration in the 16th century, the Inuit were in sole possession of the entire North American Arctic.\n\nA Colder Climate\n\nThe same worsening climate that spelled the end of the Norse colonies in Greenland also put severe strains on the Inuit economy. After about 1300, temperatures became progressively colder culminating in a so-called Little Ice Age around 1500. Rich and important whaling areas in the High Arctic were abandoned and people shifted southward.\n\nBowhead whaling as the focus of Inuit life disappeared from most of Canada and Greenland (although not Alaska). Life generally became harder and more hand-to-mouth. People moved their camps and villages more frequently, and, in many areas, the old sod and whalebone winter house was abandoned in favour of houses made of blocks of snow. They were easier to build as they could be put up anywhere, even on the sea ice, and required only an hour or two to construct.\n\nContact with Explorers\n\nContact with European explorers also brought changes. Between the voyages of Martin Frobisher in the 1570s and the search for the missing Franklin expedition in the 1850s, dozens of expeditions to the Arctic set sail, usually from England. Most of them were in search of a Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\n\nAt first, Europeans did not see the Arctic as a place of value in itself, but as an obstacle blocking their way to the fortunes beyond. During their journeys through the North, European explorers often met Inuit. Few Europeans were unprejudiced enough to think they had anything to learn from the Inuit, but they did trade and exchange gifts. The Inuit began to learn about the outside world and to appreciate what it had to offer. The Europeans brought them iron, which they valued for making tools such as harpoon points and knife blades.\n\nThe Whalers\n\nIn the 1850s, Europeans and Americans began to appreciate the commercial value of the Arctic's animal resources. The North Atlantic commercial whaling industry, operating out of Britain and New England, began large-scale operations in what are"}

Why did Willie Sutton rob banks?\n\nIn a party-line decision, the Democrat-dominated National Labor Relations Board has decided that employees of contractors can be treated as employees of other companies when . . . well, when it is convenient for Democratic constituencies that they be so treated. The underlying case involved an operator of recycling centers, Browning-Ferris Industries of California, which uses subcontractors to staff some of its facilities. Firms have many reasons for using subcontracted labor, one of which is avoiding entanglement with the NLRB. Tut-tut, say the feds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the more relevant cases, contracting is built into the business model, as it is with franchise restaurants and similar businesses, which are what this case really is about. Most people who work for McDonald's do not actually work for McDonald's Corporation, which operates only a small number of the burger joints bearing its name. The overwhelming majority of McDonald's restaurants are franchises, independent businesses ranging from one-shop outfits to very large operations, the owners of which pay a fee to McDonald's for the use of its name, business model, and supply chain. Your local fry-guy was not hired by McDonald's, cannot be fired by McDonald's, is not paid by McDonald's, and is not supervised by McDonald's. His terms of employment are not set by McDonald's but by his employer, the franchise operator. He is not an employee of McDonald's in any meaningful sense, but the Democrats on the NLRB are not interested in sense \u2014 they are interested in power.\n\nUnion membership, particularly in the private sector, has been declining for decades. There are fewer than 8 million private-sector workers in unions, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By way of comparison, there already are more than 2 million American workers employed in the so-called gig economy, working mainly as private contractors and individual entrepreneurs through firms such as Uber and AirBnB. It is very likely that within a few years there will be more Lyft drivers than Teamsters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Get Free Exclusive NR Content\n\nThe political fallout of declining union membership presents a mortal threat to the Left's operating coalition. It's not just because of the money-laundering that converts union dues into Democratic campaign contributions, though that's not nothing; rather, it is that if fewer firms and economic sectors are under political discipline, then the value of being the party of government declines. When fewer firms are covered by, say, NLRB rules, then the political premium attached to being the rule-maker is diminished. Thus, the Left is scrambling to keep unionized firms under the federal thumb \u2014 consider the NLRB's improper attack on Boeing \u2014 while laboring to open up new avenues of union membership. Illinois insisted that privately employed home-health-care workers were \"public employees\" required to pay dues to the SEIU simply because their clients were Medicare recipients, a risible claim rightly thrown out by the Supreme Court (5\u20134, of course; liberal jurists are liberals first, jurists second if at all).\n\nThe NLRB's ruling empowers the federal government to designate companies as \"joint employers\" on the flimsiest of grounds. For example, a corporation that requires all its franchisee owners to use the same scheduling software could be considered a joint employer for that reason alone.\n\nThis is about enabling labor activists to exercise power over large businesses that are, for the moment, largely beyond their grasp.\n\nThe NLRB and labor activists say that this ruling is necessary because in recent decades practices such as subcontracting and franchising have allowed many businesses to insulate themselves from direct NLRB oversight. This is true, and in many cases the avoidance of federal micromanagement almost certainly was an animating force. If the NLRB expects that businesses will sit still after this ruling, it is engaged in self-delusion: One of the few reliable effects of centralized regulation is that businesses will invest, and sometimes invest heavily, in regulation avoidance.\n\nThere is probably no set of sustainable economic arrangements that will allow a single-parent fast-food employee to raise two children in the same comfort and security that might be provided by, say, a couple of married professionals. But the employees are incidental: This is about enabling labor activists to exercise power over large businesses that are, for the moment, largely beyond their grasp. Congress, happily, has the power to set aside this implausible overreach, which is exactly what it should do."}

{"id": 373, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "During a sophomore season that saw Tyler Seguin come up a goal shy of 30 and three points shy of 70, he finally turned 20. He had become a Stanley Cup champion the year before, in 2011, and seemed on the verge of making the leap from good to great.\n\nWhen that didn't happen the following season - he put up 32 points in 48 games, followed by an uninspiring eight points in 22 playoff games - the Bruins sent him packing to Dallas. This is what's known in hockey circles as an \"organizational oopsie.\"\n\nFast forward a year, and I feel comfortable floating out a few questions: could Tyler Seguin lead the NHL in scoring one season? If so, how soon? Could it be this season?\n\nYou likely noticed that the young center had a nice year with Dallas, but \"nice year\" doesn't really do it justice. He finished alone in fourth in the NHL with 84 points, and helped make up one of the most dynamic duos in hockey alongside Jamie Benn. He took 294 shots (fourth-most in the league), leading to 37 goals on a wholly sustainable 12.6% shooting percentage (sustainable for an elite shooter like Seguin, that is). He got a step faster and noticeably stronger; it wasn't luck.\n\nHis possession stats were also shiny, for those so inclined. He saw a 52.3% share of the shot attempts while he was on the ice, and pushed that to 61.8% in playoffs - a time when he undeniably would have been the focal point of the opposition. Pushing through and improving on his already great regular season performance implies he's a player with the drive the Bruins implied he wasn't.\n\nSeguin is going to have even more help this season. Occupying the spot largely filled by Rich Peverley and then-rookie Valeri Nichushkin last season will likely be Ales Hemsky, a skilled disher whose likely to maximize the output of two pure shooters.\n\nBenn himself will be 25 and fully into his scoring prime while coming off a season that saw him represent Team Canada and set career highs in [fill in a category of your choice]. That won't hurt much, nor will Dallas having some young D-men that look poised to take a step in the right direction.\n\nStatistics show that elite scorers peak earlier than most fans think, but that tends to mean somewhere around 24-25, not 27-28.\n\nAt 22, Seguin is just on the verge of sliding into his prime - a crazy concept for a guy who just finished with more points than names like Alex Ovechkin, Corey Perry and Jonathan Toews.\n\nClearing the obvious hurdle\n\nOh, right. Reigning \"World's Best Hockey Human\" Sidney Crosby still exists. That's a bit more than a speed bump.\n\nI'm not naive enough to believe that Seguin is going to suddenly make up the 20 points Crosby beat him by this past season, but there are some reasons to believe he could substantially close that gap, and hope for a little luck.\n\nFor starters, Crosby's linemates are only getting older, which means they ain't getting better - and might be getting worse.\n\nChris Kunitz will be 35 this year, which is well into the years of statistical decline for scorers. Kunitz was above a point per game in the lockout shortened year, and he was 10 points under it last season; his fall-off might be underway as we speak. Pascal Dupuis is 35 with a huge career games played total as a guy who's only topped 50 points once.\n\nUnless Sid is tied to Evgeni Malkin he won't have a ton of help, and if the Pens hope to present themselves as a team with real depth, they're probably best keeping their two elite centers separated.\n\nThe other factor here, is that Crosby's had some well publicized injury trouble in his career. You hope it never befalls Sid again, but Seguin has only missed 11 career games over four NHL seasons. If the Pens captain runs into any more trouble, the league leaders list will be there for the taking - and ol' Ty-Ty has proven pretty durable.\n\nObviously Seguin wouldn't be alone in the chase for the Art Ross. Taylor Hall is at an almost identical place in his career, though playing on a worse team probably makes topping the league scorers list harder (as does his more reckless style, in terms of games played). Malkin and Patrick Kane both missed substantial playing time last year, with the former being a legit threat for the league's top spot when healthy. If Claude Giroux gets off to anything other than an atrocious start like last year, he showed he can be better than a point-per-game guy.\n\nBut there's little doubt that Seguin now warrants mention with the guys listed"}

Every year more than 15 million tons of cargo \u2013 predominantly oil, grains and fertilisers \u2013 are processed through the anchorage areas in the strait. More than 95% of this volume comprises Russian-origin commodities shipped from ports on the Volga and Don Rivers and the Caspian Basin by coaster ships, which is then transshipped onto large ocean-going vessels.\n\nTransshipment in the Kerch Strait has faced a number of natural, political and legal issues over the years. The relatively shallow waters of the strait do not allow for safe passage of Panamax and Capesize vessels when fully laden. Moreover, a tangle of legal conflicts and loopholes has turned the strait into a 'grey zone', with the biggest problem being the strait's lack of clear legal status.\n\nIn accordance with Article 15 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982, where the coasts of two states are opposite or adjacent to one another, neither state is entitled (failing agreement between them to the contrary) to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line, every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines from which the breadth of both states' territorial seas are measured. This provision does not apply where it is necessary, by reason of historic title or other special circumstances, to delimit the territorial seas of the two states in a way that is at odds with the convention.\n\nThe Kerch Strait is a special case, as it is impossible to delimit the territorial waters at the median line. Therefore, the status of the strait has been determined by special agreements between Ukraine and Russia. The Treaty between Ukraine and the Russian Federation on Cooperation in the Use of the Azov Sea and Kerch Strait stipulates that the \u200b\u200bAzov Sea and the Kerch Strait have historically been the internal waters of both Ukraine and Russia, and that the settlement of all issues related to the Kerch Strait is to be carried out by agreement between the two countries. The border between Ukraine and Russia has not yet been officially demarcated.\n\nIn practice, this means that neither Ukraine nor Russia has full jurisdiction and control over the strait. This lacuna has led to the development of ship-to-ship transshipment and bunkering on anchorage places in the strait. Some of these anchorage areas are located within the Ukrainian zone of responsibility, while others are in zones controlled by Russia.\n\nAlthough Ukrainian authorities have control over anchorages in respect of vessel traffic and navigational safety, they do not have territorial jurisdiction over the areas defined as 'transit anchorage places'. Anchorage areas are not included in the water areas of Ukrainian ports, so no state control procedures govern them. These anchorage areas are not a part of Ukrainian customs or state territory. Thus, technically all operations are arranged outside Ukrainian borders.\n\nThe obvious advantage for shipowners and cargo shippers is that transshipment and bunkering operations are undertaken under a 'transit' regime, thus avoiding customs clearance, border control and other types of government surveillance. This also allows for bunkering and transshipment without formally calling the vessels at port \u2013 therefore avoiding both payment of port charges and the need to obtain free practice for vessels.\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian authorities have recently attempted to take control over transshipment on transit anchorages. In June 2013 the Cabinet of Ministers passed a decree that the anchorage areas within the Ukrainian zone of responsibility be included in the official water area of the port of Kerch. In view of international law and the bilateral treaties between Ukraine and Russia, the validity of this decree may be dubious.\n\nFollowing the decree, the State Customs Service required that thorough customs control be exerted over all transshipment operations undertaken by vessels in anchorage areas. The customs authorities insist that the anchorage areas in the Kerch Strait fall within Ukrainian customs territory. However, considering the legal status of the strait as the 'internal waters of Ukraine and Russia', and in the absence of demarcated borders in the strait, this requirement is questionable in terms of territorial jurisdiction. Despite the fact that there are neither legal grounds nor effective fulfilment mechanisms for this requirement, the authorities are likely to continue attempts to expand their jurisdiction over the anchorages. In practice, this implies the abolition of the existing transit regime and the loss of all incentives for ship-to-ship transshipment in Ukrainian anchorage areas.\n\nThe Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority recently initiated a series of lawsuits against shipping agents in an attempt to recover unpaid port charges for the vessels which operated in anchorage transshipment zones after the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers came into force. The reasoning given was that all anchorages fall within the remit of port waters, and are thus subject to port charges."}

Federal law grants certain rights and protections to people with disabilities who use guide dogs or service dogs.\n\nAccess to Public Places and the ADA\n\nDifferent laws govern the use of service animals in different contexts. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) governs the use of service dogs in public places.\n\nThe ADA guarantees people with disabilities who use service dogs equal access to public places such as restaurants, hospitals, hotels, theaters, shops, and government buildings. This means that these places must allow service dogs, and the ADA requires them to modify their practices to accommodate the dogs, if necessary.\n\nHowever, these protections only apply to dogs that satisfy the ADA's definition of \"service animal.\" The ADA defines a service animal as a dog that is \"individually trained\" to \"perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability.\" The tasks a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person's disability.\n\nA \"helper monkey\" or a cat cannot be considered a service animal under the ADA; the ADA limits the definition of service animals to dogs. In some limited circumstances, the ADA provides that public places should also accomodate persons with disabilities who use miniature horses to perform tasks.\n\nThe best-known example of service dogs are guide dogs that help blind people navigate safely around obstacles. Service dogs can also be trained to assist deaf individuals, wheelchair-users and other people with mobility impairments, as well as people who have psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disabilities.\n\nPsychiatric Service Dogs\n\n\"Psychiatric service dogs\" are service dogs that provide assistance to people with psychiatric disabilities, such as severe depression, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nExamples of work or tasks that psychiatric service dogs perform include:\n\nproviding safety checks or room searches for individuals with PTSD\n\nblocking persons in dissociative episodes from wandering into danger (for example, traffic), and\n\npreventing or interrupting impulsive or destructive behaviors, such as self-mutilation.\n\nEmotional Support Animals\n\nMany individuals\u2014both with and without disabilities\u2014derive emotional support and comfort from dogs and other animals that are not specially trained to perform specific tasks directly related to a psychiatric disability.\n\nThe ADA considers such \"emotional support animals\" to be distinct from psychiatric service dogs, and treats them differently. The ADA does not grant emotional support dog owners the same right of access to public places that it gives to individuals who use psychiatric service dogs. That means that under the ADA, a movie theater, for example, must allow psychiatric service dogs to accompany their owners into the movie auditorium but can refuse to admit individuals with emotional support dogs.\n\nThe Difference Between a Psychiatric Service Dog and an Emotional Support Dog\n\nIt is not always clear\u2014to staff at public places, and even to some people with disabilities\u2014whether an animal accompanying an individual with a psychiatric disability or impairment is performing a psychiatric service or \"merely\" providing emotional support. Confusion may result in unlawful and discriminatory treatment of people with disabilities.\n\nThe key distinction to remember is that a psychiatric service animal is actually trained to perform certain tasks that are directly related to an individual's psychiatric disability. The dog's primary role is not to provide emotional support. It is to assist the owner with the accomplishment of vital tasks they otherwise would not be able to perform independently. In addition, a psychiatric service dog must not only respond to an owner's need for help, the dog must also be trained to recognize the need for help in the first place. A dog must be able to respond and recognize to be a service dog.\n\nBy contrast, an emotional support dog is a pet that is not trained to perform specific acts directly related to an individual's psychiatric disability. Instead, the pet's owner simply derives a sense of well-being, safety, or calm from the dog's companionship and physical presence.\n\nThe animal companionship of an emotional support dog can have genuine therapeutic benefits for individuals with psychiatric disabilities and less severe mental impairments. But unless the dog is also trained to work\u2014to independently recognize and respond to its owner's psychiatric disability\u2014the dog does not qualify as a psychiatric service dog and does not receive the protections of the ADA.\n\nFor example, people with social phobia might only feel safe enough to leave their home for food or medication if their dog accompanies them. Such a dog would be considered an emotional support animal.\n\nIf, however, the same person is prone to dissociative episodes when they leave home, and their dog is trained to recognize and respond to the onset of such an episode by nudging, barking, or removing the individual to a safe location, then the dog would be considered a psychiatric service dog.\n\nDifferent State Laws"}

Today, I want to discuss our plans to focus our talent and investments in areas where we have differentiation and potential for growth, as well as how we'll partner to drive better scale and results. In all we do, we will take a long-term view and build deep technical capability that allows us to innovate in the future.\n\nWith that context, I want to update you on decisions impacting our phone business and share more on last week's mapping and display advertising announcements.\n\nWe anticipate that these changes, in addition to other headcount alignment changes, will result in the reduction of up to 7,800 positions globally, primarily in our phone business. We expect that the reductions will take place over the next several months.\n\nI don't take changes in plans like these lightly, given that they affect the lives of people who have made an impact at Microsoft. We are deeply committed to helping our team members through these transitions.\n\nPhones. Today, we announced a fundamental restructuring of our phone business. As a result, the company will take an impairment charge of approximately $7.6 billion related to assets associated with the acquisition of the Nokia Devices and Services business in addition to a restructuring charge of approximately $750 million to $850 million.\n\nI am committed to our first-party devices including phones. However, we need to focus our phone efforts in the near term while driving reinvention. We are moving from a strategy to grow a standalone phone business to a strategy to grow and create a vibrant Windows ecosystem that includes our first-party device family.\n\nIn the near term, we will run a more effective phone portfolio, with better products and speed to market given the recently formed Windows and Devices Group. We plan to narrow our focus to three customer segments where we can make unique contributions and where we can differentiate through the combination of our hardware and software. We'll bring business customers the best management, security and productivity experiences they need; value phone buyers the communications services they want; and Windows fans the flagship devices they'll love.\n\nIn the longer term, Microsoft devices will spark innovation, create new categories and generate opportunity for the Windows ecosystem more broadly. Our reinvention will be centered on creating mobility of experiences across the entire device family including phones.\n\nMapping. Last week, we announced changes to our mapping business and transferred some of our imagery acquisition operations to Uber. We will continue to source base mapping data and imagery from partners. This allows us to focus our efforts on delivering great map products such as Bing Maps, Maps app for Windows and our Bing Maps for Enterprise APIs.\n\nAdvertising. We also announced our decision to sharpen our focus in advertising platform technology and concentrate on search, while we partner with AOL and AppNexus for display. Bing will now power search and search advertising across the AOL portfolio of sites, in addition to the partnerships we already have with Yahoo!, Amazon and Apple. Concentrating on search will help us further accelerate the progress we've been making over the past six years. Last year Bing grew to 20 percent query share in the U.S. while growing our search advertising revenue 28 percent over the past 12 months. We view search technology as core to our efforts spanning Bing.com, Cortana, Office 365, Windows 10 and Azure services.\n\nI deeply appreciate all of the ideas and hard work of everyone involved in these businesses, and I want to reiterate my commitment to helping each individual impacted.\n\nI know many of you have questions about these changes. I will host an employee Q&A tomorrow to share more, and I hope you can join me.\n\nSatya"}

When you get down to the nitty-gritty details, it is not really the same as mechanical cutting.\n\nRemember that lasers shoot photons, and when photons hit atoms, they excite electrons. If you excite these electrons enough, they'll have enough energy to disassociate from the atoms they formerly \"belonged\" to. This makes individual atoms disassociate with whatever other atoms they were once bonded to, and in the mad scramble to go to a lower energy state, they very likely do not go into the same configuration they were before. Some atoms, like the ones directly hit by the laser beam, go to a vapor and float away. Others \"choose\" one side of the material to go to. Any bonds the material had with itself is then dissolved, so it is effectively cut.\n\nThis is different than, say, taking shears or scissors to the material.

You may think that the standard brush sizes in MSPaint only come in the three sizes, right? Wrong.\n\nOpen up a new document in paint, select the paintbrush tool, hold Ctrl and press the + button on the numpad. The brush size will grow as big as you need! Amazing, huh?\n\nThis technique also works with the line tool, the spraypaint tool, and the eraser tool.\n\nChapter 2 - Custom Brushes\n\nThis is the one that NOBODY knows - You can make your own custom brushes in paint! Select the pencil tool and draw yourself a small textured brush in X color.\n\nHere's what I did:\n\nNow, select that little image, turn transparency on, hold shift, and drag it around!\n\nCool, huh? You can draw ANYTHING and do this. Here's another one I did.\n\nChapter 2 1/2 - The 'Stamp' Tool\n\nThis is something I improvised. It's the 'Stamp' tool. I didn't put it in its own chapter because technically it's part of chapter 2, but moreso different.\n\nSo, I have this image of an old lady:\n\nAnd I want to put these leaves in her hair.\n\nNow, I could copy and paste all day, but there is an easy way around this.\n\nSelect the leaf, turn transparency on, and drag the leaf to wherever you want it.\n\nWhenever it's there, while it's still selected, hold shift, click once, release shift, and drag the image away.\n\n:O! It stamped! Repeat as necessary ( I rotated too. )\n\nChapter 3 - Image Scaling\n\nSo say you scanned something and the image is WAY too big and you want it smaller. How do you go about that?\n\nWell, open up paint and paste your image in. I didn't have anything massive to scan so I used this picture of a Dr Pepper.\n\nNow, say you want it smaller. You probably try to highlight it and scale it, right? It ends up looking compressed and improportioned.\n\nWell, there's an easier way. All it takes is a single keystroke!\n\nCtrl+Plus(Numpad) to make it larger or Ctrl+Minus(Numpad) to make it smaller.\n\nThis is especially useful for scaling sprites, as it keeps their pixels proportional.\n\nChapter 4 - Color Replacement\n\nSay you have drawn something with an absolutely crazy pixel border, and all of a sudden you don't like the border color.\n\nLike this box I drew.\n\nNow, I want to re-color the border yellow but I have absolutely 0 time and 0 energy. What do I do?\n\nI use the COLOR REPLACEMENT FUNCTION!\n\nSelect the eraser tool.\n\nIn the primary color box, select the color that you don't like that you want to erase. In the secondary color box, select the color you want to replace said exiled color with.\n\nThen hold right click and sweep with the eraser tool over the ugly color.\n\nIf your drawing is large, scale the eraser brush as needed.\n\nTa-da!\n\nChapter 5 - The Grid\n\nSay that you're trying to edit a piece of pixel art that you drew, and, even though you're zoomed in all the way, you're having trouble fine tuning - you're having trouble positioning the crusor where you want.\n\nThis is where the grid comes in.\n\nMSPaint comes with a built-in grid feature, accessable by hotkeys.\n\nTo view the grid, simply zoom in to either 6x or 8x, and hit Ctrl+G.\n\nChapter 6 - Other Things\n\nAnother feature of paint that is more commonly known about is the 'quick undo' feature.\n\nIt doesn't really have that much use, and, more often than not, is accidentally toggled by the user.

Instead, the larger message that comes through these newly disclosed opinions is the pervasiveness of compliance incidents, and the extent to which careful supervision by the FISA Court, while apparently able to produce some accountability in response to such incidents (as in the opinions released yesterday), simply does not seem to have mooted these concerns. That is to say, with every new FISA Court opinion responding to new compliance incidents, it becomes that much harder to trust that compliance concerns are ancient history.\n\nThroughout this process of discussing the NSA's surveillance efforts, thanks to Ed Snowden and his whistleblowing, defenders have continued to insist (1) that the NSA isn't abusing its powers and (2) that there's tremendous oversight of the NSA's activities, mainly by FISC. Yet, with this week's declassification of a second FISC ruling in which a judge detailedby the NSA, with no consequences, does anyone actually believe the NSA has stopped abusing its powers to violate everyone's privacy?As a reminder, back in September it was revealed that FISC judge Reggie Walton was pretty angry about abuses by the NSA:Then there was Judge John Bates' ruling just revealed this week:These are different violations. And, yet, in both cases, they seemed to indicate rather systematic abuses by the NSA, and very little concern on the part of the NSA to get it right. After all, these problems appeared to go on for years, and were either unreported or not clearly reported to the FISC, which could do little about it.And that raises a key question, pointed out by Steve Vladeck -- Given these two relatively recent rulings, detailing systematic, widespread and long-term abuses by the NSA in violation of the law, how can any NSA defender claim with a straight face that the NSA is now in compliance Of course, when there's no real \"cost\" for being non-compliant, why would the NSA care that much about being compliant?"}

On the face of it, even though American became the first operator of the 777-300 in America, this event would almost seem overkill if for that reason alone. After all, American began 777-200 flights back in 1999 and On January 31, 2013 American Airlines launched their first Boeing 777-300ER into service with attention that rivaled any airline's launch of a new type in recent memory. On the face of it, even though American became the first operator of the 777-300 in America, this event would almost seem overkill if for that reason alone. After all, American began 777-200 flights back in 1999 and the first 777-300 was first delivered to an airline, Cathay Pacific back in May, 1998 . The first 777-300ER entered service nearly 10 years ago with Air France. Boeing's two stretch variants of their venerable cash cow, the 777, easily have become the type's most popular versions with over 680 orders and deliveries between them out of the entire 777 program's 1,380 orders and deliveries. (as of December, 2012). In an era of smaller airliners, American inaugurated the 777-300, the largest new airliner by a U.S. carrier since the last Boeing 747-400s entered service with U.S. airliners in the late 1990s.\n\nThis inaugural, flight 963, from Dallas/Ft. Worth to S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil in the author's view is one of the most significant in the airline industry in years because it is about something much bigger than just the launch of a new airliner, it's about the re-birth of a proud American institution that happens to bear the name of our country \u2013 American Airlines.\n\nAmerican Airlines problems are well known. After becoming the world's largest airline with its 2000 acquisition of TWA, the 2000s were not kind at all to the Silver Bird. TWA and American merged during an economic downturn and by most accounts, the merger was anything but an unqualified success. American shed most of TWA's assets, routes, staff, and many of its aircraft. On September 11th, 2 of American's airliners, their crew, and passengers were forever lost in the atrocities of this horrible day. As if things couldn't get any worse, the world's airline industry hemorrhaged with the U.S. legacy carriers losing more money during this time then they had profited in their entire history. All of them declared Chapter 11, with the exception of American. Under the category of \"no good deed goes unpunished\", this decision would come back to haunt American for years. The competitors were able to re-organize, upgrade service, rebrand their images, get their costs under control, renew their fleets, expand their route structure, and finally in the case of Continental/United and Delta/Northwest consolidate into mega-carriers that dwarfed American. American was left with a barrage of serious problems: a revolving door in the executive ranks, fractious management and labor relations, dwindling market share, increasingly massive financial losses as their competitors recorded profits, devastating operational problems of which many were self-inflicted, an aging fleet, outdated and stripped down in-flight passenger service, soaring operating expenses, declining bookings, and a very unsympathetic press that at times almost seemed on a witch hunt. Like Pan Am and other failed airlines there were a few bright spots: the extremely profitable Latin American hub, the North Atlantic / London Heathrow joint-venture with British Airways, the strong and dominant hubs particularly at DFW and Miami, strength on the highly profitable trans-continental services particular JFK-LAX, and many proud employees across all positions who still believed their company could once again live up to American's 1980s advertising claim that they were \"Something Special in the Air\".\n\nBut the headwinds seemed to far outweigh the tailwinds and finally on November 29, 2011 American filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy becoming the last U.S. legacy carrier to do so. On top of that, US Airways began aggressively pursuing a merger, securing an agreement with the pilots unions. Then came the 2012 \"Summer of Discontent\" with flight cancellations and operations disruptions that sent customers into the arms of their competitors and who can forget the seats onboard a few 757s becoming unbolted during flights. It would have been understandable for the once proud Eagle to fold its wings. If the one unthinkable collapses of majors like Pan Am and Eastern occurred, could American meet the same fate?\n\nIt may be hard to remember, but since the beginning of commercial aviation: American was an innovating pace setter in the industry, and generally a profitable one at that. In many ways, American virtually wrote the history of the airline industry: American introduced the airliner that changed aviation, the Douglas DC-3. The first"}

One way was the colony of Rwanda-Urundi was taken away from Germany and made a League of Nations protectorate that was put under Belgian rule. The Belgians reinforced the class system that the Germans had imposed, further separating the Tutsies and the Hutus. The Belgians favored the Tutsies (even though they only made up 14% of Rwanda, whereas the Hutus made up 85% of the country. The Tutsies were given many privileges that the Hutu were not fortunate enough to receive, including western-style education and political power. The Belgians used the Tutsi to rule the country, having these people enforce what the Belgians believed and what the Belgians wanted done. Therefore the Tutsies were essentially puppets and the Belgians were the puppet masters. The Belgians insisted that Rwanda start to grow coffee, the corvee was introduced (this is form of labor in which each worker is whipped eight times before work each morning). The onerous corvee was not popular and many people fled to Uganda. I would have left Rwanda if I was a slave because being beaten before I started my day would make me not want to work and it would enrage me everyday. The Belgians began to focus more and more on race and they did studies that proved, in there eyes, that the Tutsies were superior. Scientists were brought into the country to measure skulls sizes (to see which group of people had a bigger skull and therefore a bigger brain-now we know that brain size is irrelevant to intelligence). Tutsies were also taller and lighter skinned so the Belgians believed they were of Caucasian decent, therefore making them \"better\" than the Hutus. Racial identification cards were also distributed which identified if the citizens of Rwanda were Hutu or Tutsi. As time went on, the idea that the Tutsies were superior to the Hutu became so ingrained in the minds of the Tutsies that they started to believe this idea and exploited their power over the Hutu. Resentment, anger, and confusion flooded the hearts and minds of the Hutu. These emotions started to build up over time and as the people entered the 1990's, these emotions were about to explode.

It's amazing how much more you can enjoy desserts when you don't need to worry about all of the carbs.\n\nIf you're looking for a last minute Christmas gift, this fudge is the perfect candidate. I'd doesn't matter if your friends or family typically eat low carb; these are a major crowd pleaser wherever I go. This recipe conveniently makes enough fudge for at least 2 gifts. I normally cut the fudge into around 30 pieces, so 15 pieces is plenty for each. If you still can't decide what gift to get, this is the way to go! Food is the way to anyone's heart, right?\n\nThis recipe doesn't use store bought Nutella. Instead, you get to make your own straight from raw hazelnuts. Don't let this intimidate you, though. It couldn't be any easier to make it at home! As long as you have a food processor and an oven, you're good to go! Be careful about using a blender for hazelnuts, though. Blenders are manufactured to perform best with liquids, so it will not get the mixture as smooth.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Harper"}

James V. Clement had won a judge's order, over objections from Marine prosecutors, for two staff attorneys to testify in open court about how senior commanders interfered in the case to get a guilty verdict.\n\nThe attorneys also were seeking to question Gen. James F. Amos, the commandant, and wanted access to his private emails.\n\nBut the criminal case ended Friday when Lt. Gen. Kenneth J. Glueck, who heads Marine Corps Combat Development Command in Quantico, Va., and was overseeing the prosecution, filed a brief court paper withdrawing the charges.\n\nJohn Dowd, Capt. Clement's principal defense counsel, accused the commandant of engineering the largest case of unlawful command influence in the Corps' history.\n\n\"The withdrawal of the charges was another act of cowardice by the commandant, his counsel and the Judge Advocate Division of [Marine Corps headquarters] to cover up the worst case of unlawful command influence in the history of the Marine Corps, which was beginning next Wednesday to be uncovered in a hearing before the chief judge \u2026 on several motions to compel discovery,\" Mr. Dowd said Saturday.\n\nThe defense attorney said he wanted to see email traffic among the commandant, his counsel and his legal division.\n\n\"That email traffic would have revealed that [the commandant] and his lawyers had engaged in a secret, corrupt effort to rig and control the investigations and dispositions of the so-called desecration cases until Capt. Clement refused to submit to a corrupt process [of being] charged with crimes he did not commit,\" Mr. Dowd said.\n\nCapt. Clement's defense counsel obtained a sworn statement from Lt. Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser who, as convening authority, was overseeing all cases in the urination incident. The general told of a one-on-one meeting in 2012 with Gen. Amos in which the commandant said he wanted Marine defendants \"crushed\" via courts-martial.\n\nGen. Waldhauser went on to become Defense Secretary's Chuck Hagel's senior military adviser.\n\nCiting that conversation, Capt. Clement's attorneys accused the commandant of blatant unlawful command influence that denied their client a fair court-martial.\n\nThey filed a motion to dismiss the charges, thus setting up a series of public pretrial hearings on Gen. Amos' conduct scheduled to begin Wednesday.\n\nCapt. Clement was charged with dereliction of duty for not properly supervising Marines who urinated on Taliban corpses.\n\nA video of the act went viral on YouTube last year, drawing harsh criticism from the White House. The captain denies any misconduct.\n\nMaj. James Weirick, a staff attorney at Quantico who was to testify Wednesday, filed a complaint with the Pentagon inspector general over Gen. Amos' actions. An investigation is underway.\n\nGen. Amos, through an aide, later told Gen. Waldhauser that he regretted his orders and decided to replace him.\n\n\"The commandant immediately realized that he had compromised the situation and took immediate action to ensure that the investigation and cases were given to an appropriate new convening authority who could exercise independent and unfettered discretion to take action in those cases,\" a Marine spokesman said this summer.\n\nThe Washington Times was not able to get a comment from the Corps.\n\nGen. Glueck's order did not explain why he was dropping the charges.\n\nHe ordered that Capt. Clement undergo an administrative board of inquiry, which will determine whether he committed misconduct.\n\nThe board can decide whether he should be retained or separated under less-than-honorable conditions.\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

He bought his first Spider-Man comic book for 20 cents at the age of four. And it wasn't long before he felt the pull to write stories of his own. \"My mother says I started writing my own comic stories when I was around five,\" Odjick said. \"But the caveat I always add is that my mother doesn't say I started writing good stories.\" Odjick has steadily improved his skills over the years. Now 39, he's the creator of \"Kagagi,\" a graphic novel that's professionally published and distributed across North America. Like many graphic novels, \"Kagagi\" includes evil villains and superhuman powers. But what makes this comic book unique is that the characters and the storyline are deeply rooted in Algonquin culture. Odjick, who is from the Kitigan Zibi Anishnabeg Algonquin First Nation in Quebec, is one of a growing number of indigenous writers and artists who are jumping into the billion-dollar comics industry. Many bring their own life experiences and cultural traditions to their stories. And critics say their work is starting to reshape the way indigenous people are portrayed in this popular medium.\n\nI thought it was really important that I create heroes that young Natives could relate to. Jon Proudstar, comic book artist\n\nIn \"Kagagi,\" Odjick's culture plays a central role from the very beginning, as the storyline springboards off of the Algonquin legend of Windigo, the story of an evil creature with the power to possess humans and turn them into cannibals. The victims become \"kind of like zombies,\" Odjick said. And the only person who can stop the Windigo? A 16-year old Anishnabe boy with superhuman strength and the ability to fly. An animated version of \"Kagagi\" currently airs on the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, a cable channel whose programming reaches about 10 million households throughout Canada. Each episode is broadcast in both English and Algonquin. In a world where many indigenous tribes struggle to maintain their language, Odjick says he is excited about the opportunity to help preserve part of his culture \"I'm not an educator,\" he says, \"but we can present language in a way that's entertaining to [kids].\"\n\nFinding new heroes\n\nAccording to Michael Sheyahshe, author of \"Native Americans In Comic Books,\" Odjick's celebration of Native culture is a long way from how Native Americans were portrayed in comics when the medium first rose to popularity. Sheyahshe, who is a member of the Caddo Nation in Oklahoma, says when comic books first began seeing major commercial success in the 1940s, Native Americans were only written as diminutive one-dimensional characters and often portrayed as a threat to white protagonists. By the 1960s and 1970s, though, Native characters began to play a more centralized role in storylines as various civil rights movements took hold throughout the United States. Sheyahshe cites Marvel's Red Wolf, a nine-issue series that featured the publishing house's first Native American superhero, as an example.\n\nCover of Jon Proudstar's \"Tribal Force\" Jon Proudstar Still, Sheyahshe says that in that time period, almost none of the Native characters were the main heroes. \"They're the helpers. They did what they were supposed to,\" he said. \"[The heroes] couldn't have gotten the job done without them, but [Native characters] didn't have series of their own.\" Sheyahshe says it has only been in recent years that he's begun to notice Native artists producing comic books starring Native characters. One of the first on the scene was Jon Proudstar's 1996 series \"Tribal Force,\" a story about five young people granted supernatural powers in order to protect their land from being destroyed by the government. Proudstar said he also takes great pride in his attention to detail. He didn't just stick with characters from his own community near Tucson, Arizona. Each of his characters comes from a different tribe, and he spent a lot of time making sure their cultures were accurately and respectfully depicted. \"I knew very little about the Hunkpapa Sioux,\" he says, \"So I went to a couple of people who are Hunkpapa and asked them about their communities, what's important to them.\" His White Calf Buffalo Woman is one result of this research. After Proudstar learned that depictions of the White Calf Buffalo Woman are among the culture's most sacred images, he adapted her character to appear in the book as only a silhouette. Proudstar said seeing Native American stereotypes and inaccuracies continue to show up in comic books was a big motivation for his work. But Proudstar also wanted to create a universe in which heroes face the same challenges that many Native kids face today, like living with the effects of fetal alcohol syndrome and child molestation,"}

The District 9 and Elysium director released a trailer for some of the studio's upcoming projects, which will be released to Steam in the next couple of months.\n\nThe trailer opens with a shot of an overgrown Eiffel Tower, as a voiceover explains that aliens have come to exterminate humanity. The trailer then shows off quite a bit more: a woman shooting an alien in a red-lit corridor, American soldiers flying over Vietnam, trucks flying Texas flags driving through the desert, a whole bunch of cool-looking aliens and quite a bit more. The trailer explains that what's coming soon is a series of short, experimental films called Oats: Volume 1.\n\nBlomkamp has been teasing hints about Oats Studios for the last year, asking if fans would be interested in buying films off of Steam, and posted some intriguing images to Twitter, showing off one of the aliens seen in the trailer, as well as a Vietnam-era soldier. Earlier this month, he showed off a 15 second teaser showing off a soldier shooting down... something.\n\nIf I sold experimental short films on @steam_games as tests for potential full feature films, would people watch them? \u2014 N\u039eill Blomkamp (@NeillBlomkamp) April 9, 2017\n\nWhile Blomkamp earned considerable acclaim for his debut feature District 9, he got his start with short films, such as Alive in Joburg (which became District 9), Landfall, a short Halo film (his debut film was originally supposed to be an adaptation of the Bungie franchise), and more recently, an entry in BMW's The Hire series, featuring Clive Owen. From the looks of it, these upcoming short films will be a set of really exciting science fiction films.\n\nThe trailer simply says that Oats: Volume 1 will be streaming soon.

She suggests that \"even someone who is mentally ill and has been convicted of domestic violence can still obtain a firearm due to various background-check loopholes.\" To be fair, this is not true. Individuals who are involuntarily committed for mental illness treatment are barred from buying guns\u2013involuntarily commitment is a threshold that must be crossed. But the judge who handled John Russell Houser's mental oversight\u2013 Carroll County Probate Judge Betty Cason\u2013said she never ordered him involuntarily committed.\n\nSo, there already is a mechanism for keeping the mentally ill from obtaining guns, but they have to meet a certain threshold before being barred from gun purchases.\n\nInstead of admitting this, Schumer just mocks the system. She points to blind people and people on the terror watch list buying guns, then says, \"\"I'm all about equal rights for the disabled, but if Stevie Wonder calls me and he's like, 'Do you want to go shooting today?' I'm going to be like, 'Hard pass!'\" Schumer does not mention the fact that neither the terror attack in San Bernadino (December 2, 2015) nor Orlando (June 12, 2o16) would have been stopped by adding the terror watch list to background checks because none of the attackers in either case were on the list.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

{"id": 400, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "You may have heard that Ubisoft have a new Tom Clancy game coming out this year called The Division. If you've played literally any other Tom Clancy game before, you probably have a pretty good idea on what The Division is like.\n\nWait, no. That's not right at all. The Division is unlike any Tom Clancy game you've played before. That's because it's a big open-world RPG. Yeah, like those games with dragons, but this time it's bio-terrorism instead. That may sound strange, but The Division is actually really good at being a role-playing game.\n\nHere's ten reasons why The Division is the next big thing in PC RPGs.\n\n1 \u2013 It's genuinely an RPG\n\nLet's get one thing straight: The Division is an RPG. And I don't mean it's a third-person shooter with some upgrade stats: this is a full-out, numbers-led RPG to stand in the stables next to Diablo III and Borderlands. Both you and enemies have hit points, you can increase your weapon DPS by bolting on mods, and you level up by gaining XP for kills and quest completion. It's even got a character creator. The only way it could be any more RPG is if Chris Avellone was writing it.\n\n\"From the beginning when we set out to do an RPG,\" explains creative director Magnus Jans\u00e9n. \"We wanted to do something where your investment and your tactics matter.\"\n\nBecause it's an RPG, The Division's combat is nothing like the one-hit-kill firefights of other Tom Clancy games. \"To honour your [weapon and skill] choices, and doing tactical combat in the RPG setting, we've made some concessions to the absolute reality,\" says Jans\u00e9n. As such, enemies must be fired upon until their HP depletes, rather than simply double-tapped in the head.\n\n\"We keep you immersed with the fact that enemies have body armour and various things to explain why some people take a lot more damage than others,\" explains Jans\u00e9n in regards to the more bullet sponge-y enemies.\n\n2 \u2013 It's not competing with the MMO crowd\n\nMMO's have their definition in the title: massive, multiplayer, and online. While The Division is online and multiplayer, it's certainly not massive in terms of players. In the questing zones of its Midtown Manhattan, you'll be with just three other co-op players at most. Head into the Dark Zone \u2013 the highly contaminated PvP area at the centre of the map \u2013 and things get busier, but not by much.\n\n\"It's not a crowded place,\" reveals Jans\u00e9n. \"We want to keep encounters something interesting, so the Dark Zone is not crowded.\"\n\nThe technical numbers behind the Dark Zone is support for about 20 \u2013 24 players, but you'll likely never see that many all in one area. \"There are lots and lots of square miles, so we tried to fill that up with people to reach a certain density,\" says Jans\u00e9n. \"You'll walk a couple of blocks and you're likely to maybe see one person. If you make a lot of noise, like during an extraction, then you're likely to attract a handful of people, maybe one or two groups.\"\n\nBasically, your immersion in the world won't be ruined by a server of 200 people teabagging corpses.\n\n3 \u2013 It's proper Tom Clancy\n\nDid you know that The Division is real? Well, sort of. It's based on Operation Dark Winter, a simulation carried out in 2001 by the American government to see how well the country would cope with a smallpox epidemic. The answer was pretty simple: we're doomed. Society and infrastructure would collapse, leading to disaster in the streets.\n\nThat's scary for us in real life, but it's the perfect start to a Tom Clancy novel. Since Tom himself is no longer with us, it's left to Ubisoft to tell the tale. For The Division, the epidemic all starts on Black Friday, with the virus being passed around on banknotes. Get it? It's the downfall of capitalism thanks to rampant consumerism. Clever, eh?\n\nSaving us all from anarchy are the agents of The Division themselves: men and women with access to tons and tons of military hardware, ready to shoot the heck out of those who would try and destroy America by looting the abandoned buildings of New York. Yup, this is a Clancy story alright.\n\n4 \u2013 It's an open world that feels real\n\nIt's mandatory to have an open world in RPGs these days, and The Division certainly has one. It's a close-enough 1:1 recreation of Midtown Manhattan, complete with major spots like Madison Square Garden, Times Square, and the Lincoln Tunnel. Because of the strive for accuracy, you won't find a single copy-paste street corner in The Division. And thanks to being a"}

Some large technology groups have also gone public with dual-class share structures that limit shareholder rights in an effort to minimise the influence of activist hedge funds.\n\nThe asset management bosses, including Abby Johnson of Fidelity, Larry Fink of BlackRock and Tim Armour of Capital Group, met most recently at JPMorgan's New York headquarters in December, the Financial Times has learnt, following a first meeting in August.\n\nThe group is discussing a statement of best practice on corporate governance. Discussions have focused on issues such as the role of board directors, executive compensation, board tenure and shareholder rights, all of which have been flashpoints at US annual meetings.\n\nMr Dimon, in particular, has reason to hope for a rapprochement between boards and long-term shareholders. He has faced personal criticism for combining the role of chairman and chief executive at JPMorgan, and at the company's last two annual meetings, more than a third of its shareholders voted that he should split the roles.\n\nAs well as being a major player in capital markets, JPMorgan also has an asset management arm that is one of the US equity market's largest investors, with $1.7tn in assets. Mr Buffett, a long-time friend of Mr Dimon, has eschewed many corporate governance norms at his company, Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nOther contributors to the initiative are understood to include Mark Wiseman of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Jeff Ubben of ValueAct, an activist hedge fund manager.\n\nPodcast Alphachat: How short-termism is misunderstood Credit Suisse's Michael Mauboussin discusses corporate short-termism with host Cardiff Garcia\n\nNo participants agreed to be quoted on the initiative, which is not expected to come to fruition for several months. The asset managers hope to come up with a list of best practices that they will support at the companies they invest in.\n\nThe move comes amid a debate on shareholder rights and responsibilities and on the balance of power between investors, boards and management. Activist hedge funds with more than $100bn in assets have used their muscle to demand board changes and push companies to increase returns to shareholders, often through share buybacks.\n\nThe largest companies typically face a half-dozen or more votes from dissident shareholders at each annual meeting, on topics ranging from executive compensation to environmental policies and political lobbying.\n\nAn increasing number of US companies have also agreed this year to offer long-term shareholders the right to nominate their own candidates for board directors.\n\nThe volume of initial public offerings tumbled 42 per cent in the US last year despite the growing economy, as companies sought investors \u2014 including some traditional public markets investors \u2014 who were willing to buy shares even while they remained private.\n\nLetter in response to this report:\n\nBoards fail when executives are captured / From Bevis Longstreth"}

This is useful, for example, if you have a mouseover event and an image needs to change without any delay.\n\nOption 1: Nice and Simple\n\nTo preload an image into your web page, paste the code below into the document head (replace the red image file name with your own):\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> if (document.images) { img1 = new Image(); img1.src = \" image.jpg \"; } </script>\n\nYou can add more images by duplicating the image lines, e.g.:\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> if (document.images) { img1 = new Image(); img1.src = \" image.jpg \"; img2 = new Image(); img2.src = \" image2.jpg \"; } </script>\n\nOption 2: A Flexible Array\n\nThis method can be used if you have an external JavaScript file that is used by multiple pages. Use the same function to easily preload any number of images on different pages. Firstly, add the following function to your main JavaScript file:\n\nfunction preload(images) { if (document.images) { var i = 0; var imageArray = new Array(); imageArray = images.split(','); var imageObj = new Image(); for(i=0; i<=imageArray.length-1; i++) { //document.write('<img src=\"' + imageArray[i] + '\" />');// Write to page (uncomment to check images) imageObj.src=imageArray[i]; } } }\n\nThen in the <head> of each web page, add the following code after you've called the main JavaScript file:\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> preload(' image1.jpg , image2.jpg , image3.jpg '); </script>\n\nReplace the file names in red with your own files. You can have as many as you like, just make sure that they are separated by a comma.\n\nOption 3: No JavaScript\n\nYou can also preload an image without JavaScript by creating a 1 pixel square version of the file and hiding it somewhere on the page, like so:\n\n<image src=\"picture.jpg\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\">"}

I have the asset sheet, but don't know how to quit my job and convert my net worth into income I can live on.\n\nProblem #2: What comes next? I have absolutely no idea what to do with the next phase of my life. I just know I don't want to be in my industry anymore. It isn't that I hate it. I don't. It's just that it no longer provides significant challenges or pleasure. I'm suddenly unsure if it ever did. My role is mostly mechanical: I go through the motions. I'm an expert. I receive work and I do it and I don't think twice about whether or not I'm enjoying it. It just happens \u2013 it's part of me. How do I get rid of this?\n\nProblem #3: What happens to my previous life? What will I tell people? Will I lose friends? What will I do with the loss of structure?\n\nProblem #4: What will I do to make me feel like I'm giving back? I don't think that what I currently do is all that important, but at the very least, I perform my function well and folks are happy with my contributions. This gives me some small sense of value and esteem. What will replace this?\n\nProblem #5: Purposelessness at work. Although I produce some amount of valuable work for my employer every week, most of the hours are spent idling. I'm stuck there, cannot leave, cannot work-from-home, and cannot stand this aspect of the job now that I'm FI. It was tolerable in the past, when I had a slow stint at a previous employer, but that's because I still really needed the salary, which filled me with a sense of purpose and made the idleness seem like a useful activity by the fact that it was driving me toward completion of a long-standing goal.\n\nProblem #6: The Bucket of Fear. I have all sorts of concerns about moving from FI to RE status, most of which I articulated in this post. At the time of these issues, back in 2013, the biggest one was the idea that I'd do nothing \u2014 absolutely nothing \u2014 after retiring. Maybe I'd become like Peggy Bundy on Married\u2026 With Children, watching soap operas during the day and eating bon-bons. Or, worse, I'd return to my old drinking problem.\n\nProblem #7: I Feel Older. With age, most people feel a decreased sense of possibility in life. Fewer paths are available to follow. Many of your choices have already been made. You have launched. There is no returning to Earth for another unique blastoff in a totally different direction; your primary trajectory has been defined, for better or worse. This isn't to say that there aren't plenty of paths still open to you, but the fact remains that some are closed. For example, you will not, at age 35, become an Olympic-calibre swimmer. (You could, however, still become a good one.)\n\nProblem #8: My Significant Other is Not Totally Cool With All Of This. Enough said.\n\nI added that some of these problems I think about frequently \u2014 like the finances, and feeling purposeless \u2014 while others I do my best to ignore. After I dumped all of this stuff on him, Dr. Katz told me to start working on logistics first.\n\nMy suggestion? Tackle the finances immediately. It'll be the easiest to resolve because it's strictly a numbers game and it'll be good to cross something quickly off your list. You think you have enough to retire? Well, you don't have to prove it to me. You have to prove it to yourself. Break things down and get comfortable with your own plans. Only you can assert that you're fully covered on this.\n\nDo the research that needs to be done. Crunch numbers. Create spreadsheets. Find Jesus. Whatever it takes.\n\nHe also immediately commented on #4, Giving back, telling me that this is all in my head. I don't have to give back to anyone, ever. I know, it's just one man's opinion, but he was very clear and passionate on this point. I wondered briefly if he was a Libertarian.\n\nAnd to be honest, this completely shocked me. The last thing I expected was for a goddamned therapist to tell me something is quote all in my head. I thought these people (read: analysts) were, as a rule, paid to indulge their clients \u2014 to say precisely the opposite. Something along the lines of: Oh, well you think that way because of your upbringing. But let's examine the substrate of these mental patterns: Tell me about your mother.\n\nStill, his point was clear: I needed to stop worrying about the expectations of others, the"}

That's right, the bouncing, rubbery, ice skate with wheels is back. But don't groan just yet. BioWare has been doing some interesting work to make sure that the Mako is more universally liked this time around - and that involves getting a little help from a team that knows its stuff about racers.\n\n\nBoth Mac Walters (Creative Director on Mass Effect: Andromeda) and Aaron Flynn (general manager at BioWare) were very forthcoming that the Mako wasn't just awkward to drive, but that you couldn't do a lot of interesting stuff with it. \"So that's all going to get fixed,\" Flynn tells me. \"When we thought about bringing the Mako back, we said: 'We can't bring the Mako back as an iteration of the Mako. It has to be a high quality experience that compares well to any driving simulation by doing that.'\"\n\nSo what do you do when you need to overhaul your vehicles, and you're part of a huge corporation with teams working on multiple different kinds of projects? You bring on the Need for Speed team to help out. \"One really fortuitous thing is that, because so many other teams are on Frostbite now, the Need for Speed folks had done a couple of games on Frostbite at that point,\" Flynn explains. \"They were more than happy to lend a hand and offer advice and guidance to our developers to make sure that the Mako, when we actually get it all done, drives and plays great. It doesn't feel like you have those many, many edge cases the Mako in [the first Mass Effect] had where you could do crazy stuff with it. So that won't be there, knock on wood.\"\n\n\nMaking the Mako control well, and making it take advantage of the newer open spaces all goes back to a single point: that the team wants to make the Mako actually fun to play. \"I think we've approached pretty much everything with Mass Effect: Andromeda that we shouldn't have assumptions about the way we've done things in the past,\" Walters tells me. \"Some things have worked very well, other things haven't, so we looked at the Mako, we said 'Is it fun?' That had to be the question we wanted to answer first. And then, 'is it serving the purpose of exploration that we wanted it to?'

These types of motions utilize muscles in your back like: the latissimus, rhomboids, middle and lower trapezius. These muscles often play a role in good posture, they keep your shoulders back and your spine upright. So, how might climbing be making your posture worse?\n\nIt is the simple resting posture on the wall. Climbers do this naturally to be more efficient in their muscle use. Do you tend to rest; how often and for how long on each climb? Most climbers will tell you to take rest brakes on the wall and let everything \"hang loose\" and relax the muscles in your back and even in your arms. This is done to use your body in the most efficient way and expend the least amount of energy. This is where the problem lies because normal resting posture puts your spine in a position called kyphosis.There is a natural kyphosis in your mid back but we are putting that to the extreme when we climb. Our normal population and especially the younger generations are already increasing this kyphosis with electronics use and regular sitting/standing posture. So, for us climbers, we need to prevent our physical activities from increase this kyphosis even further!\n\nWhy is this bad? A limitation in the thoracic spine, or mid back, can often lead to back pain, shoulder pain, and neck pain. When one segment in the body is limited it affects everything else above and below that segment.\n\nWhat can you do to change this?\n\nThe answer is simple! You need to work on extension in the mid back as well as opening the front of your body. Then train the muscles in your chest to equalize your strength ratio from front to back. Below are some examples of exercises and soft tissue releases that can help protect your back, neck, and shoulders to keep you reaching new heights!\n\nScorpion\n\nFoam Roller in extension\n\nLacrosse ball pec release\n\nPush-up / bench press\n\nFront plank / side plank\n\nIf you have any questions about strength training and form when it comes to rock climbing please feel free to contact me at bwally@mainephysicaltherapy.com.

The smuggling network was not identified.\n\nArmy Col. Lisa A. Garcia, a Southcom spokeswoman, did not address the intelligence report directly but said Sunni terrorist infiltration is a security concern.\n\n\"Networks that specialize in smuggling individuals from regions of terrorist concern, mainly from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, the Middle East, and East Africa, are indeed a concern for Southcom and other interagency security partners who support our country's national security,\" Garcia told the Washington Free Beacon.\n\n\"There are major hubs that serve as entry points into the region for migrants from those areas of concern attempting to enter the U.S. along our border with Mexico,\" she said.\n\nThe infiltrators from terrorist states and unstable regions exploit vulnerabilities in commercial transportation systems and immigration enforcement agencies in some of the countries used for transit, Garcia said.\n\n\"In 2015, we saw a total of 331,000 migrants enter the southwestern border between the U.S. and Mexico, of that we estimate more than 30,000 of those were from countries of terrorist concern,\" she said.\n\nAnother problem in dealing with migrants from the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia is a lack of information among the governments of the countries used by potential terrorists for transit.\n\nThe exploitation of alien smuggling networks by terrorists until recently had been dismissed by both American security officials and private security experts as largely an urban myth.\n\nHowever, the Southcom intelligence report revealed that the threat of Islamist terror infiltration is no longer theoretical. \"This makes the case for Trump's wall,\" said one American security official of the Southcom report. \"These guys are doing whatever they want to get in the country.\"\n\nAdm. Kurt Tidd, Southcom's commander, said last week that the lack of information is hampering security efforts against alien smuggling.\n\n\"An element that has been long recognized is that our ability to track people moving through transportation systems is an area that we must continue to devote efforts on, and the ease with which human traffickers are able to use our transportation systems to move people through the networks relatively undetected should give us all concern,\" Tidd said.\n\nSpecial interest aliens are described by the U.S. government as aliens who pose a potential terrorism threat coming from 34 nations in the Middle East, Africa, Southwest Asia, Central Asia, and East Asia. The list of states of concern includes Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Eritrea, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Malaysia.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump last week called for stepped up counterterrorism measures that he said would involve \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants in a bid to better screen out potential terrorists.\n\nTrump also has made a campaign theme the construction of a wall across the United States' southern border as part of efforts to better control the flood of illegal immigrants.\n\nJoel Vargas, head of Contingent Security Services and a consultant to law enforcement agencies, said there is no evidence Sunni extremists are creating new relationships with alien smugglers. However, he said in an email that \"existing smuggling networks from Central America are increasing their access.\"\n\n\"We have intercepted immigrants coming from Asia but we have been unable to determine if they are extremists,\" Vargas said. \"Our Sunni illegal migration coming from [Latin America] is very small. On the other hand, they can use the networks set up by the Shia.\"\n\nA report produced by Vargas for the International Airport, Seaport and Transport Police states that the Iran-backed Shiite terror group Hezbollah mainly has ties to Latin American through overseas Lebanese expatriates.\n\nHezbollah recently increased support in transnational crime in the region by supply arms and training to various groups.\n\n\"Hezbollah's current goals appear to be focused on accruing resources rather than conducting offensive operations, however the group's growing capabilities are still a clear threat to regional U.S. interests,\" the report said. \"Iran's involvement in Latin America is also increasing, and Hezbollah will likely be able to use these budding political and economic ties as cover for its operations.\"\n\nVargas said Hezbollah's networks in Latin America could be used by Sunni extremists to get to the United States. \"That is a workable situation,\" he said. \"If they disclose they are ISIL or any other group, I doubt that even the Shias will help out. Even [drug] cartels are killing anyone who appears extremist. It is bad for their business.\"\n\nAccording to Vargas, Guatemala remains a weak link"}

She wouldn't even listen to what I had to say!\n\nShe just kept saying all this shit about how I can't afford it \u2013 even though I have tens of thousands of euros sitting in a bank account waiting for me!

The three of them cornered me after dinner last night and asked me what happened\u2026 They could tell there was something weird going on. So I told them about it (minus the part where I called their mom a bitch\u2026 Something told me that wouldn't be the best idea).\n\nTony got all nervous and started spewing all the same garbage Tante Joce was saying about why moving out's a bad idea and how Tante Joce is just worried about me and blah blah blah.

{"id": 415, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "[soliloquy id=\"18443\u2033]\n\nWyrmwood is a movie about the zombie apocalypse (as many movies are these days). It follows two main plot threads. First off, we have Barry (Jay Gallagher) who teams up with various travelers trying to survive in this new world. All the while Barry feels profound remorse and guilt over having had to put a few nails in the heads of his newly-undead wife and child. The story goes in a very Mad Max\u2013esque direction and that os what immediately drew me into this picture. The cast gears up in sporting equipment and makeshift armor and piles into a modded out truck that uses zombies as its' fuel source (just go with it).\n\nWhile this is all going on, Barry's sister Brooke (Bianca Bradey) has been captured by some kind of military experiment involving zombies and a crazy scientist in a hazmat suit. As she is chained to a wall she slowly begins to develop the ability to control zombies through some sort of telepathy or telekinesis or something (again, just go with it).\n\nHere is where I take a bit of an issue. This movie seems like it's at odds with itself and confused as to what it wants to be. It feels like screenwriters Kiah Roache-Turner and Tristan Roache-Turner had two ideas for a zombie movie and instead of choosing one and running with it they tried to do both at the same time. Either story is interesting enough to carry the film, but I wish they had picked one or the other, because both of them are underdeveloped. Characters in Barry's story often get killed off before we learn anything about them and a lot of the details of the zombie fuel thing are left unexplained. Why did all of the regular gas stop working? Why are the zombies suddenly breathing and bleeding fuel? It's the same way with Brooke's story. There are vague allusions to a higher purpose, but we never really know what the military experiment was meant to accomplish. The plot raises too many questions to which we never get answers.\n\nScript issues aside, the core cast of Wyrmwood is great. Jay Gallagher steals the show as Barry, going to some real extremes over the course of the movie. He's a blast to watch as guilt turns to anger and he starts to take out his frustrations on the unsuspecting zombie population. Seriously, there are moments where he just runs right up to them and punches them in the face. Having started the movie off in a very dark place it's great to see him just let loose. Leon Bruchill's Benny plays off of Barry really well and they have some nice banter at times. Bianca Bradley as Brooke is tough as nails even before the zombie superpowers kick in. She's badass and always engaging to watch, which is impressive considering how much of the movie she spends with a muzzle on her face while she's tied to a wall.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention Berryn Schwerdt as the doctor. I have no idea what his character was doing but oh man is he entertaining. This doctor is dancing to music while sticking syringes in zombies and chewing up the scenery all over his laboratory. He's an over-the-top caricature, but it really works.\n\nKiah Roache-Turner shows some real promise in the director's chair as well. Wyrmwood can be a little rough around the edges at times, but for the most part it's a really good looking movie. There's some of the dreaded \"shaky cam,\" but it's never done to an obnoxious degree and always serves to accent the chaos of the situation. There's definitely an eye for color here, too. Some scenes are lit in a saturated and exaggerated way while others are void of color entirely. All of this sets an interesting mood throughout the picture.\n\nUltimately, I liked this movie. It's definitely in that \"style over substance\" camp, but sometimes that's enough. The script is all over the place throwing everything but the kitchen sink at you, and while that can be a little off-putting in certain regards it also makes for a hell of an experience. If they had ironed out some of the plot issues this could have been a great movie, but as it stands it's a good one. Wyrmwood is a fun and humorous adventure that doesn't take itself incredibly seriously but still manages to squeeze in some really dark and emotional moments. It's left open for a sequel so who knows\u2026 maybe we'll get the answers to those questions some day.

(M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res via AP)\n\nAfter nearly an hour of bombing on its hospital in the Afghan city of Kunduz, a Doctors Without Borders representative in Kabul received a text message from a U.S. military official in response to the group's pleas to stop the attack: \"I'll do my best,\" said the text message from the American, who was also in Kabul. \"Praying for you all.\"\n\nThe 2:59 a.m. message is included in a log released by Doctors Without Borders on Thursday in a report on the Oct. 3 bombing of its Kunduz medical facility by the U.S. military. The first bombs from a U.S. AC-130 gunship fell between 2 a.m. and 2:08 a.m., prompting a flurry of calls from the medical organization, also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res Global (MSF), for the airstrikes to stop.\n\n[Pentagon faces question: Should it make condolence payments for Taliban killed in hospital bombing?]\n\nThe report was released by MSF to be transparent and counter speculation that the hospital was being used as a Taliban military base, the medical organization said. The hospital was treating Afghan civilians, Taliban fighters and civilians the night of the airstrikes, it said.\n\nThe bombing came as the U.S. and Afghan militaries fought to take back the city of Kunduz, which had fallen to the Taliban a few days before. Some 30 medical staff members and patients were killed, with some burned beyond recognition.\n\n\"The question remains as to whether our hospital lost protected status in the eyes of the military forces engaged in this attack \u2014 and if so, why,\" said Joanne Liu, MSF's international president, in a letter included with the report. \"This answer does not lie within the MSF hospital. Those responsible for requesting, ordering and approving the airstrikes hold these answers.\"\n\nA Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, said Thursday that MSF shared its report with the military ahead of releasing it. Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, also met with MSF leaders in Afghanistan on Wednesday, Davis added.\n\n\"We continue to work closely with MSF in identifying the victims killed and wounded so we can conclude our investigations and proceed with follow-on actions, to include condolence payments. We're also committed to working with MSF to determine the full extent of the damage on the hospital so that it can be repaired in full.\"\n\nMSF began making calls about the airstrikes, which remain under investigation by the U.S. military, no more than 11 minutes after the first airstrikes hit the hospital, the report said. At 2:19 a.m., an MSF official called the top U.S. military headquarters in Afghanistan to say that the hospital had been hit with an airstrike, but the bombs continued to fall.\n\n[In northern Afghanistan, a mix of Taliban, foreign fighters and soldiers spread thin]\n\nMSF followed up with a 2:20 a.m. phone call to the International Committee of the Red Cross, and calls at 2:32 a.m. to a Defense Department official in Washington and a United Nations liaison in Afghanistan, the report said. As the airstrikes continued, a military official at the U.S. military headquarters in Kabul apologized in a text message at 2:52 a.m.\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that, I still do not know what happened,\" the text message said, according to the MSF report.\n\nThe message exchange as it appears in the report follows. Resolute Support is shorthand for the headquarters by the same name, which leads U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and is near the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. OCHA CivMil is short for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs' civil-military liaison in Afghanistan.\n\n\nThe humanitarian group assured the U.S. military its hospital in northern Afghanistan was not under Taliban threat just days before a deadly airstrike on the compound last month, the organization said Thursday.\n\nThe group continued to push for an independent investigation into one of the deadliest civilian casualty incidents stemming from a coalition action in the Afghan conflict. The U.S. military and others are currently conducting parallel reviews into the chain of events leading to the more than hour-long attack.\n\nCampbell told The Washington Post in an interview in Kabul on Friday that the military is obligated by law to do what is known in military parlance as a 15-6 investigation, after the Army regulation that lays out the rules for investigating officers.

However, just 18 months ago, McCain himself traveled to Tripoli to talk to Gadhafi about a transfer of American military equipment. He also praised the \"remarkable and positive turn\" in U.S.-Libya relations.\n\nIt turns out one of the diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks describes in detail the friendly meeting between McCain and Gadhafi. It was also attended by fellow hawks Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham as well as Gadhafi's son, Muatassim. (See video of the meeting here.)\n\nKeep in mind the context for the meeting was several years of increasingly warm relations between the U.S. and Libya. In the private talks, Muatassim Gadhafi \"emphasized Libya's interest in the purchase of U.S. lethal and non-lethal military equipment.\" McCain was receptive to that request:\n\nMuatassim requested the \"highest level of help possible\" to obtain military supplies, including mobile hospitals and uniforms. He also requested assistance with upgrading Libya's equipment, including helicopters. \"We can get [equipment] from Russia or China, but we want to get it from you as a symbol of faith from the United States,\" he said. He described the security threats that Libya could possibly face as a result of its geography - \"There are 60 million Algerians to the West, 80 million Egyptians to the East, we have Europe in front of us, and we face Sub-Saharan Africa with its problems to the South.\" ... Senator McCain assured Muatassim that the United States wanted to provide Libya with the equipment it needs for its TRIPOLI 00000677 002.2 OF 002 security. He stated that he understood Libya's requests regarding the rehabilitation of its eight C130s (ref D) and pledged to see what he could do to move things forward in Congress. He encouraged Muatassim to keep in mind the long-term perspective of bilateral security engagement and to remember that small obstacles will emerge from time to time that can be overcome.\n\nBucky Turco at Animal New York points out that the Pentagon apparently has an expansive definition of \"non-lethal equipment.\" The term encompasses items like shotguns, tear gas canisters and stun grenades.\n\nMcCain sent out this memorable tweet after his Gadhafi meeting:\n\nThere's nothing contradictory about previously advocating for normalization of relations with Gadhafi and then shifting, in the face of Gadhafi's attacks on rebels, to supporting a bombing campaign. That's not what McCain is doing. He is arguing that Ghadafi needs to be ousted because he has American blood on his hands (from 1988), when the senator himself was meeting with and praising the Libyan regime a mere 18 months ago."}

Verily, the most honored of you in the sight of God is the one who is most righteous} (49:13)\n\nSo I am honored. But it is not by my relationship to men. My value as a woman is not measured by the size of my waist or the number of men who like me. My worth as a human being is measured on a higher scale: a scale of righteousness and piety. And my purpose in life\u2014despite what the fashion magazines say\u2014is something more sublime than just looking good for men.\n\nAnd so God tells me to cover myself, to hide my beauty, and to tell the world that I'm not here to please men with my body; I'm here to please God.

My worth is defined by the beauty of my soul, my heart, my moral character. So I won't worship your beauty standards, and I don't submit to your fashion sense. My submission is to something higher.\n\nWith my veil I put my faith on display\u2014rather than my beauty. My value as a human is defined by my relationship with God, not by my looks. So I cover the irrelevant. And when you look at me, you don't see a body. You view me only for what I am: a servant of my Creator.\n\nSo you see, as a Muslim woman, I've been liberated from a silent kind of bondage. I don't answer to the slaves of God on earth.

{"id": 421, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Due to the fierce competition in the online shopping world, one of the common questions we're asked by clients, is how they can keep control of product pricing. After all, when you sell to a distributor or to a retailer you're selling at a discounted rate. The price resellers pay is determined mostly by your MSRP (Manufacturer Suggest Retail Price). But once they've paid, they can then sell at whatever price they deem profitable to them. So if your MSRP is $50.00 and you sell to a retailer at 50% discount, they have the potential to make $25.00 profit. But if they're willing to make less they can undercut the competition.\n\nWhen this happens, and the price war kicks in, your MSRP goes out the window and your phone starts to ring off the hook with complaints from resellers. Usually it's the brick and mortar stores complaining about the cutthroat pricing the online players are offering. But it can be other online resellers complaining too.\n\nThe solution (or rather prevention) is MAP\n\nWhen we're working with new companies and we're discussing pricing strategy and sales channels - we always bring up their reseller agreements. It can be a dicey conversation, since many eager entrepreneurs will take any order, and don't want to potentially complicate sales with legal agreements. However, the smartest will listen and can understand how implementing reseller agreements from the start will circumvent problems (such as price wars and reseller disputes) later.\n\nReseller agreements can be complicated things and its definitely a document you'll need legal counsel to do right. But virtually all of them should stipulate that the reseller agrees to a minimum advertised price.\n\nSo what exactly is MAP?\n\nA minimum advertised price is just that - it's the agreed price a reseller agrees to advertise a brand or product at. There may be some wiggle room, but generally, when a reseller accepts the agreement, they're stuck. They can't advertise a product for sale any less than the agreed price. This means in print, online, or any where. Of course, this doesn't mean they can't sell the product cheaper, they simply can't display a cheaper price. And well, if the lower price isn't shown, it's hard to discover it.\n\nMAP does not equal price fixing\n\nWhile collusion to maintain a fixed price or profit margin is illegal in most circumstances MAP policies are legitimate and valid - if done correctly. First, and here's the big differentiator - MAP pricing does not limit the actual selling price. It simply sets the minimum price a product can be advertised at - whether that's in print or online.\n\nApple computer is a perfect example of this policy. It's rare that you'll see any sale or larger discounting on Apple products - regardless of the size of the reseller. Apple controls their displayed pricing in two ways. First, their reseller agreements certainly dictate MAP price points - and secondly, they offer slimmer than normal margins to their channels - the later reduces the incentive to discount heavily. They also strictly control the inventory levels dolled out to resellers - to prevent steep discounting or clearance pricing. In fact, one of the few times you'll ever see bargain pricing on Apple products is when a retailer has decided to discontinue selling Apple. But because they're usually not sitting on a large stock pile of inventory, this rarely happens.\n\nWhy would a reseller accept MAP?\n\nResellers are adverse to risk. They certainly don't want to take on new brands and products that they'll be undercut on by other resellers. They want to have some cost control and profit assurances. MAP affords them some protection. They know that if they buy your product to sell, they won't necessarily see it online tomorrow advertised for way less. Likewise, generally, by accepting MAP the reseller will gain something in return. And this is the important motivator. It may be co-op advertising dollars. It may be exclusivity or specific territories. Or it could simply be better wholesale pricing.\n\nWhat about eBay and Amazon?\n\nOf course, the \"right of first sale doctrine\" and the abundance of steep discount offers means you'll always find \"deals\" online. Steeply discounted products that don't adhere to your MAP - and probably don't have to. For instance, if you or a reseller, offer a promotional discount, perhaps buy one get one free (BOGO) - you'll get savvy shoppers that scoop up these deals and then resell the products at a discount. And since they're working with virtually no overhead, they may be willing to live on a few dollars of profit.\n\nOur advice to clients in this area is usually two-fold. First, limit or at least monitor these types of sales and promotional offers. If you make such an offer and a customer suddenly orders dozens of them, there's a good chance they'll be on eBay in the"}

That's 286,000 more than the comparable time a year ago.\n\nThe number of people opting for Obamacare is under more scrutiny than usual this year, since President-elect Trump and Congressional Republicans have vowed to repeal it soon after he takes office on Jan. 20. Initial efforts, however, are already running into resistance, with some GOP members wanting to wait until a replacement plan is ready before voting to repeal.\n\nThough the Trump administration takes control late next week, current Health & Human Services officials laid out a plan to further boost sign ups through Jan. 31, which marks the end of open enrollment. The agency is airing television and radio ads, sending targeted emails to potential customers and reaching out via YouTube and other social media channels -- continuing outreach efforts that have been underway during this enrollment season.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service is also contacting those who paid a penalty for remaining uninsured. The agency recently announced that about 6.5 million Americans had to pay the penalty, typically $330, in 2015. That's less than the roughly 8 million who were penalized in 2014.\n\nHigh on the list of targets is younger Americans, who typically are healthier and have lower health care expenses. However, they still make up only 26% of those signing up on the federal exchange to date, the same as last year.\n\nIt's unclear whether the marketing efforts will continue under Trump, who has vowed to repeal President Obama's signature health reform law.\n\nStill, Obama and his officials continue to make a case for Obamacare.\n\n\"In access, quality and affordability, the Affordable Care Act has helped us make real progress for families across the nation,\" said Health Secretary Sylvia Burwell on Monday.\n\nThe Obama administration expects a total of 13.8 million people to sign up for plans by the end of the enrollment period, which began Nov. 1. However, it's common for people to drop their policies during the course of the year because they find coverage elsewhere, either through a job or a spouse. So, an average of 11.4 million people are expected to be in Obamacare policies during 2017.\n\nConsumers aren't officially enrolled until they pay their first month's premium.\n\nRelated: GOP worried about Obamacare plan\n\nEven before the election, there were concerns that prospective enrollees would be deterred by price hikes -- the average premium for the benchmark silver plan soared 22% for 2017 -- and the fact that some insurers had pulled out of the exchanges.\n\nMost enrollees, however, are shielded from those increases by federal subsidies. Some 82% of people who have signed up for 2017 plans are eligible for subsidies, according to Health & Human Services Department officials. The average subsidy for those enrolling on the federal exchange is $4,600 a year.\n\nConsumers are also shopping around for coverage. Some 56% of returning customers actively selected plan, up from 51% a year ago. Those who opt not to shop are automatically re-enrolled in their existing policy."}

It fixed many of the problems that afflicted its predecessor, the Knuckle, with oil-tight aluminum heads and chrome-plated rocker covers.\n\nFor some folks, the Pan has never been bettered. You can even buy a lookalike motor from S&S: It's designed to slot into a post-1970 Harley chassis and will cost you a cool $8,000.\n\nFor this round-up, though, we're focusing on custom Panheads that keep the retro vibe but crank up the style. The kind of bike you might want to take out early on a Sunday morning for a leisurely ride, letting the torque do the talking.\n\n\nWRECKED METALS Matt Whitlock builds hot rods as well as motorcycles. An eye for a line seems to come with that territory, and Matt's 1959 Panhead is super-clean. It's running a rebuilt motor boosted to 93 ci and a 4-speed 'box with suicide shift. The heavy-set looks of a stock Pan have gone, thanks to a rigid frame, a Springer front end and straight-shootin' custom pipes. Matt fabricated the narrow bars, foot controls and rear fender himself, giving the Harley a timeless, classic look. [More about this bike | Wrecked Metals]\n\nImage (and top image] by Dylan and Sara.\n\n\nMATT MACHINE Australian Matt Darwon has a double life. By day he's an award-winning architect, and by night (okay, by weekend) he's a world-class bike builder. He focuses on twins, whether Moto Guzzi, Ducati or Harley, and rides his bikes hard along the highways and backroads of New South Wales. He built this 1950 Pan for a friend, meticulously re-welding the frame and then grafting on a Kawasaki tank and Yamaha rear fender. An S&S Super E carb gives the engine a useful power boost and Matt made the pipes himself. Believe it or not, he also applied the intricate paint job. Is there no end to this guy's talents? [More about this bike | Matt Machine]\n\n\nNOISE CYCLES Scott Jones is a true original, and this is one of the most original custom Panheads out there. It's an 88ci 1952 EL model that won 'Best In Show' at Born Free, thanks to offbeat styling and remarkable craftsmanship. Jones cut his teeth working for Jesse James and then Ian Barry of Falcon Motorcycles, so he knows his stuff. In this case, that stuff includes a hand-fabricated aluminum tank, a drum brake from a Yamaha racebike, and a smattering of custom-machined components, including the triple trees. Fine work from a builder at the top of his game.

Denmark is also home to James Roper-Caldbeck, an Englishman who specializes in rebuilding vintage Harleys. In Europe, word has spread far and wide about his skills, and this 1948 Pan was commissioned by a Romanian enthusiast living in Germany. The need to pass strict German legislation resulted in a low-key build, but it still oozes style\u2014from the Springer front end to the rear fender, which was crafted from a 1930 Ford spare wheel carrier. In between is a thoroughly overhauled and reconfigured machine, with neat touches like cloth-covered wiring and a subtly cut-and-shut tank. [More about this bike | Customs From Jamesville]\n\n\nLOWBROW CUSTOMS Tyler Malinky of Lowbrow Customs is usually associated with the Brit chopper scene, but he can turn out a killer Harley when he wants to. This 'garage-built' Panhead caught the attention of virtually every custom magazine in the States last year; it's not a radical build, but it's beautifully proportioned and finished. Tyler cleaned up the frame, TIG welded any blemishes, and fitted a rigid rear section, a stretched neck and Triumph forks. After installing Amal carbs (yes, really), Malinky used a modified Bates taillight to supply the finishing touch. This Panhead is one of those bikes that just looks 'right.'

{"id": 426, "ended": true, "length": 918, "text": "When you think of Elder Scrolls and questing you immediately go into the exploration mode. Turn and run off in a random direction and you are guaranteed to find some lost ruin or dungeon. However, even the great RPG behemoth known as Skyrim has directions and quests to move the player through multiple story lines. Elder Scrolls Online has a similar approach. The team wanted to add in exploration to the zones and the game, but hey also have quests in to guide players through the zone pick up some valuable loot at low levels and to tell an overall story. We wanted to talk a little about how questing works in the game and what players can expect.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nWe got to play Daggerfall with the demo this past week. The opening zone has a quest line where you are helping some pirates put together a crew to get off this island under the thumb of an evil warlord. I don't want to give the story away, so that is all you get in terms of spoilers. There is a main quest line to find three crew members around the island and reunite them with the captain.\n\nQuests begin with cutaways to the character talking directly to you on screen. It is easy to get through and you can talk as much or as little as you want. Like any Elder Scrolls game you are given dialogue choices. You can get the main theme of the quest and say goodbye, or you can continue with more information during the conversation. I will admit that I am not a huge fan of cut scenes, however in Elder Scrolls Online they are not intrusive. The game does not center around the dialogue and you can still get the quest information and move on quickly. You can also get more information on the quests if you want to continue chatting through all of the options.\n\nAs you move through the zones there are a lot of quest areas that open up to you. Everything is very clearly marked on your map so it is easy to navigate. As you enter one of the areas in the main quest you will see other quests pop up in the zone to finish if you want. One of the journalists at the demo only did the main quest line and quickly moved to the next zone. I continued to find smaller quests that I wanted to do and pursued those instead. It took me longer to get through the zone, but I am also the completionist sort of player.\n\nSo the big question is what happens if you do not really \"pick up\" quests? There are fail safes built into the zones so that you will move through the content and get to the next areas. This is not as big a deal once you get out of the starter zone. The other important thing I noticed is that there are no \"kill ten rats\" quests at all, at least not in the starting zone. The quest lines are more centered around story and not about grinding some arbitrary number. Overall, it has more of an RPG feel than many MMOs do.\n\nThere is another very important element in Elder Scrolls Online questing: how you accomplish your goals. The team feels very strongly about giving you multiple ways to achieve your quest objectives. On one hand you are given a disguise to wear and travel through a pirate camp. This allows you to avoid all of the fights along the way. If you are more of a bash 'em style player you can just charge in and fight your way through the camp. You can also sneak around the NPCs to reach your objectives. There were multiple ways to get the quests done throughout the entire opening zone. I know the team is all about this dynamic and it is great for the players. At one point I was fighting everything I saw in the camp. Then I had to run back through to complete a quest and I did not want to have to fight so I put on the disguise. It made it much easier to move quickly. Having multiple options to complete your goals is definitely one of the best parts of questing in ESO.\n\nAt MMORPG.com we have talked a lot about quest design. I think one thing that Elder Scrolls gets right is that you do not feel like you're just grinding quests, at least not early on. It really does capture the RPG feeling of games like Skyrim where you can pick multiple paths, go on different adventures and you never feel like you are in a hamster wheel. The question will be how it plays out at higher levels, and whether the developers will run out of ways to keep things interesting for the PVE adventurers among us."}

If it still doesn't work try this link .\n\nMost people have heard of Murphy's Law. But most people, when they're referring to Murphy's Law, are actually referring to the rather pessimistic Finagle's Law, which is \"Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.\"\n\nMurphy's Law is quite different, and is actually a message of hope. Not only does it warn you about what things can go wrong, it'll even tell you how you can work around them, so as to make it impossible for Murphy's Law to actually happen.\n\nNow the AeroSpace industry, where things move very rapidly under very harsh and extreme conditions, is an unforgiving environment. And that's where Murphy's Law was first invented.\n\nIn 1949, the US Air Force was running a test series (Project MX981) to see what sort of acceleration (or G-forces) a human being could withstand. They were using a volunteer strapped into a rocket sled at what is now called Edward's Air Force Base, in California. The sled would accelerate up to about 1,000 kilometres per hour, and then stop suddenly. One of the volunteer human torpedoes was Colonel Stapp, who was also a medical doctor.\n\nNow our hero, Air Force Captain Edward A. Murphy Jnr., had designed a harness which strapped onto the volunteer. This harness held 16 sensors to measure the acceleration, or the G-forces, on different parts of the poor volunteer. As luck would have it, there were two ways that each sensor could be installed.\n\nThe rocket sled took off, and stopped suddenly, generating 40 Gs. Under 1 G, the average person weighs about 70 kg, but under 40 Gs, they weigh 40 times more - about 2.8 tonnes. 40 Gs is an enormous amount of acceleration - enough to push your ears onto the front of your head.\n\nAt the end of the experiment Colonel Stapp staggered off the rocket sled with blood-shot eyes and bleeds from a number of bodily orifices. When he looked at the results, he wasn't very happy - all the sensors registered zero! He called for Captain Murphy, who examined the sled - and found that every single one of those 16 sensors had been installed the wrong way round. Colonel Stapp had been strained in vain.\n\nIn a voice like thunder, Edward A. Murphy Jnr. proclaimed, \"If there are two or more ways to do something and one of those results in a catastrophe, then someone will do it that way\". This is the true and original form of Murphy's Law.\n\nOf course, you have to notice that little word, \"If\" in \"If there are two or more ways......\". Suppose that there's only one way. For example, if you design something that can be installed only one way, then it can't be put in the wrong way.\n\nConsider 240 V electrical power. You definitely don't want the full 240V power to jump directly to any of the other wires. So look at your standard 3-pin 240V electrical power plug. It's not symmetrical. There's only one way to insert it into a 240V electrical power socket.\n\nBut sometimes, it doesn't matter which way a thing goes in, so long as it goes in. So another way around Murphy's Law is to design something so that it doesn't matter which way it goes in.\n\nConsider the key.\n\nYour average car key has equal bumps on both sides, so it doesn't matter whether you put it in one way or the other - it always works. But your house key has bumps only on one side - this means that half the time, you'll put it in the wrong way. I guess it's an example of Murphy's Law that after half a century after Murphy's Law was first discovered, the house key manufacturers still haven't heard of it.\n\nSo once he had realised the message of Murphy's Law, Murphy himself redesigned the G-force sensors so that they could be installed only one way - and that particular problem was solved.\n\nThe next day Murphy's Law was officially declared at a Press Conference about the rocket sled test. A few months later Murphy's Law began to be mentioned in AeroSpace manufacturer's advertisements, and finally by the Flight Safety Foundation. As Murphy's Law spread across the planet, two things happened - people forgot that there was a real person called Murphy, and the Law got modified into the pessimistic form of \"If anything can go wrong, it will go wrong\".\n\nThe fact that many people confuse the optimistic Murphy's Law for the pessimistic Finagle's Law, is proof that Murphy's Law can even act upon itself."}

Dial the number (512-643-VEGA) and, after sitting through a few lascivious intimations, a link gets sent by way of text to hear the new single from VEGA INTL. Night School. It's very Neon Indian: old and new technologies coming together in a sly but seemingly sincere way, with throwback results that keep the prospect of a party in mind.\n\n\"Slumlord,\" the song triggered by the phone call, is big and bright in a manner that peers back to Neon Indian's chillwave roots but with a newer \u2014 and bigger and brighter \u2014 sense of scale. The beat is thwacking and spacious, its disco ambiance aided by a bulbous bassline and a gaggle of synthesizers in arpeggiated action. There's a lot going on, and its antic metabolism carries over to much of the album, Neon Indian's third since breaking out in 2009 and its first since 2011's Era Extra\u00f1a.\n\nAfter a brief, roiling electronic intro, \"Annie\" kicks off the album in earnest with a laid-back quasi-reggae vibe that evokes contemporaries like Peaking Lights as well as throwbacks from The English Beat to Men At Work. The sleek, colorful electronic tinge of it all makes for a sound far better than the notion of \"quasi-reggae\" might suggest, and it introduces '80s-mining inclinations that are never too distant in the mix. \"Street Level\" follows in the style of a strange, sloshing pop song that seems to have more sounds clamoring within it than any one song could contain, before \"Smut!\" clears out a bit in favor of an airier, more leisurely groove.\n\nThe vocals of Neon Indian chief Alan Palomo sound smeary and diaphanous throughout, with occasional falsetto rises that tip toward Prince but more often strike a wandering tone that favors suggestive impressions of feelings more than clear words. (\"Neoprene\" and \"magazine\" figure in \"Smut!\" in a way that seems significant.)

{"id": 436, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "There are two ways to support Buddhism. One is known as amisapuja, supporting through material offerings. These are the four supports of food, clothing, shelter and medicine. The act of amisapuja supports Buddhism by giving material offerings to the sangha of monks and nuns, enabling them to live in reasonable comfort for the practice of dhamma. This fosters the direct realization of the Buddha's teaching, in turn bringing continued prosperity to the Buddhist religion.\n\nBuddhism can be likened to a tree. A tree has roots, a trunk, branches, twigs, and leaves. The leaves and branches depend on the roots to absorb nutriment from the soil. The words we speak are like branches and leaves, which depend on a root\u2014the mind\u2014to absorb nutriment and send it out to them. These limbs in turn carry the fruit as our speech and actions. Whatever state the mind is in, skillful or unskillful, it expresses that quality outwardly through our actions and speech.\n\nTherefore the support of Buddhism through the practical application of the teachings is the most important kind of support. For example, in the ceremony of taking the precepts on observance days, the teacher describes those unskillful actions that should be avoided. But if you simply go through the ceremony of taking the precepts without reflecting on their meaning, progress is difficult. You will be unable to find the true practice. The real support of Buddhism must therefore be done through patipattipuja, the \"offering\" of practice, cultivating true restraint, concentration and wisdom. Then you will know what Buddhism is all about. If you don't understand through practice, you'll never know, even if you learn the whole Tipitaka.\n\nIn the time of the Buddha there was a monk known as Tuccho Pothila. This monk was one of the Buddha's most learned disciples, thoroughly versed in the scriptures and texts. He was so famous that he was revered by people everywhere and had eighteen monasteries under his care. When people heard the name \" Tuccho Pothila\" they were awestruck, and nobody would dare question anything he taught, so much did they revere his command of the teachings.\n\nOne day he went to pay respects to the Buddha. As he was paying his respects, the Buddha said, \"Ah, hello, Venerable Empty Scripture!\" Just like that! They conversed for a while until it was time to go, and then, as he was taking leave of the Buddha, the Buddha said, \"Oh, leaving now, Venerable Empty Scripture?\"\n\nThat was what the Buddha said. On arriving, \"Oh, hello, Venerable Empty Scripture.\" When it was time to go, \"Ah, leaving now, Venerable Empty Scripture?\" That was the teaching the Buddha gave. Tuccho Pothila was puzzled, \"Why did the Buddha say that? What did he mean?\" He thought and thought, turning over everything he had learned, until eventually he realized, \"It's true ! 'Venerable Empty Scripture'\u2014that's me, a monk who studies but doesn't practice.\" When he looked into his heart he saw that really he was no different from lay people. Whatever they aspired to, he also aspired to; whatever they enjoyed, he also enjoyed. There was no real samana within him, no truly profound quality capable of firmly establishing him in the Noble Way and providing true peace.\n\nSo he decided to practice. But there was nowhere for him to go to. All the teachers around were his own students. No one would dare accept him. Usually when people meet their teacher they become timid and deferential, and so no one would dare to become his teacher.\n\nFinally he went to see a certain young novice who was enlightened and asked to practice under him. The novice said, \"Yes, sure you can practice with me, but only if you're sincere. If you're not sincere then I won't accept you.\" Tuccho Pothila pledged himself as a student of the novice.\n\nThe novice then told him to put on all his robes. Now there happened to be a muddy bog nearby. When Tuccho Pothila had carefully put on all his robes\u2014expensive ones they were, too\u2014the novice said, \"Okay, now run down into that bog. If I don't tell you to stop, don't stop. If I don't tell you to come out, don't come out. Okay\u2026run!\"\n\nTuccho Pothila, neatly robed, plunged into the bog. The novice didn't tell him to stop until he was completely covered in mud. Finally the novice said, \"You can stop now.\" So he stopped. \"Okay, come on up!\" And he came out.\n\nClearly Tuccho Pothila had given up his pride. He was ready to accept the teaching. If"}

We are glad to see that the Administration has been forced to address the matter publicly as a result of the sustained public pressure from concerned voters as well as the ongoing press coverage of this issue. Obama acknowledged that Americans were uncomfortable with the surveillance that has been leaked to the media (and noted that he would be as well, if he weren't in the government). He made four commitments to transparency and reform during the press conference, and also published a whitepaper describing the legal interpretation of the PATRIOT Act that is used to attempt to justify bulk surveillance.\n\nWhile we're glad Obama is responding to the public's concerns, we take Obama's promises today with a healthy dose of skepticism. He may be paying lip service to accountability and transparency, but the devil will be in the details when it comes to whether his proposals will be effective.\n\nOther promises aside, President Obama did not commit to reducing the surveillance of Americans' communications or the communications of individuals abroad who are not suspected of any crime.\n\nObama's 4 Commitments \u2013 And What's Missing\n\nObama made 4 specific commitments around NSA surveillance. Here's an overview of what he did \u2013 and did not \u2013 promise to do.\n\n1. Obama will work with Congress to \"pursue appropriate reforms to Section 215 of the Patriot Act.\" This is the subsection of law used to justify the bulk collection of telephone records. Several bills have been introduced this Congress that attempt to tighten up this law, and we're glad to see Obama will be supportive of such efforts. However, Obama pointedly did not address Sec. 702, the other statute that the government has cited as supporting its broader surveillance, including the content of communications. And as we've explained, to return Americans to the rule of law and privacy and free speech rights that they deserve, we'll need changes well beyond Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. And even as to 215, Obama failed to explain what \"appropriate reforms\" might look like. Read what EFF thinks should be in NSA reform legislation.\n\n2. Obama will work with Congress to improve public confidence in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) by creating a public advocate that can defend privacy in the court. We were pleased that Obama specifically promised \"to make sure civil liberties concerns have an independent voice, in appropriate cases, by ensuring that the government's position is challenged by an adversary\" in the extremely secretive FISC. This could be a powerful reform, and one we would wholeheartedly support (especially, for example, if organizations like EFF can serve as the adversary on occasion). However, whether this is actually implemented in a meaningful way remains to be seen. A public advocate in the FISC should be involved in every proceeding, not just \"in appropriate cases.\" Furthermore, that advocate would need full access to the materials the government will be using in presenting its case to the judge. And finally, we remain concerned that this position will be subject to capture unless it has at least the sort of independence and protections that public defenders enjoy.\n\n3. Obama has directed the intelligence community \"to make public as much information about these programs as possible.\" First, \"these programs\" must include \"all surveillance programs,\" not just those that have been leaked so far. The NSA is supposed to put in place a full time civil liberties and privacy officer and create a website that details its surveillance practices. This should have happened long ago, though we think this is a step in the right direction. However, any such website must actually provide real answers about surveillance rather than obfuscations and word games.\n\n4. Obama is creating a \"high level group of outside experts to review our entire intelligence and communications technologies.\" This group will be tasked with creating an interim report in 60 days and a final report by the end of the year that should address the impact of surveillance technologies, including potential abuses as well as the impact on foreign policy. We're not certain whether Obama is planning on having the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board fulfill this role or whether he is planning on creating a new board, but it is very clear that any group of experts will struggle to have independence, adequate subpoena power, resources and staff time, as well as the political clout necessary to have a meaningful impact on our current surveillance regime. We hope that Obama ensures that this expert board has the information it needs to do its job.\n\nWhile we were skeptical about other aspects of the press conference, we were pleased to see Obama acknowledge the benefits of privacy enhancing technology. He stated that \"[T]echnology itself may provide us some additional safeguards. So for example, if people don't have confidence that the law, the checks and balances of the court and Congress, are sufficient to give us confidence that government's not snooping, well, maybe we can embed technologies in there that prevent the snooping regardless of what government wants to do. I mean, there may be some technological"}

This helped them search other e-mail accounts owned by Broadwell, including a Gmail account she used, which led them to the affair with Petraeus, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe case shows just how easy it is to discover the personal connections that can unmask anonymous parties. But the Petraeus affair is as much an outlier as an exemplar. The FBI rarely, if ever, gets involved when one person is harassing another online.\n\n\"I'm not aware of any case when the FBI has gotten involved in a case of online harassment,\" Justin Patchin, an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, said. \"The FBI definitely wouldn't get involved in your Joe Schmoe love triangle.\"\n\nThe affair began to unravel after the Florida woman, Jill Kelley, contacted an FBI friend after receiving threatening and harassing e-mails from an anonymous person who accused her of flirting with a man who was not identified in the e-mails. Kelley is a volunteer social planner for events at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, which is home to the military's Central Command. Petraeus was commander of CENTCOM from 2008 to 2010, when he left to take his position as head of the CIA.The e-mails, between 5 and 10 of them, began arriving last May, and reportedly told Kelley to \"back off\" and \"stay away\" from the unnamed man.\n\nKelley's FBI friend launched an investigation to determine if the threatening e-mails constituted a cybercrime.\n\nFBI investigators determined that the anonymous account from which the e-mails were sent belonged to Broadwell and her husband, who live in North Carolina. Reports are unclear about how they did this, but, according to the New York Times investigators were able to determine what other e-mail accounts had been accessed from the same computer address as the one that sent the harassing e-mails, which may have led them to Broadwell or her husband.\n\nThe information contained in the metadata of e-mail headers varies. It's unclear if the anonymous account was a Gmail account or came from another e-mail service provider. In Gmail, the header generally only includes the IP address and domains of the servers through which the e-mail was sent, as well as ones it passed through in transit to the recipient's inbox. Authorities would have had to contact Google to obtain information about the IP address that was used to log into the anonymous account and any other accounts that were accessed from the same address. But other e-mail providers, such as Yahoo, do include the sender IP address in the metadata.\n\nAgents considered that the anonymous e-mail account used to send the harassing e-mails might have been hacked by someone else who was sending the e-mails to Kelley. But they eventually were able to match the locations from which the e-mails were sent to the same locations, including hotels, where Broadwell was known to have been during the times the correspondence was set to Kelley, according to the Journal.\n\nBased on these connections, investigators obtained a warrant to monitor other e-mail accounts Broadwell used, including a Gmail account.\n\nIn examining these other accounts, agents uncovered sexually explicit e-mails that Broadwell exchanged with another party who also used a Gmail account. Investigators were not able to immediately identify Petraeus as the other party, however, because he'd set up his Gmail account using a pseudonym.\n\nInvestigators determined sometime during mid-summer that it belonged to Petraeus and that the two were having an affair. The reports do not say how investigators made that connection. According to the New York Times it's not known if the FBI gained access to Petraeus' personal e-mail account, or if its investigation relied solely on e-mails found in Broadwell's account.\n\nBroadwell's affair with Petraeus reportedly began two months after he took over the CIA and ended about four months ago, around the same time the FBI discovered the affair, according to Col. Steven Boylan, who spoke to ABC News.\n\nAfter the FBI contacted Broadwell the week of Oct. 21, she acknowledged the affair and provided authorities with her computer. The agents discovered several classified"}

Women worldwide devote an average of 4.5 hours each day to unpaid work \u2014 cooking, cleaning, changing the baby's diaper. Men contribute less than half that much time, according to the OECD.\n\nThe domestic division of labor remains staggeringly unbalanced in the United States, where female breadwinners now support 40 percent of homes. Women here typically spend two hours and 12 minutes daily on housework, while men spend one hour and 21 minutes.\n\n[The best age to get married if you don't want to get divorced]\n\nA 2015 survey by Working Mom, furthermore, found that female breadwinners who lived with male partners still reported handling the bulk of grocery shopping, meal preparation, bill-paying and cleaning.\n\n\"This isn't a global plot by men to oppress women,\" Melinda wrote. \"It's more subtle than that. The division of work depends on cultural norms, and we call them norms because they seem normal \u2014 so normal that many of us don't notice the assumptions we're making. But your generation can notice them \u2014 and keep pointing them out until the world pays attention.\"\n\n(Bill, it should be noted, drives their kids to school every other day.)\n\nMelinda is right about cultural norms in America and beyond. Even after moms could vote and become chief executives and run for president, dads maintained their status as primary provider status in popular culture.\n\nConsider Fusion's new breakdown of the Oscar-winning actresses through the years: Most have played wives.\n\nThe wife penalty\n\nOf course, that's a highly simplified explanation for why one sex shoulders more unpaid work. And it's not to say all women feel trapped in motherhood and the associated duties.\n\nBut, as Gates points out, for women who want to excel in their careers, the disproportionate load can create an unfair penalty. Men, it turns out, might be holding their partners back when they don't share non-work tasks.\n\nMothers in the United States who work full time, year round, make an average of $40,000, compared to $56,999 paid to fathers, according to the National Women's Law Center. That's 70 cents to the dollar.\n\nEconomists say this disparity probably comes from a blend of factors: Women are sometimes \"mommy tracked,\" or passed over for high-profile projects or promotions, when employers assume motherhood (but not fatherhood) zaps productivity. A 2015 study from the University of Georgia found that, for this reason, expectant mothers are often afraid to tell their bosses they're pregnant.\n\nWomen do take more time off to tend to family, but that's not always a choice. Sometimes, as the data shows, husbands just don't pull their domestic weight. They also tend to prioritize their careers over their wives', while wives tend to equally prioritize both partners' careers, according to a 2014 study of 25,000 Harvard Business School graduates.\n\nThe lesbian wage premium\n\nEvidence for the wife (or husband) penalty shows up in what researchers call the \"lesbian wage premium.\" Across years of research, women who have never lived with a male partner make more money than women who have.\n\nLast year, Marieka Klawitter, professor of public policy at the University of Washington, examined 29 studies across the Western Hemisphere on wages and sexual orientation and found a 9 percent earnings premium for lesbians over heterosexual women. (Gay men, meanwhile, faced an 11 percent penalty, compared to straight men.)\n\nShe controlled for parenthood and concluded lesbians simply had more education and work experience than the general female population.\n\n[The U.S. is still divided on what causes homosexuality]\n\nBut another study from the University of Nevada, which used national data from the year 2000, adds a stunning asterisk to Klawitter's findings: Lesbians who had previously lived with male partners made 9.5 percent less than those who'd never cohabitated with a husband figure.\n\nWere men actually the drags on women's earnings?\n\nAfter controlling for characteristics like education and experience, the authors found a 6.6 percent premium for cohabiting lesbians over cohabiting heterosexual women, with the premium falling to 5.2 percent if the lesbians had ever been married to a man.\n\n(Still, two-women"}
{"id": 450, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "I got chatting with a bloke on Waikiki Beach recently. A Collingwood supporter who wanted to talk about the state of the game. 'Roosy,' he said, 'what do you see as the biggest problems facing footy, and how would you fix them?'\n\nI didn't go to Hawaii to talk about footy. But this got me thinking. About all the meetings I'd been in with AFL executives like Adrian Anderson, Andrew Demetriou and Gillon McLachlan during my years as a coach. About so many conversations focused on the integrity of the competition. What I believed then I'm even more convinced of now: that footy's integrity is compromised.\n\nThe first thing we need to do is to leave the rules alone. There's been too much tinkering and too much change. So let's just take a deep breath, let the rules settle, and leave the game as is for the next year four or five years, until the next broadcast deal starts in 2023.\n\nThe game itself is in really good shape. It's even, because the equalisation mechanisms are kicking in after years of compromised drafts. It's good to watch, and thankfully no-one's talking about flooding now, or stoppages. So leave it be \u2013 and, while we're at it, keep the interchange system as it is and the Grand Final on Saturday afternoon, too.\n\nBut there are problems. There are five issues compromising the AFL that have been bubbling for years, some for decades, and there's also a relative newcomer to the debate: the need to deal with concussion and its ramifications so that the game's welfare keeps pace with the players.\n\nDRAW EQUALITY\n\nThe draw's not fair. We all know it. You could be playing the five bottom teams twice. You could be playing the five top teams twice. I don't subscribe to the 17-5 model that's been mooted, I think it's ridiculous, so what is the fairest draw model for the integrity of the competition? What's fairest is that you play everyone twice, home and away, but you're never going to have a 34-week season. So what's the next best option?\n\nThe players obviously want to spend less time at clubs, and I actually spoke to a high-profile player last year when I was coaching Melbourne and I said, 'Would you take less money if there was only 17 rounds?' He said, 'Yeah, I would'.\n\nSo, 17 rounds. Play each other once: home one year and away the other. Two byes stretch it to 19 weeks, and instead of the pre-finals week off I would have a 'wildcard' play-off round where it's seven-versus-ten and eight-versus-nine. So the bottom eight are finished, teams one to six get the week off, and then, bang, you go into the finals series of eight as we know it.\n\nBut there are problems. There are five issues compromising the AFL that have been bubbling for years, some for decades.\n\nThat stretches the season for the broadcasters, gives the players the two byes they want, gives the top six an extra bye, but also gives the 10th placed team a sneaky chance to play finals. There will be issues with broadcasters and that's why it needs to happen at the end of the current TV rights deal \u2013 clearly there's obstacles around how you'd get it done. But one of the biggest impediments to our game now is it started off as 12 teams playing each other twice, so 22 rounds. In an 18-team competition, there are soft draws and hard draws and we need a fairer, more equitable system.\n\nHow resistant will the AFL's broadcast partners be, given that they're tipping in more than $2 billion over six years for what they get now? If they're paying what they're paying now, then they're going to want 23 rounds, but if they're saying, 'Well, we'll pay less', and the players say, 'Well, we'll take less', who knows? Clearly there's some issues around it, but I'd love to think that the powers-that-be can sit down and work it out, because the fixture won't be fair until they do.\n\nRAISE THE DRAFT AGE\n\nThis is one I've been very strong about, for multiple reasons.

I believe hitting a woman is a despicable act, as a husband, I can't imagine a situation where I would do so, and as a father, I would absolutely destroy any \"man\" who put his hands on my 4-year-old daughter, or my son if he ever even had the thought of doing so to any woman. I believe that our justice system was designed around a single premise: that everyone is \"innocent until proven guilty\" ... however, that through time, there are certain acts, like domestic violence, where our societal views have begun to default immediately to guilt, and place the burden of proof, unfairly, on the accused. We view many of these types of cases as black-and-white, open-and-shut. ... Casting these individuals as horrible human beings who don't deserve to breathe, and the only picture of \"justice\" involves them paying mightily for their actions. I believe that there are certain situations in which those feelings inevitably influence the actions of those in law enforcement as well as the judicial system. ... Thus bringing about the importance of a trial by jury, and unanimous verdicts. Certain people, including Dallas' own Dale Hansen of WFAA Channel 8 have adopted the view that Hardy is without a doubt, guilty, and Mr. Hansen declared so in his statements regarding the Dallas Cowboys this week. ( Our complete coverage of Hardy/Cowboys angles is collected here.)\n\n\nHansen's \"unplugged'' piece from Wednesday is seen above. His Thursday roundtable featuring our own Mike Fisher is here.\n\n\nThe purpose of this piece is not to declare Greg Hardy to be innocent or guilty of the actions of which he was accused; it is simply to provide as true a picture as possible of the events that took place, their context, and their aftermath, to allow you (the reader) to come to your own conclusion.\n\nBackground\n\nHardy came into the NFL with questions about his off-field behavior, after being suspended for two games by the University of Mississippi for missing meetings and breaking team rules, and even kicked off the team before being reinstated. However, Tyrone Nix, Hardy's defensive coordinator at Ole Miss told the Charlotte Observer that Hardy never had any incidence involving violence towards women in his time there, and that he \"has always been a guy of high character, as far as respect to others.\" Prior to the incident in question, Hardy's criminal record consisted only of traffic violations, including speeding, on operator's license (waived), window-tinting violation (waived), and driving without registration (waived).\n\nHardy and the alleged victim, Nicole Holder, entered a romantic relationship in September 2013, the start of Hardy's finest year of professional football, while Holder was employed as a waitress at a Charlotte nightclub. They remained in a relationship which a friend of Holder described as \"really good, really bad, with nothing in between\" until they broke up in February 2014, although they did stay in contact and occasionally engage intimately.\n\nAfter the couple split, Holder entered a brief relationship with the rapper Nelly, which had upset Hardy, but by the time of the incident in question, they were trying to \"reconcile the relationship.\"\n\nOn May 10, 2014, two nights before the incident in question, Holder was seen following Hardy out of her place of employment, The Epicenter nightclub in Charlotte, crying and blocking his car from leaving. Security guards involved the police after Holder kicked the door of Hardy's car.\n\nThe night of the incident\n\nThe night of May 12, 2014, Hardy, and Holder, along with Hardy's assistant and other friends, went out drinking. Holder later admitted to snorting cocaine that night, although a co-worker enacted her Fifth Amendment rights when asked about taking cocaine with Holder that night. After a night of partying, including Hardy getting upset when a Nelly song was played in one of the clubs they visited, they returned to Hardy's apartment and continued to party.\n\nThe 9-1-1 Calls: At approximately 4:18 a.m., Hardy made a call to 9-1-1, in which he stated the following: That Holder had hit him in the face twice, and wouldn't leave the apartment, and that she told him to break her arm when he asked her to leave. Hardy's assistant was trying to retain her but she was attempting to his Hardy with a shoe. Hardy stated that she wouldn't let him close the door to the apartment and that he \"can't touch her to get her out\". That he was trying to stay away from her, and that he was behind the bar, and wasn't touching her, but that she had broken some glass and he couldn't walk through his kitchen. Additionally he repeatedly asked \"What do I do?\" When asked if he needed a medic he stated that he was \"a little swollen\" but didn't notice"}

Points are wiped when the year anniversary of the respective offence is reached. No driver has yet reached the 12-point limit.\n\nHaas driver Esteban Gutierrez leads the table after the Japanese GP with seven points, five of which were collected in the space of just three races either side of the summer break. The Mexican picked up three at Spa for blocking Pascal Wehrlein on the 200mph Kemmel Straight.\n\nSebastian Vettel runs into Nico Rosberg at the start of the Malaysia GP. Sebastian Vettel runs into Nico Rosberg at the start of the Malaysia GP.\n\nChampionship leader Nico Rosberg is next up with six after being found at fault for collisions with Lewis Hamilton (Austria), Max Verstappen (Germany) and Kimi Raikkonen (Malaysia). Despite not having a reputation as one of the sport's more aggressive drivers, Valtteri Bottas also has collected six points, as has Sauber's Felipe Nasr.\n\nThe F1 drivers' half-term report\n\nLewis Hamilton is one of five drivers with a clean licence, while Max Verstappen has not added any extra points to his record in 2016 despite a string of high-profile wheel-to-wheel battles.\n\nVerstappen accrued a record eight points in his debut F1 campaign last season, but just three now remain on his licence from Abu Dhabi last November with the Red Bull driver successfully steering clear of trouble with the stewards so far in 2016.\n\nF1 driver penalty points (after 2016 Japanese GP) Points Driver Next points dropped 7 Esteban Gutierrez May 1, 2017 (2 points) 6 Valtteri Bottas November 13, 2016 (2 points) Felipe Nasr November 14, 2016 (2 points) Nico Rosberg July 3, 2017 (2 points) 5 Daniil Kvyat May 1, 2017 (3 points) 4 Carlos Sainz May 1, 2017 (2 points) Pascal Wehrlein May 29, 2017 (4 points) Sebastian Vettel July 10, 2017 (2 points) Rio Haryanto March 19, 2017 (2 points) 3 Max Verstappen November 29, 2016 (3 points) Sergio Perez September 17, 2017 (3 points) 2 Fernando Alonso November 29, 2016 (2 points) Nico Hulkenberg April 17, 2017 (2 points) Kevin Magnussen May 15, 2017 (2 points) Marcus Ericsson May 29, 2017 (2 points) Kimi Raikkonen June 19, 2017 (2 points) Jolyon Palmer July 2, 2017 (2 points) Esteban Ocon September 18, 2017 (2 points) 0 Lewis Hamilton, Daniel Ricciardo, Romain Grosjean, Felipe Massa, Jenson Button\n\nDriver reprimands\n\nAlthough Hamilton has no penalty points to his name, the world champion jointly leads the way for reprimands after the season's opening 17 rounds - leaving him one away from a grid penalty.\n\nReprimands are usually issued by stewards for more minor infringements and a 10-place grid drop is applied if a driver receives three of them during any one season, provided two were meted out for driving offences.\n\nHamilton's two reprimands both fall into this category. In Bahrain he was punished for briefly reversing in the pit lane after qualifying, while in Russia he was warned about not rejoining the track in the correct manner during practice.\n\nThe world championship leader, who took a big grid penalty after the summer break for exceeding engine elements, is therefore one more reprimand of any kind away from a costly 10-place drop.\n\nToro Rosso's Carlos Sainz is the only other driver on two reprimands for the season."}
{"id": 456, "ended": true, "length": 1005, "text": "Dr John Bates' disclosures about the manipulation of data behind the so-called 'Pausebuster' paper is the biggest scientific scandal since 'Climategate' in 2009 when, as Britain's Daily Mail reported, thousands of leaked emails revealed scientists were trying to block access to data, and using a 'trick' to conceal embarrassing flaws in their claims about global warming.\n\nBritain's Mail on Sunday today revealed astonishing evidence that the organisation that is the world's leading source of climate data rushed to publish a landmark paper that exaggerated global warming and was timed to influence the historic Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nA high-level whistleblower has told this newspaper that America's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) breached its own rules on scientific integrity when it published the sensational but flawed report, aimed at making the maximum possible impact on world leaders including Barack Obama and David Cameron at the UN climate conference in Paris in 2015.\n\nThe report claimed that the 'pause' or 'slowdown' in global warming in the period since 1998 \u2013 revealed by UN scientists in 2013 \u2013 never existed, and that world temperatures had been rising faster than scientists expected. Launched by NOAA with a public relations fanfare, it was splashed across the world's media, and cited repeatedly by politicians and policy makers.\n\nBut the whistleblower, Dr John Bates, a top NOAA scientist with an impeccable reputation, has shown The Mail on Sunday irrefutable evidence that the paper was based on misleading, 'unverified' data.\n\nIt was never subjected to NOAA's rigorous internal evaluation process \u2013 which Dr Bates devised.\n\nHis vehement objections to the publication of the faulty data were overridden by his NOAA superiors in what he describes as a 'blatant attempt to intensify the impact' of what became known as the Pausebuster paper.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Dr Bates accused the lead author of the paper, Thomas Karl, who was until last year director of the NOAA section that produces climate data \u2013 the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) \u2013 of 'insisting on decisions and scientific choices that maximised warming and minimised documentation\u2026 in an effort to discredit the notion of a global warming pause, rushed so that he could time publication to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy'.\n\nThe scandal has disturbing echoes of the 'Climategate' affair which broke shortly before the UN climate summit in 2009, when the leak of thousands of emails between climate scientists suggested they had manipulated and hidden data. Some were British experts at the influential Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia.\n\nHis disclosures are likely to stiffen President Trump's determination to enact his pledges to reverse his predecessor's 'green' policies, and to withdraw from the Paris deal \u2013 so triggering an intense political row.\n\nAs The Mail continues, whatever takes its place, said Dr Bates, \"there needs to be a fundamental change to the way NOAA deals with data so that people can check and validate scientific results. I'm hoping that this will be a wake-up call to the climate science community \u2013 a signal that we have to put in place processes to make sure this kind of crap doesn't happen again.\n\n\"I want to address the systemic problems. I don't care whether modifications to the datasets make temperatures go up or down. But I want the observations to speak for themselves, and for that, there needs to be a new emphasis that ethical standards must be maintained.\" He said he decided to speak out after seeing reports in papers including the Washington Post and Forbes magazine claiming that scientists feared the Trump administration would fail to maintain and preserve NOAA's climate records. Dr Bates said: \"How ironic it is that there is now this idea that Trump is going to trash climate data, when key decisions were earlier taken by someone whose responsibility it was to maintain its integrity \u2013 and failed.\"\n\nNOAA not only failed, but it effectively mounted a cover-up when challenged over its data.\n\nAfter the paper was published, the US House of Representatives Science Committee launched an inquiry into its Pausebuster claims. NOAA refused to comply with subpoenas demanding internal emails from the committee chairman, the Texas Republican Lamar Smith, and falsely claimed that no one had raised concerns about the paper internally. Last night Mr Smith thanked Dr Bates \"for courageously stepping forward to tell the truth about NOAA's senior officials playing fast and loose with the data in order to meet a politically predetermined conclusion\". He added: \"The Karl study used flawed data, was rushed to publication in an effort to support the President's climate change agenda, and ignored NOAA's own standards for scientific study.\" Professor Curry, now the president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network, said last night: 'Large adjustments to the raw data, and substantial changes in successive dataset versions, imply substantial uncertainties.' It was time, she said, that politicians and policymakers took these uncertainties on board.\n\nRead more here..."}

It is not favorable, to put it mildly. All you have to do to realize that is to type his name into the search box of this blog and see what comes up: Anger at his attacks on celebrities who have died of cancer; mockery of his pretending to be a scientist and attacking Jimmy Kimmel for \"hate speech\" about vaccines; alarm at his threats delivered with somewhat plausible deniability against scientists; further alarm at his \"natural biopreparedness\" and homeopathy for Ebola; and, of course amusement at his New World Order conspiracy mongering. In terms of blog fodder, Adams is the gift that keeps on giving. Unfortunately, in terms of his influence against science and medicine and for pseudoscience and quackery, his influence is not insubstantial, so much so that when the opportunity presents itself I feel obligated to discuss him.\n\n\nThe opportunity has presented itself in the form of an excellent summation of the empire of pseudoscience and quackery that is Mike Adams by Sacha Feinman entitled Meet The Internet Entrepreneur Profiting Off The Anti-Vaxxer Movement. Of course, I have one quibble about this title. Adams profits off of way more than the antivaccine movement. Quackery, fear mongering about food, Scientology-like hatred of psychiatry to the point where after the Sandy Hook school massacre, he immediately blamed psychiatric medications for the rampage of Adam Lanza, the perpetrator of the massacre. But that's just a quibble. The article itself tells the tale quite well. It also confirms something I've been writing for quite a while now, namely how Adams got his quacky start selling Y2K scams:\n\nTowards the turn of the millennium, the Y2K bug was much on the mind of the media, representing perhaps the first great conspiracy of the digital age. True believers held that the seemingly simple switchover from 12/31/99 to 1/1/00 would cause computers and electronic systems the world over to crash, triggering international crises of every conceivable sort. Adams saw the opportunity in the situation, and began to sell supposed \"information products\" that would insulate his paying audience from the oncoming chaos, which, of course, never came. In a since-deleted excerpt on Adams' site published by ZDNet, Adams boasted that in 1999, \"in an effort to fine-tune his web marketing techniques, Michael [Adams] launched a six-month experiment to determine what kind of revenues are possible when combining his proprietary techniques and technologies with a high-awareness topic. The result? With the help of only one employee, he created a subscriber base of over 50,000 people and sold over $400,000 worth of information products while offering an open-ended, 100% moneyback [sic] guarantee.\" This subscriber base was largely won over by Adams' then infamous \"39 Unanswered Questions about Y2K.\" In a foreshadowing of the sorts of the \"listicles\" that would drive traffic to both Natural News and the site's advertisers (not to mention BuzzFeed), Adams demonstrated a remarkable ability to frame a controversial issue in a manner perfectly suited for digital consumption. The widely shared email consisted of a series of fear-mongering questions such as, \"Why is there not a single Fortune 1000 firm that has said, in its 10-Q SEC statement, that it is fully, unequivocally Y2K-compliant?\" Critics panned the listicle as, \"a national spamming campaign against the press and politicians to stir up enough anxiety to clear the shelves of Y2K supplies\" and, \"the best publicity stunt I've seen.\"\n\nSo from the beginning, Adams was talented. He saw the possibilities in web marketing to drive traffic to his sites and use that to monetize them very early on, and to monetize them selling scams. In this, we can see him honing his early techniques.

{"id": 464, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "How do we accept the truth? What ingredients are necessary for a person to change their most treasured beliefs if these beliefs are actually erroneous? Here we will review the \"four essentials\" for accepting truth. All four of these qualities are indispensable. If even one is missing or lacking, it will be extremely difficult for a person to accept and embrace reality. Let us review each one in turn:\n\n1. Intelligence\n\nFirst, in order to accept the truth, a person must utilize their inherent intelligence. This includes the ability to use logic, reason, and intuition to understand a complex problem\u2014often called critical thinking. Many people lose their critical thinking skills when they are subjectively biased toward their own paradigm or worldview. Critical thinking is important because it allows a person to think objectively, rather than subjectively, and is an essential step for actually learning the truth. The moment we cease to think critically, we cease to intelligently engage in disciplined thought that is clear, rational, open-minded, and informed by evidence.\n\nA great hindrance to learning truth occurs when we already have our conclusions formed before even examining the evidence. This happens when people think, for instance, \"I know this is true, so I will refuse to look at any evidence to the contrary until I find something that might substantiate my already-determined beliefs.\" Thinking in this way does not allow a person to learn or progress in the direction of truth. In reality, our thinking should be the other way around. One should form conclusions after weighing all the evidence, rather than ignoring most of the evidence and searching until one can find some small piece of evidence to support an already drawn conclusion. Sherlock Holmes aptly described this situation when he said, \"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts\" (Arthur Conan Doyle, A Scandal in Bohemia).\n\n2. Truth\n\nSecond, in order to accept truth, a person must have access to true information regarding the church's actual history, origins, and doctrines. Many people are unaware of what actually happened when our church began and during the intervening years since then. They are exposed only to the church's version of its history, which unfortunately is highly romanticized and inaccurate. As a result, they are \"only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it\" (D&C 123:12). Still other people are afraid to look at the actual true history because they have been taught all their lives that any negative information about the church is \"of the adversary\" or \"poison for the soul.\" Perhaps such people do not realize that \"the truth stands boldly and unafraid; it is not shaken by the testing; For truth, if it be truth, arises from each testing stronger, more secure. Those that would silence doubt are filled with fear\" (Robert Weston). Only error fears investigation. If you are being instructed not to investigate something, then there is probably something being hidden that you deserve to know.\n\nAlong with this second essential is included the incentive and personal drive to study the true information and validate its sources. Many people, upon discovering the truth regarding our church, find themselves absorbed in months and months of fascinating study. Because a whole new world of information has been opened to their view, they acquire an insatiable desire to learn the truth. This desire and thirst for truth is crucial for anyone who wishes to acquire wisdom and live a life of integrity. It is important that each person arrives at their own conclusion based upon their personal study and critical thinking.\n\nPerhaps you have heard the story of a young man who approached the great thinker, Aristotle, and asked him the profound question: \"How can I have wisdom?\" Aristotle smiled and replied, \"Follow me.\" The young man followed closely as they made their way into a pool of water. Aristotle suddenly turned and pushed the young man under the water. The student flailed with his arms, but to no avail. Aristotle was the stronger of the two, and he held the struggling lad's head beneath the surface. At the last possible moment, Aristotle pulled him up, dragged him over to the edge, and sat him down. Coughing and gasping for air, the student could hardly believe what had just occurred. Unmoved by the young man's confusion and surprise, Aristotle simply asked him, \"Young man, when I held you under the water, what did you want more than anything in the world?\" He sputtered between coughs, \"Air, sir . . . air!\" Aristotle then responded, \"When you want wisdom as badly as you wanted air, then you will find it.\"\n\nJohn Adams observed: \"Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\" In our information age, the facts and the evidence are readily available to us. We need only to have"}

She had stacks of CDs in her car, went to concerts of artists like Sean Paul, and would go to parties where hot songs would blare. She was also an active member of the choir at her church: Solid Rock Church of the Nazarene.\n\n\nThen she started having seizures.\n\n\nThe first one happened while she slept in her bedroom in Rosedale, Queens in New York City on the night of March 3, 2005. She had just turned 22. Her mother rushed her to the emergency room, where doctors stabilized her. Several brain scans and blood tests gave no clue as to why she seized.\n\n\nSoon after, she had another, this time at a friend's barbecue. She blacked out, fell down and started to shake like crazy as her brain cells went out of whack, firing electrical signals without pause.\n\n\nAt first, the seizures seemed to occur randomly. In the spring of 2006, however, she noticed a pattern. At the time, Sean Paul's \"Temperature\" was sitting at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, continually being played on urban radio stations. It was playing at nearly every barbecue and party she went to. That was a problem: \"Every time it would go on, I would pass out and go into a seizure,\" she recalls.\n\n\nAll it seemed to take was a few seconds of the song to send Gayle to the floor. \"That's the last thing you would think,\" she explains, \"but I did it at home one time and it happened again.\"\n\n\nTo Gayle, it was clear that the music was causing her seizures. Afraid no one would believe her, she didn't tell a soul except for a lone confidant. Her neurologist, Alan Ettinger at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center (LIJ) in New Hyde Park, N.Y., was in the dark as he put her through a gauntlet of prescriptions. She would eventually try out six antiseizure drugs. The medications offered little relief.\n\n\n\"When you look at individuals who have seizures and whose seizures have not responded to a good trial of two antiseizure medications, the chances of becoming seizure-free from another medication, or another after that, is very slim,\" says Ettinger.\n\n\nTo try to figure out how to treat Gayle, Ettinger and a colleague admitted her to an epilepsy monitoring unit in early 2007. The idea was to let her have a seizure. For four days, she wore a cap studded with electrodes so that doctors could observe her brain waves and videotape her.\n\n\nThey took her off her medications. No seizure came.\n\n\nThe doctors then tried keeping her awake. Nothing.\n\n\nGayle was tired of waiting; she had plans to fly to Jamaica the next day. So she told them to hand over her iPod. She put \"Temperature\" on repeat and drifted off to sleep.\n\n\nShe seized three times that night.\n\n\n\"The doctors were flabbergasted; they were speechless,\" says Gayle. \"They couldn't believe what I was saying was actually true.\"\n\n\nThe next day, Stacey went to JFK Airport on her way to the Caribbean. But as she approached her gate, she overheard Sean Paul blaring from an airport bar.\n\n\nShe never made it onto her flight.\n\n\nSoon, the reaction spread. Throughout the next year other popular hip-hop and R&B songs like Rihanna's repetitively infectious \"Umbrella\" and crooner Sean Kingston's earnest \"Beautiful Girl\" sent Gayle to the floor. She was also responding to alternative music and the sound of the drums that accompanied her church choir's performances. Suddenly it seemed like the only types of music that weren't causing her to have a seizure were jazz and classical\u2014both of which she didn't particular like.\n\n\nGayle was forced to drop out of school that fall because of her illness. Personalized ring tones drove her nuts. \"When people's phones were going off in class, I was having a lot of seizures at school,\" she says. \"Life just turns upside down when you take music out of it: I remember sitting outside of stores in the mall and crying because I can't even go shopping or sit in a restaurant and eat.\"\n\n\nShe briefly took a job, working at a Bank of America in Manhattan. But, she couldn't handle the noises on the subway, and she would seize frequently both on her commute and at the office.\n\n\nWith medication having been an unequivocal failure, her doctors were wondering if they could do anything other than keep music away from her\u2014an unlikely proposition.\n\n\nMacdonald Critchley first described musicogenic epilepsy\u2014the technical term for seizures caused by music\u2014in a 1937 paper, according to celebrated neurologist Oliver Sacks's latest book"}

Sigmundur Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson had stepped down amid public fury at revelations in the Panama Papers that his family had sheltered money offshore.\n\nThe Guardian revealed this month that while an MP, Benediktsson \u2013 whose name also appeared in the Panama Papers \u2013 had himself sold millions of kr\u00f3na of assets in a major Icelandic bank's investment fund as the state was about to seize control of the country's failing financial sector at the peak of the 2008 crisis.\n\nThe prime minister, a member of one of Iceland's wealthiest families, has denied any wrongdoing, but newly leaked documents suggest his relationship with Glitnir bank was close enough to raise serious questions about a possible conflict of interest between his roles as an MP and one of its most valued clients.\n\nIceland PM sold bank assets hours before financial crash, leaks show Read more\n\nGlitnir Holdco, which administers the collapsed bank's estate, has since sought an injunction preventing Stundin and Reykjavik Media, the Icelandic news outlets that worked on the investigation with the Guardian, from publishing more of the leaked data. Benediktsson has said he had nothing to do with the gagging order.\n\nDespite the scandals, polls show the prime minister's conservative Independence party \u2013 a member of 19 of the 27 governments that have run modern Iceland \u2013 is now edging ahead in the race with its main rival, the Left-Green Movement, which earlier this month held a clear lead.\n\nHeaded by 41-year-old Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, the Left-Greens have largely succeeded the more traditional Social Democrats as the leading party of the Icelandic left, campaigning against inequality and for greater investment in public services and higher taxes for the better-off.\n\nPolls show nearly half of Iceland's voters would like the popular Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, seen as representing a new breed of politician, to be prime minister \u2013 around twice the number who say they plan to vote for her party. A centre-left government would be only the second since Iceland won full independence from Denmark in 1944.\n\nAt least six other parties \u2013 including a new Centre Party launched by Gunnlaugsson \u2013 could win seats in the 63-member al\u00feingi in a continuing fragmentation of Icelandic politics that reflect mounting voter dissatisfaction with the cronyism and corruption many see as endemic in their political and business classes.\n\n\nIceland was plunged into a deep recession following the 2008 crash, during which its three major banks, including Glitnir, failed with liabilities of 11 times the country's GDP. The stock market fell 97%, the value of the kr\u00f3na halved, and Iceland became the first western European country in 25 years to ask the International Monetary Fund for a bailout.\n\n\nA perception now exists that Benediktsson, 47, \"is part of the elite that crashed the system\", said Egill Helgason, a political commentator at the public broadcaster, RUV. The prime minister and his circle suffer from a serious lack of trust in the wake of recent scandals, he said.\n\nWith growth surging at 7.2% last year, however, and unemployment down at just 2.5%, it seems likely that many Icelandic voters still see the Independence party, which has campaigned on a platform of tax cuts and more business investment, as the most likely to deliver economic stability."}

You are so committeed up and you have so much extra dough sitting around* that you've hired a design agency \"to develop a rebrand\"? (Full press release at the end of this post.) Ugh, fine, okay, I'll take your survey. I love the library, I'm happy to help.\n\nHere, everyone, take the survey.\n\nThe first question proposes changing the \"brand\" from Seattle Public Library to Seattle Public Libraries. Rather than asking what's better, what appeals to you more, what sounds most like the library as you think of it, they ask you what the difference is. As if it's a test to see if you know what words mean. The difference is that one is singular and one is plural.\n\nTheir survey:\n\nSorry to show you my answers. You should answer your own personal truth.\n\nAs for which \"brand\" identity of the two evokes \"communities\"? Curious question. \"Communities\" is plural, so the only one that evokes the plural word is the other plural word. Is that really what you wanted to ask? Is this a survey or is this a new-media, feel-good smokescreen for a decision someone wants to make without being on the hook for making a decision? Just change the name if you want to change the name! Clearly, someone wants to change the name, but they also and just as importantly want to be able to say, later, \"Well, Susan, everyone who answered the survey said 'libraries' evokes 'communities' more than 'library' does, so we better change it, because democracy.\"\n\nAs for question 3: Far be it from me to just underline what a pointless exercise this is with an example, but something that would concretely help us move forward as a community even more than whatever letters you want to hang on the wall is, say, having a microfilm/microfiche situation that doesn't require running back and forth between the microfilm machine and the printer and having to punch in very long sequences of numbers and passwords each time one wants to print a single page. But that's just me. (Sincerely, thanks for all the help couple weeks back, library staff\u2014you are awesome. It's the administrative apparatus around you, epitomized by this goofy rebrand, that fills my head with question marks.)\n\nOkay, moving on, it's time to see the new \"brand statement\"! Here we go. Screengrab from my phone while I was sitting at Madison Pub last night trying to help the library.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the brand new, surely-worked-over-to-death-by-a-whole-bunch-of-people brand statement.\n\nI didn't have room in the field to type the following:\n\n1. Where. Is. Your. Serial. Comma. What. Is. Wrong. With. You. \"Provides\" and \"experiences\" are both verbs, and when you don't have a serial comma after \"experiences\" to make things clear, you can't help but read \"experiences\" as a verb the first time through (you read it the same way you read \"provides\") and be confused when you get to \"and learning for all.\" How do you experience \"and learning\"? God, I wish I could experience some \"and learning\" right now. Oh you mean \"experiences\" as a noun! After you read it five or six times, it becomes clear what the SEATTLE PUBLIC LIBRARY is trying to say using words.\n\n2. Kind of. I mean, how much difference is there between \"learning\" and \"knowledge\"? How much overlap on the Venn diagram do \"learning\" and \"knowledge\" have? If you're going to put three nouns in a row (and confusingly make one of them seem like a verb) it might be clearer to choose three nouns that are distinct from each other, instead of two that are slightly redundant (one of which doesn't even read as a noun the first time through).\n\n3. \"We preserve and create opportunities for the people of Seattle who make it such a dynamic and desirable place to live.\" Huh. Sounds nice. But then it makes you think. What about the people who do not make Seattle both \"dynamic and desirable\"? What about painfully shy people who rarely leave the house? Are they good, too? Or is the library only for people doing cartwheels and condo conversions?\n\n4. \"When we're empowered as individuals, we're STRONGER TOGETHER.\" Is that possibly from some other piece of text"}
{"id": 472, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "I try to lay my biases out on the table when it comes to reviewing games here so you can get a feel for when I may be judging a game too harshly or if I'm making myself deliberately oblivious to some of the more glaring faults. I believe this works well as you know things like survival horror and open world games are likely to get rated down whilst things like RTS, RPGs and FPSs are usually going to be rated slightly higher (although there are notable exceptions). Still though I try my best to rate a game based on its merits in relation to other titles within the same genre and thus Sleeping Dogs, the latest instalment in the True Crime series from Luxoflux and United Front Games, will be judged against other recent titles like Prototype 2.\n\nSleeping Dogs takes place in present day Hong Kong putting you in control of an undercover agent named Wei Shen. Your job is to infiltrate the infamous Sun On Yee triad in hopes to bring them down from the inside starting out by using one of your former connections to gain a first meeting with one of their Red Poles, Winston Chu. From there the game takes the usual route of open world escalation, starting you off in the doldrums beating up vendors for protection money as you work your way up the gang hierarchy. At the same time the police want to use your connections to help further their cause in other areas leading you to bust up drug rings, smuggling operations and prostitution syndicates.\n\nVisually Sleeping Dogs is quite vibrant drawing inspiration from the real Hong Kong's neon saturated environment. From what I can recall the graphics are pretty much on par with other open world titles like Grand Theft Auto IV meaning they're pretty good but they make trade offs in order to keep the game running smoothly as you rush through busy streets crowded with people and cars. I had to actually turn the graphics down slightly from their ultra maximum settings due to the frame rate dropping so much (although that might be an issue rather than a compliment as I'll expand on later).\n\nLike all open world games Sleeping Dogs features a multitude of different core game mechanics, mini-games and open world events to while away your time with. The main core of the game is a cross between an Arkham Asylum/City style beat-em-up and Grand Theft Auto's weapon focused game play. Sleeping Dogs also throws free running in there for good measure, allowing you to climb all over different parts of Hong Kong in the search for collectibles, upgrades and cold hard cash. I guess the feeling I'm trying to convey here is that there is certainly a lot to do in Sleeping Dogs, possible even more than I've come across in other recent open world titles.\n\nThe main plot of the story is progressed via 2 different styles of missions: ones with the triads and the other with the police. These take the usual typical open world style of giving you a way point on your map that you can travel to at your leisure and there's no hard and fast requirement to do the triad and police missions in sync with each other. Indeed I chose to most of the triad missions first as I found them to be more fun (and more rewarding) which did leave me in the rather awkward position of having to travel the full length of the map constantly as I had progressed out of the area in which the police missions take place. I kind of feel like this could have been remedied by the developers by having multiple police locations for the missions which would've saved me quite a bit of time.\n\nThe experience system also works along the separate cop/triad lines with each of them giving you access to an unique set of upgrades. The triads are focused mostly on melee upgrades, giving you additional moves as well as improving your effectiveness in melee combat. The cop upgrades focus more on vehicles and weapons, giving you access to things like a slim jim to jack cars without setting off the alarms. In addition to the two main upgrade paths there's also several ancillary upgrade paths that unlock more cars, additional melee moves as well as upgrades to your total health.\n\nThe main experience system works on the idea of stars, with 3 being the highest you can get. They work in different directions however with the police experience starting off at maximum and then you losing points for doing things wrong (like running people over) whilst the triad experience increases, ostensibly for being as brutal as you possibly can be. These two things are in direct competition with each other and it's often a choice between maximising one or the other. What got me though is that the bars need to be completely filled in order for them to be considered achieved meaning that for the police experience you can't do 1 thing wrong and for the triads you really need to go all out at all times in order to get it. The triads one I can understand, its something you work towards, but the cops one feels a bit anal as you can lose points by simply touching another car, depriving you of an entire block of experience even if"}

It's about the Tower of Joy. The image we get from Ned's description is pretty powerful. But it doesn't make sense. The top three kingsguards, including the lord commander amd the best knight in ages, Ser Arthur Dayne are present there. Lyanna is in the tower, she asked Ned to promise him something. This, so says the general consensus us little Jon Snow, who is Lyanna's and Rhaegar's. No sense denying this ;) However, what are the Kingsguards doing fighting Eddard? Eddard would never hurt Lyanna, nor her child. The little one would be safe with Eddard as well, him being a close relative. So I ask you, was there someone else with Lyanna and Jon? You'll need to wait for future books to find out more about the Tower of Joy and what happened there, I fear. I might mention, though, that Ned's account, which you refer to, was in the context of a dream... and a fever dream at that. Our dreams are not always literal.

First time that LotR has lost the position since about four editions into the list ... nearly 7 years ago. That's pretty astonishing, considering the huge LOTR presence right now. Very gratifying. I hope I can hold on. Have you seen _The Fellowship of the Ring_ movie yet? There are not a few fans curious as to your reaction to it, and whether you think it'll spell the beginning of a revival of major Hollywood fantasy projects. :) I have seen the movie three times so far. I have quibbles, certainly... but all in all I thought it was magnificent, far and away the best fantasy film ever made. As to whether it will mean a general revival of fantasy in Hollywood... well, we can hope. If they are all done as well as FELLOWSHIP, that would be exciting indeed, but I fear they won't be. On a personal level, the studios aren't lining up to buy A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE yet, but it does look as though I am about to close a film deal on \"The Skin Trade,\" and there is some interest in WILD CARDS as well. The WILD CARDS revival is going very well, by the way. I just turned in the first new book, DEUCES DOWN, which is scheduled for publication this summer.

Most of the study's complex computations were carried out on powerful supercomputer clusters at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC).\n\nSuperposition of computer models of human melanopsin (violet) and squid rhodopsin (green). Similar to visual pigments, melanopsin provides the interface between the physical world, responsible for light detection, and the physiological world of brain signaling. Melanopsin mediates a process termed 'photoentrainment,' which takes in light to set the clock of \"circadian rhythms.\" These rhythms (often termed the body clock) represent the biological implementation of the 24-hour day/night and optimize the corresponding physiology\n\nThe research recently appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, in an article edited by Arieh Warshel, Ph.D., of the University of Southern California. Warshel and two other chemists received the 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing multiscale models for complex chemical systems, the same techniques that were used in conducting the BGSU study, \"Comparison of the isomerization mechanisms of human melanopsin and invertebrate and vertebrate rhodopsins.\"\n\n\"The retina of vertebrate eyes, including those of humans, is the most powerful light detector that we know,\" explains Massimo Olivucci, Ph.D., a research professor of Chemistry and director of LCPP in the Center for Photochemical Sciences at BGSU. \"In the human eye, light coming through the lens is projected onto the retina where it forms an image on a mosaic of photoreceptor cells that transmits information from the surrounding environment to the brain's visual cortex. In extremely poor illumination conditions, such as those of a star-studded night or ocean depths, the retina is able to perceiv e intensities corresponding to only a few photons, which are indivisible units of light. Such extreme sensitivity is due to specialized photoreceptor cells containing a light sensitive pigment called rhodopsin.\"\n\nFor a long time, it was assumed that the human retina contained only photoreceptor cells specialized in dim-light and daylight vision, according to Olivucci. However, recent studies revealed the existence of a small number of intrinsically photosensitive nervous cells that regulate non-visual light responses. These cells contain a rhodopsin-like protein named melanopsin, which plays a role in the regulation of unconscious visual reflexes and in the synchronization of the body's responses to the dawn/dusk cycle, known as circadian rhythms or the \"body clock,\" through a process known as photoentrainment.\n\nThe fact that the melanopsin density in the vertebrate retina is 10,000 times lower than that of rhodopsin density, and that, with respect to the visual photoreceptors, the melanopsin-containing cells capture a million-fold fewer photons, suggests that melanopsin may be more sensitive than rhodopsin. The comprehension of the mechanism that makes this extreme light sensitivity possible appears to be a prerequisite to the development of new technologies.\n\nBoth rhodopsin and melanopsin are proteins containing a derivative of vitamin A, which serves as an \"antenna\" for photon detection. When a photon is detected, the proteins are set in an activated state, through a photochemical transformation, which ultimately results in a signal being sent to the brain. Thus, at the molecular level, visual sensitivity is the result of a trade-off between two factors: light activation and thermal noise. It is currently thought that light-activation efficiency (i.e., the number of activation events relative to the total number of detected photons) may be related to its underlying speed of chemical transformation. On the other hand, the thermal noise depends on the number of activation events triggered by ambient body heat in the absence of photon detection.\n\n\"Understanding the mechanism that determines this seemingly amazing light sensitivity of melanopsin may open up new pathways in studying the evolution of light receptors in vertebrate and, in turn, the molecular basis of diseases, such as \"seasonal affecting disorders,\" Olivucci said. \"Moreover, it provides a model for developing sub-nanoscale sensors approaching the sensitivity of a single-photon.\"\n\nFor this reason, the LCPP group \u2013 working together with Francesca Fanelli, Ph.D., of Italy's Universit\u00e0 di Modena e Reggio Emilia"}

They are looking for some insight into what is going on and why the country is at the brink of bankruptcy. I suppose they think my heritage makes me more qualified to offer such insight.\n\nThe Greek crisis in many ways is a simple story; the predictable outcome of policies and cultural idiosyncrasies. So here is an attempt to tell the story with a few charts:\n\n1. Define it. Why is Greece in trouble?\n\n\n2. Did Greece get in trouble because Greeks don't work hard (\"you know, with those long siestas over lunch\"), kind of like the Germans? No.\n\n3. So, if the Greeks work so hard, how come they don't produce enough to cover their obligations?\n\n4. Why is productivity so low? Over the years, politicians have grown the size of government. They also love to regulate. Over the last 30 years they have passed 4,000 new laws and issued about 110,000 ministerial directives. You need a lot of people to enforce these laws. Public servants in Greece get lifetime tenure!! Politicians loved growing the government to curry favor with voters.\n\n5. At the same time, Greeks love to strike to fight for more benefits. Politicians were happy to offer more.\n\n6. Speaking of state favoritism, how about corruption in general? Greece ranks at the bottom within the EU.\n\n7. On top of that, on average Greeks retire earlier\u2026\n\n8. And thus have a higher dependency support ratio (ratio of number of people aged over 65 plus kids up to 15 per 100 persons of working age between 15\u201365). In reality, this significantly underestimates the true dependency ratio, since the country suffers from high rates of youth unemployment and many people retire before the age of 65. In other words, too many people depend for their livelihood on the too few who work.\n\n9. At the same time, the government is not bringing in enough revenues. How do we know this? Greece has the largest \u2013 as percentage of the economy \u2013 shadow or underground economy.\n\n10. How can they escape taxes? Most of the people work for tiny businesses who conduct private cash transactions that can more easily be hidden.\n\n11. And by the way, the number of those businesses in going down\u2026\n\n12. While the VAT taxes remain high relative to others in Europe\u2026\n\n13. So, to sum it up Greece doesn't seem to be a great place to do business.\n\n14. How bad? One group ranks the country 130th in the world\u2026\n\n15. OK, so catch me up. What has happened to date?\n\n16. Has Greece actually accomplished anything during this process? Greece actually grew during the first 3 quarters of 2014.\n\n17. Say, what happened in Q4 of 2014? Looking at Chart 15 you might appreciate why Greeks were fed up with ongoing non-stop austerity measures. So they decided to elect a radical left coalition party that promised to undo the former policies. However, it seems consumers don't have much confidence that the new leftist government will be able to reach an agreement with its eurozone partners.\n\n18. As fears also grew among investors, the cost of borrowing from the markets spiked\u2026\n\n19 a. What does Greece need to do? Here is a list of policy recommendations from OECD for sustainable recovery, similar to the spirit of the reforms proposed by Greece's EU partners.\n\n19 b. To date, the Syriza government has not shown any signs of agreement with the eurozone partners, choosing instead to comply with campaign promises of undoing many reforms by the prior government. Some in the left coalition government are openly advocating a default, exit from the Euro and return to the drachma. In fact, there are some economists who say this would be best for Greece as it would enable it to become competitive in global markets. While good in theory in an open well-functioning economy, the first time Greece elected a socialist government that followed similar policies, the drachma had quite a ride, downwards\u2026\n\n20. In this era of uncertainty, businesses and investors have postponed investments and reversed economic growth, prompting the European Commission to slash growth estimates.\n\nAt this point, the future is indeed uncertain. Will the Syriza government agree to EU/IMF conditions for further loans and implement the program or choose to gamble with an exit from the Euro? We are days or weeks away from finding out.\n\n*Thanasis Delistathis is the founder and managing partner of New Atlantic Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm based in the Washington DC Metropolitan Region and Cambridge, Massachusetts.

{"id": 480, "ended": true, "length": 929, "text": "AFL Players Association chief Paul Marsh admitted the players' union had already planned end-of-season talks with head office, although stressed what most clubs had confirmed \u2013 that the players have not questioned their earnings. Having attempted to set a minimum player wage of $5000 for the eight-week pre-season followed by the eight-week season, the AFL late last year negotiated a new set minimum with the AFLPA of $8500, to be increased to $9700 in 2018. If the above suggests the league did not see this success coming so quickly, it is also worth recalling that the AFL tried to schedule its first women's game at Collingwood's training ground \u2013 the old Olympic Park \u2013 and finished up apologising to thousands of fans unable to squeeze into Carlton's Ikon Park, where almost 25,000 attended. Although the women's contracts are proportionately paltry when measured against TV ratings, the clubs fielding the eight women's teams continue to marvel at how enthusiastic their players have been to promote their sport compared with their male counterparts. In short, club officials are not used to footballers showing their appreciation. Several Brisbane Lions AFLW players cried when they were handed new football boots along with a set of runners and like those overstretched AFL staffers working long hours to put on the games, Marsh said players understood they were all working overtime together to achieve a common purpose.\n\n\"We've agreed to a standard playing contract for two years in good faith,\" said Marsh, \"and they [the AFL] could hold us to that, but we've already flagged we want to have a conversation with them and they've agreed. \"What we're seeing is eight teams and eight sets of players who all want to do more. They are contracted to work for nine hours a week in terms of training and other appearances and they're all doing more and they have no complaints about that. From our perspective there's scope to have conversations with the AFL where we look at that for next year.\" The AFL refused to speculate on a new women's media deal, saying it was too soon to measure the TV success just two rounds in, but would not rule out rewriting the agreement. How could it not on the figures to date? The Western Bulldogs' victory over Fremantle two weeks ago was the top-rating program in Melbourne that week, defeating My Kitchen Rules in a result that astonished the Seven Network. On market value, broadcasters and the AFL agree a prime-time women's game is worth the same as Seven's Saturday night winter AFL game. This is because Saturday night telecasts of AFLW have, in their infancy, rated as well as their male AFL equivalents, and on many comparisons better. On pay TV, Fox reports that the competition has quadrupled its male A-League numbers. In ratings terms, the women Australian rules footballers' wages look embarrassing when compared with the soccer men.\n\nOn every measure that counts, the AFL should be laughing all the way to the bank. As should its new breed of players. Except that they're not, because the competition gave away the broadcast rights for free to Channel Seven and Foxtel on a two-year goodwill agreement. At one point the two parties even haggled over the production costs although in the end the networks picked up the tab, outsourcing the production of all games to Eddie McGuire's McGuire Media. An agreement which only weeks ago appeared as if its broadcasters were doing the AFL a favour now presents as a bargain of the highest order. The decision to allow spectators to attend free has introduced new supporters to football, according to head office, and is likely to continue next season. New corporate partners such as Chemist Warehouse and Cotton On \u2013 supporting the women until at least the end of 2019 with a further three-year option \u2013 would not have come aboard the AFL without the women. The competition was disappointed Sydney failed to bid for a licence but the consequence is that GWS has signed more AFLW members (2000 at $60 each) and introduced new major sponsors to the club in Harvey Norman and Sydney Airport. Never have the Giants, still battling for recognition, received so much pre-season publicity. The short-term decisions facing the competition include where and when to hold the AFLW version of the Brownlow and whether to schedule a Melbourne grand final at the MCG or Ikon Park. But those appear insignificant compared with the looming review into how to handle the next phase of the AFLW - a competition launched in haste by impatient CEO Gillon McLachlan, but one that will surely prove his greatest legacy."}

Meanwhile, 13 percent openly supported \"intelligent design\" in the classroom, and 60 percent fell somewhere in-between. This majority presented evolution cautiouslyby including non-scientific viewpoints, by limiting discussion to genetics, or by saying that students only needed to learn the material to pass exams.\n\nWhat do you think about this?\n\n\nBill Nye, Executive Director of the Planetary Society: It's horrible. Science is the key to our future, and if you don't believe in science, then you're holding everybody back.

It's wanting the world to be different than it is. And if you don't want the world to be different you are an unusual human being. We all want the world to be different. But to deny evolution is in no one's best interest.\n\nDo you think there's anything that can be done about it?\n\n\nWell the longest journey starts with just a single step. Science education: We should support it. Especially elementary school science. Nearly every rocket scientist got interested in it before they were 10. Everybody who's a physician, who makes vaccines, who wants to find the cure for cancer. Everybody who wants to do any medical good for humankind got the passion for that before he or she was 10. So we want to excite a new generation of kidsevery generationabout the passion, beauty and joythe PB&Jof science. These anti-evolution people are frustrating in two ways. The first way is, almost certainly they know better. Those people really do believe in flu shots. They really do understand that when you find fossil bones of ancient dinosaurs, you are looking at deep time, not just 5000 years. And secondly, and much more importantly, having raised a generation of kids who don't understand science is bad for everyone. And with the United States having a leadership role in science and technology, having a generation of kids not believing in science is bad for the world.\n\nIs there a funding issue? Is that why the teachers aren't teaching it correctly?\n\n\nOh the teachers get pulled every which way. People get on school boards just with this agenda of not teaching evolution. The school board comes running in and beats them over the head. But denying the facts does not make them not true. And in science we're always looking for the truth, it's what we do. Does this work? Does this solve the problem? Can you do the same experiment and get the same results?\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nShould teachers be mandated to teach evolution as fact?\n\n\nWhat other fundamental theory in all of biology is there? Intelligent design, as the judge in Dover, Penn., said, is \"breathtaking inanity.\" It was so stupid it took his breath away. I agree with him. It's great to teach in history class, though. People believed the earth was the center of the universe. People believed the earth was flat. It was reasonable at the time, but we don't learn about those ideas in science class.\n\nSo do you think those biology teachers are simply teaching their own beliefs, or are they under outside pressure?\n\n\nThey're doing their job but they're under tremendous pressure. The 60 percent who are cautiousthose are the people who are really up against it. They want to keep their job, and they love teaching science, and their children are really excited about it, and yet they've got some people insisting they can't teach the most fundamental idea in all of biology. There's the phrase \"just a theory.\" Which shows you that I have failed. I'm a failure. When we have a theory in science, it's the greatest thing you can have. Relativity is a theory, and people test it every which way. They test it and test it and test it. Gravity is a theory. People have landed spacecraft on the moon within a few feet of accuracy because we understand gravity so well. People make flu vaccinations that stop people from getting sick. Farmers raise crops with science; they hybridize them and make them better with every generation. That's all evolution. Evolution is a theory, and it's a theory that you can test. We've tested evolution in many ways. You can't present good evidence that says evolution is not a fact."}

Then you just sit there and listen and do whatever mischief you want to.\".\n\nThe Diebold intrusion was simpler than the Sequoia hack, which required his team to program the man-in the middle component to get the machine to alert users that their votes had been cast as well as changing the selection, he said.\n\n\"[The latest hack] was ridiculously easy. We just had to control the information coming in from the voter. If you send the computer the wrong candidate it simply assumes the data that is being sent is what the voter meant,\" Johnston said.\n\nAnd \"we could easily tamper with the printer output where the paper record would match what was stored electronically,\" he added.\n\nJohnston described the microprocessor and the other electronic parts used in the experiment as the sort that can be easily purchased at hobby stores or online. The chip could be programmed by people with only rudimentary skills, he noted.\n\n\"We wanted people not to get so hung up on cyber vulnerabilities,\" and consider other threats as well, he said.\n\nVoting systems are often left unguarded when they are not in use or while in transit and can easily be tampered without anyone knowing about it, he added.\n\nThe Diebold Accuvote TS is a direct recording electronic voting (DRE) machine, a type that has long drawn flak because it offers no verifiable paper record. Some experts also consider them unreliable, too hard to audit and prone to all sorts of tampering.\n\nSupporters of DRE systems insist that such concerns are overblown.\n\nAccording to statistics maintained by election watchdog Verified Voting, several states, including Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey and South Carolina currently use DREs without auditable paper trails.\n\nSeveral other states, including Indiana, Pennsylvania, Texas, Tennessee and Virginia, use a combination of paperless DREs as well as paper ballots -- 32 states and the District of Columbia have laws that require DREs to be used only with verifiable paper records.\n\nPamela Smith, president of Verified Voting, said that the successful hack by Johnston's team is not surprising.\n\n\"On"}

Normally, he wouldn't be willing to let others use him in such a manner, yet he also understood the terrifying level the Metals professor and Fanu had reached! Yet, in the previous world, the one that caused the death of the Metals professor and Fanu and survived, was this man called Seaman \u2013 the Seaman who had an innate defensive ability!\n\nThis cruel reality further established Mogensha's belief \u2013 This person must be made a friend, and not the enemy!\n\nAfter putting to rest his thoughts, Mogensha coughed loudly and attracted the attention of everyone else. He raised his voice.\n\n\"I am the golden AK user, Mogensha. Everyone probably have heard of my name before right? Is there anyone able to attack the two beasts outside?\"\n\nAfter he issued the statement, at least 5-6 others displayed an astonished expression, beginning whispering in each others ears. Seated in front of him, a male wearing a leather jacket frowned.\n\n\"I can, but firstly It isn't enough to kill them, and I feel there isn't a need to. Let the other transport ship distract them, wouldn't it be better? This will secure our safe landing.\"\n\nMogensha laughed coldly, and ignored him. Opposite, a female very resolutely offered.\n\n\"I reckon I can communicate with the pilot first. If there is a need to retaliate, then we would definitely do so. But first I need to know the reason.\"\n\nObviously this woman's prime ability should be her charm, but naturally she didn't receive a resolute answer \u2013 because Mogensha himself did not understand what Sheyan was coming at. But Mogensha understood one thing, and that was Sheyan wished to attack the pursuing twin beasts a the back. If he couldn't even accomplish the first request of Seaman, then his personal worth would no doubt decrease.\n\nMogensha acted decisively, drawing out his golden AK and aimed towards the 3 safety straps before releasing fire. He then reach out for the metal safety belt and exerted force lightly. A piercing metal cranking sound resounded, as he pulled off the metal safety straps that were binding him; finally standing up.\n\n\"What are you trying to do!\" Several stunned voices probed out. Disregarding them, Mogensha directly strode towards the little shuttle at the pilot cabin; releasing a robotic yet frustrated tone.\n\n\"Hoi! Mate in front. The two alien freaks have already annihilated at least 20 of our bros, and they look like they're about to succeed again. Are we just gonna stay here stupidly?\"\n\nThe pilot snarled back.\n\n\"Do you think I don't want to wreck their ass? F***, I swear on my son's baseball cap. If this was a Valkyrie (anti-fighter spacecraft), then I would serve these two spore wyverns a taste of 8 rounds of H.A.L.O (High Altitude Long Operating) cluster rockets! But this is a bloody transport shuttle, although it is a specially enforced transport shuttle! Rather, you better F***king scram to your seat and buckle up!\"\n\nMogensha shrugged his shoulders dejectedly.\n\n\"Alright, looks like the only thing we can do is pray for them.\"\n\nThe pilot cleared his throat and suddenly issued.\n\n\"Wait wait, I remember while reinforcing this shuttle, that old Nick seemed to have installed a machine cannon. But the shuttle took off before there was time to link it to the firing system. But if you have confidence in yourself, then I can open the firing compartment. Yo still have to operate it manually. Truthfully, I don't suggest you doing that.\"\n\nMogensha exposed a crafty smile.\n\n\"Just wait and watch the show.\"\n\nThe pilot extended a thumbs up without turning to him. Pressing somewhere, a long drawn out 'Chi' sound emitted from the ceiling rampart. Another pilot chair rotated as it descended. Mogensha arrogantly took his seat, and ascended with the chair. The male in the leather jacket looked on disapprovingly, yet he didn't dare to voice out. Mogensha's golden AK was a rather impressive deterrent.\n\nIn a flash, illuminated tracer rounds were fired out from the hood of the transportation shuttle; directly piercing the body of a predatory spore wyvern. The unprepared spore wyvern immediately lost balance and starting rolling in mid space, screeching out in agony. Huge greenish sticky fluid gushed out from its"}

I had a new 2G Prius in for PDI and decided to give it a try. And guess what,I found out what we were doing wrong! Just one little step messes up everything. Here is the steps from the TSB and only applies to the 2G.1. Park the vehicle so as it is level,front to back and side to side.2. IgOn and make sure that \"Trip A \" is showing on the odo ( this is where we made a mistake).3. Power down.4. Keep your foot off the brake.5. Push in and hold down the Odo/Trip button.6. Push the Power button twice to IgOn ( not Ready mode ).7. Turn the Odo/Trip off then On 3 times in 5 seconds.8. Continue holding the Odo/Trip button until a 6 digit code appears.9. Release,then push again the Odo/Trip button for another 5 seconds. The 6 digit code will change to a 5 digit code.10. After the middle digit,of the 5 digit code,changes to \"1\" release the Odo/Trip button and the odometer will return to normal reading.Hope this clarifies the steps."}

A transcript has been released of the original Raiders of the Lost Ark story conference among Lucas, Spielberg and Kasdan. Here's a segment, which I've trimmed slightly for relevance to the kind of stuff we discuss here. G = George Lucas, S = Steven Spielberg, L = Lawrence Kasdan.\n\nFor a while, they weren't sure what kind of girl to have as a counterpart to Indy\u2026\n\nThere was talk about a big name professor who taught Indy everything he knew. Then there was the idea about this German girl, and for the sake of expediency, Kasdan suggested that Indy instead have an affair with the mentor's daughter, which they loved. And then Lucas and Spielberg were off and running with ideas about how's she's been left in Peru and has this bar and is trying to get money together to get back to the States and loves (and resents) Indy to no end. In fact, Kasdan said he wanted Indy and this girl to already have a history when they meet because, \"I like it if they already had a relationship at one point. Because then you don't have to build it.\" Hehehe\u2026\n\nThen the discussion turned to how old Marion and Indy were at the time of the affair:\n\nG \u2014 I was thinking that this old guy could have been his mentor. He could have known this little girl when she was just a kid. Had an affair with her when she was eleven.\n\nL \u2014 And he was forty-two.\n\nG \u2014 He hasn't seen her in twelve years. Now she's twenty-two. It's a real strange relationship.\n\nS \u2014 She had better be older than twenty-two.\n\nG \u2014 He's thirty-five, and he knew her ten years ago when he was twenty-five and she was only twelve. It would be amusing to make her slightly young at the time.\n\nS \u2014 And promiscuous. She came onto him.\n\nG \u2014 Fifteen is right on the edge. I know it's an outrageous idea, but it is interesting. Once she's sixteen or seventeen it's not interesting anymore. But if she was fifteen and he was twenty-five and they actually had an affair the last time they met. And she was madly in love with him and he\u2026\n\nS \u2014 She has pictures of him.\n\nAnd now consider the dialog of that scene in the film.\n\nINDY: I never meant to hurt you.\n\nMARION: I was a child! I was in love.\n\nINDY: You knew what you were doing.\n\nMARION: It was wrong. You knew it.\n\nINDY: Look, I did what I did. I don't expect you to be happy about it. But maybe we can do each other some good.\n\nMARION: Why start now?\n\nINDY: Shut up and listen for a second. I want that piece your father had. I've got money.\n\nMARION: How much?"}

Rape is a serious issue and if the accused did rape her then he deserves to be punished, but there needs to be evidence that it happened.

Well-written copy follows these simple guidelines.\n\nFebruary 16, 2009 14 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThis article has been excerpted from Kick-Ass Copywriting in 10 Easy Steps by Susan Gunelius, available from Entrepreneur Press .\n\nWhether you're a small-business owner, a medium-size business owner, an eBay seller, or simply trying to break into the copywriting industry, understanding the fundamentals of writing sales-oriented copy and put you on a path to success. At its core, copywriting is another device in a business' marketing toolbox. Well-written copy can make or break an ad or marketing piece. With that in mind, copywriting can equate to either well-spent advertising investments or a waste of advertising dollars.\n\nMany people misinterpret the uniqueness of effective copywriting. I can't count the number of times I've heard freelance writers say they want to shift from article writing to copywriting as if it's simply an extension of their existing abilities. Copywriting does come naturally to some people, but for most, it's a foreign landscape they do not know how to navigate. Copywriting is about more than writing the hard sell sales letter that many short copywriting courses offer. In fact, I cringe when I see those over-the-top sales letters, which do little more than provide an ugly representation of copywriting, sales and marketing.\n\n\nWell-crafted copywriting doesn't need to beat a person over the head. It doesn't have to drown in bold typeface and capitalization. The message should stand on its own without an overabundance of heavy-handed sales language and design embellishments. I associate many sales letters that are guilty of this technique with a writer who doesn't truly understand the basic purpose of copywriting. However, successful copywriting can be achieved in 10 easy steps.\n\nConsider Your Copy Motivate your customer to buy with these 10 copywriting steps: 1. Exploit your product's benefits\n\n\n2. Exploit your competition's weaknesses\n\n\n3. Know your audience\n\n\n4. Communicate W.I.I.F.M. (What's In It For Me?)\n\n\n5. Focus on \"you,\" not \"we\"\n\n\n6. Understand your medium\n\n\n7. Avoid T.M.I. (Too Much Information)\n\n\n8. Include a call to action\n\n\n9. C.Y.A. (Cover Your Ass)\n\n\n10. Proofread\n\n1. Exploit your product's benefits.\n\nThe first step of the copywriting outline is the foundation for your advertising campaigns. A benefit is the value of your product to a customer. In other words, a benefit is what the product can do for a customer or how the product can help a customer. You need to put into words the reasons your product is the best available and better than your competitors' products based on the added value it provides to your customers. The key to success is for you to fully understand all the benefits of your product. Only then can you ensure that the audience knows them and can relate to them.\n\n2. Exploit your competition's weaknesses.\n\nTo write compelling copy, it is essential that you know what differentiates your product from the competition. Once you know your competitors' weaknesses, you must make sure your audience knows them and understands why buying your competitors' products would be a terrible mistake. Get started by thoroughly researching your competition and understanding what they offer in terms of products and services. Next, list the elements of their offerings that are inferior to your own. Feel free to tear the competition apart but be realistic in your comparisons. You want to be able to support your claims if you are challenged.\n\n3. Know your audience.\n\nEvery person in the world is not going to see every ad in the world. Each ad has a specific audience that will see it, and it's the marketer's job to find the best placement to ensure the target audience will see it. For example, an ad for skateboards placed in a local senior citizen housing association newsletter is not likely to generate a lot of sales. In fact, it would be a waste of advertising dollars. The target audience for skateboards is teenagers or young adults. The vast majority of senior citizens do not use skateboards, and it is not a product category in which they typically purchase gifts. Before you buy ad space, make sure you're spending your money in the right place to get the biggest bang for your buck in terms of exposure and building awareness of your product or service.\n\nFirst, take the time to research your customers thoroughly. In most businesses, 20 percent of customers are responsible for 80 percent of sales (this is called the 80/20 rule in case you're curious about the official marketing terminology for this phenomenon). That 20"}

It Might Also Be A Solution\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Asma Khalid/WBUR Asma Khalid/WBUR\n\nAlison Lu was in shock on election night. The Harvard Business School student had voted for Hillary Clinton, and she couldn't fathom how Donald Trump had managed to win the presidency.\n\nShe opened her Facebook page searching for answers, but she didn't find any Trump-supporting friends. \"None of them [Trump voters] showed themselves on my Facebook feed,\" she says.\n\nLu, like many Americans, was living in a self-selected social media world of like-minded people. The Pew Research Center has found that about two-thirds of adults get news from social media. Analysts have blamed technology for creating an online echo chamber.\n\nBut if technology created this problem, can it also help fix it? That's the question the tech industry, including a couple of entrepreneurs and researchers, is trying to answer.\n\nConnecting to find civil offline conversation\n\nHenry Tsai had worked in Silicon Valley for the past few years before coming to Harvard Business School.\n\n\"The day after the election, it was clear that discourse in this country was maybe not where we want it to be,\" Tsai says. \"There's a lot of either demonizing or dismissiveness.\"\n\nHe had this idea of bringing people together from opposing political views. In a burst of late-night inspiration, along with some help from a friend studying computer science at MIT, he created Hi From The Other Side.\n\nThe goal is to take two people from different sides of the political spectrum \u2014 a Donald Trump supporter and a Hillary Clinton supporter \u2014 match them up, introduce them and allow them to talk to each other in real life.\n\n\"It's not only to bring people together, but, more importantly, bringing them together in a way that's productive or civil,\" Tsai says.\n\nAnd that's exactly what Lu wanted as she tried to make sense of things after the election. \"At that time, there was a general sense of helplessness on my end,\" she says. \"I just wanted to do something to try to help me just understand.\"\n\nLu, 27, was one of the first Hi From The Other Side users. She was matched up with Dennis O'Brien, a 26-year-old in New Hampshire working in IT security.\n\nO'Brien had voted for Trump, in part, because he hates the Affordable Care Act \u2014 also known as Obamacare.\n\nBut after the election, he remembers seeing young women crying. \"All these people were legitimately terrified,\" he says. \"And, I couldn't quite wrap my mind around why.\"\n\nThe next day, he saw a blurb about Hi From The Other Side on Facebook, and he clicked on it. O'Brien figured \"what the heck\" \u2014 he could meet someone new and learn what's going through that person's mind. Think of it as going on a blind date to talk politics.\n\nLu and O'Brien were introduced to each other over email and agreed to meet up in person on a Tuesday night at a burger place in Cambridge.\n\n\"We were there for like two hours,\" O'Brien recalls.\n\nO'Brien didn't know what to expect.\n\n\"I was really hoping that I just wouldn't get an extremist to talk to, someone who's like 'Hillary or death,' \" he says.\n\nBut luckily, he says, Lu \"wasn't crazy.\"\n\n\"There was never a moment where I felt stupid or I felt like I was an idiot, and likewise, toward her \u2014 I never thought she was anything more than a normal person,\" O'Brien says.\n\nLu laughed and recalled her first impression of meeting O'Brien.\n\n\"He's not like a racist, bigoted [person] like I think the stereotype of some Trump supporters are,\" she says. \"I think what helped was also we were able to find a little bit of common ground.\"\n\nThe two found a bit of common ground on climate change.

The things we \"own\" often remain the property of the manufacturers, at least in part. That's the trade-off we never asked for -- one pushed on us by everyone from movie studios to makers of high-end cat litter boxes and coffee brewers. DRM prevents backup copies. Proprietary packets brick functions until manufacturer-approved refills are in place.\n\n\nHere's another bit of ridiculousness, via Techdirt reader techflaws. German news outlet c't Magazin is reporting that Xerox printers are going further than the normal restrictions we've become accustomed to. For years, printer companies have made sure users' printers won't run without every single slot being filled with approved cartridges. This includes such stupidity as disabling every function (including non-ink-related functions like scanning) in all-in-one printers until the printer is fed.\n\n\nXerox is going further. Not only do you need to refill the ink, but you have to fill it with local ink. techflaws paraphrases the paywalled, German-language article.\n\nXerox uses region coding on their toner catridges AND locks the printer to the first type used. So if you use an NA (North America) catridge you can't use the cheaper DMO (Eastern Europe) anymore. The printer's display does NOT show this, nor does the hotline know about it. When c't reached out to Xerox, the marketing drone claimed, this was done to serve the customer better, I kid you not.\n\nI have seen hundreds of posts regarding the rejection of ink based on the location of purchase. I asume that Xerox does this to prevent the purchase of ink not manufactured by them. However - forcing a client to pay for a service for a snippet that needs to be installed in order to use the printer is ABSURD.\n\n\nI changed from HP to Xerox because I thought it was a trusted name. I have instead learned that in the process of trying to protect against counterfeit - it is the paying customer that will get a non-functioning printer - with no help unless you are willing to pay for the printer to work as it should have to begin with.\n\nAs I live in the UK my ink blocks are for the European market. If I purchase from ebay, ink blocks for the USA or Asian market and insert them into my printer, the printer will stop with a contact your engineer code on the LCD. The printer is now unusable.\n\nreceive only the best customer service\n\nLooks like the printer cartridge manufacturers will be borrowing techniques from Hollywood. HP introduced region coding for some of the newest printers sold in Europe. HP's US location and US dollar sliding lead to the situation, where cartridge prices in Europe are significantly higher than those in the States. In the Wall Street Journal article HP representative in Europe claims the company doesn't make any money off regional coding for cartridges, and that consumers will win once the US dollar rises over Euro.\n\nAh, the old \"serve the customer better by limiting his/her options,\" as seen everywhere DRM/DRM-esque restrictions are applied.But while c't Magazin has only recently stumbled across this issue of region-locked ink cartridges, it's by no means aissue. Techflaws also points to a 2011 forum post by a user who ran into this problem with his Xerox printer.So, it appears that if you attempt to forcefeed a Xerox printer not-from-around-here ink, it will potentially brick the device. At that point, you're forced to ask for a Xerox rep to drop by and unlock your purchased printer for you. Here's another confirmation of Xerox's \"locals only\" ink limitations The rate charged to the person in the forum post quoted above was $596/hour. There's no missing decimal point there. Sure, it's only 10 minutes of work, but it's $60 being shelled out by a paying customer just so his printer will go back to printing. The only thing actually \"broken\" is Xerox's business model.This person notes they switched from HP to Xerox because the latter was supposedly more trustworthy. Apparently not. Printers aren't a business. They're a racket. HP is no better than Xerox. It too will lock your printer to a certain region to ensure youpurchase only most profitable ink cartridges.If dates are anything to go by, HP likely pioneered the bullshit that is region-locked ink. This is from a 2005 Slashdot post . (The internal link to the Wall Street Journal is dead, so it has been omitted.)Unbelievably, the rep says customers will \"win\" if an aspect HP can't control (currency exchange rates) happens to shift in the customers' favor. Why not just say consumers will be better off if those scratch tickets are winners? Or if the housing market rebounds"}

The article talks about the fate of Tawergha, a small town 25 miles to the south of Misrata, inhabited mostly by black Libyans, a legacy of its 19th-century origins as a transit town in the slave trade:\n\nIbrahim al-Halbous, a rebel commander leading the fight near Tawergha, says all remaining residents should leave once if his fighters capture the town. \"They should pack up,\" Mr. Halbous said. \"Tawergha no longer exists, only Misrata.\"\n\nOther rebel leaders are reported as:\n\n\"calling for drastic measures like banning Tawergha natives from ever working, living or sending their children to schools in Misrata.\"\n\nIn addition, according to the article, as a result of the battle for Misrata:\n\nnearly four-fifths of residents of Misrata's Ghoushi neighborhood were Tawergha natives. Now they are gone or in hiding, fearing revenge attacks by Misratans, amid reports of bounties for their capture.\n\nAmid allegations of black mercenaries and stories of mass rape by the inhabitants of Tawergha, Sam Dagher reports on further evidence of the racism amongst the rebel forces:\n\nSome of the hatred of Tawergha has racist overtones that were mostly latent before the current conflict. On the road between Misrata and Tawergha, rebel slogans like \"the brigade for purging slaves, black skin\" have supplanted pro-Gadhafi scrawl.\n\nThe racial tensions have been fueled by the regime's alleged use of African mercenaries to violently suppress demonstrators at the start of the Libyan uprising in February, and the sense that the south of the country, which is predominantly black, mainly backs Col. Gadhafi.\n\nThis information has already been publicised, in the WSJ and also in the Black Star News. Bryan Chan of the Los Angeles Times reports visiting a prison in Benghazi, where terrified black men were paraded for the cameras (with Human Rights Watch silently taking notes). One man bravely protested he was just a guest worker and the guards presented a Gambian passport as proof he was a Gaddafi operative. Chan's Libyan interpreter asked:\n\n\"So what do you think? Should we just go ahead and kill them?\"\n\nThere is a lot of horrific video footage clearly showing public lynchings in Benghazi (link to graphic description of some of the footage). including at the rebel HQ, beheadings of blindfolded prisoners and interrogation of prisoners, including in hospitals.\n\nThe myth of black mercenaries leads to lynchings\n\nOther evidence of the massacres of black people, which include the lynchings and murder of black soldiers of the Libyan army, guest workers from other African countries and dark-skinned Libyan civilians include a report from the BBC on 25 February which cited a Turkish construction worker as saying:\n\n\"We had 70-80 people from Chad working for our company. They were cut dead with pruning shears and axes, attackers saying: 'You are providing troops for Gaddafi.' The Sudanese were also massacred. We saw it for ourselves.\"\n\nOn 27th February Nick Meo of The Telegraph reported from Al-Bayda that he had been shown mobile phone footage of a 'captured mercenary' (presumably he means black person with a uniform) lynched from a street lamp as well as a 'black African hanging on a meat hook.'\n\nAmnesty International crisis researcher, Donatella Rovera spent the period from 27 February to 29th May in Misrata, Benghasi, Ajabiya and Ras Lanouf. Yesterday she was interviewed by Austria's 'The Standard' and had this to say on the subject:\n\n\"We examined this issue in depth and found no evidence. The rebels spread these rumours everywhere, which had terrible consequences for African guest workers: there was a systematic hunt for migrants, some were lynched and many arrested. Since then, even the rebels have admitted there were no mercenaries, almost all have been released and have returned to their countries of origin, as the investigations into them revealed nothing.\"\n\nWho spread the myth and why?\n\nSo what accounts for the widespread popularity of this myth? It is, to be frank, an example of highly successful propaganda, appealing to the basest of racial stereotypes. The myth was highly important in gaining consent for the operation in Libya, in order to cover up and justify the massacres of black"}

It's been used for centuries in Chinese medicine to restore health for a variety of conditions.\n\nTraditional Chinese acupuncture is based on the theory that illness can result when the body's flow of energy (called \"chi\" or \"qi\") is blocked or imbalanced. The acupuncture needles are positioned to correct those problems.\n\nWestern medical practitioners have become interested in acupuncture, especially for pain relief. However, they often view acupuncture differently from their peers in traditional Chinese medicine, focusing on its biochemical effects instead of energy flow.\n\nSince acupuncture has been noted for pain relief, University of Maryland researchers decided to test it on people with knee osteoarthritis.\n\nOsteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, involves the breakdown of joint cartilage and affects an estimated 21 million people in the U.S., according to the American College of Rheumatology.\n\nThe new study enrolled 570 people with knee osteoarthritis. They were studied by University of Maryland researchers including medicine professor Marc Hochberg, MD, PhD, who heads the rheumatology and clinical immunology division of the university's medical school in Baltimore, Md.\n\nThe knee osteoarthritis patients were randomly assigned to receive either 23 sessions of traditional Chinese acupuncture, 23 treatments of sham acupuncture, or a 12-week knee osteoarthritis education course. In the sham acupuncture group, guide tubes were tapped at two points on the abdomen but no actual acupuncture was given.\n\nOsteoarthritis knee pain, function and stiffness were recorded.\n\nParticipants receiving traditional Chinese acupuncture group fared best. At the end of the 26-week study, they had the greatest decrease in knee osteoarthritis pain and the biggest improvement in knee osteoarthritis function.\n\nNo serious side effects were noted in any of the groups.\n\nTraditional Chinese acupuncture is \"effective\" at reducing knee osteoarthritis pain and improving function in people with knee osteoarthritis, say the researchers, who presented their findings in San Antonio at the American College of Rheumatology's annual scientific meeting."}

Of three pieces of footage shown, one was the digital billboard released by 20th Century Fox earlier Thursday (see below), while the second featured a spoiler-filled scene that's currently a work-in-progress, showcasing the work of Serkis and other motion-capture actors in the movie before digital rendering transforms them into photo realistic apes.\n\nReeves and Clark both lauded Serkis' role in creating the Caesar that audiences see on screen in the current Apes movies, with Reeves telling the audience that, before he started work on 2014's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, he watched the 2011 film Rise of the Planet of the Apes in two different formats \u2014 the finished version audiences saw, and a version showing Serkis' performance without CGI effects added. \"I realized, it was all Andy,\" he explained.\n\nSerkis, impressively humble when faced with Reeves and Clark demanding an Academy Award for his performance, joined Reeves in talking about what to expect from next summer's third installment in the series. Serkis lauded the performance of Woody Harrelson as the Colonel, a fanatic leading the final charge for humanity in the war against the apes that will have lasted two years by the time the movie opens. Serkis said that War would push Caesar into a dark place where his empathy with humanity eventually dies.\n\nReeves called War of the Planet of the Apes an epic that takes the series to a \"mythical\" level, promising the audience that it is darker, more action-packed and also funnier than earlier movies.\n\nThe panel finished with the debut of the teaser trailer for the movie, which opens with a failed assassination attempt on Caesar before introducing the Colonel, who talks about the need for humanity to fight back one last time against the rebellion of the apes. The final shot of the trailer is a human army surrounding Caesar as he kneels before the Colonel, with a gun placed against his forehead. To lose the war, the Colonel warns, would mean that the world would \"truly become a planet of apes.\" Nobody tell him what the name of the franchise is, in case he gets demoralized.\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes is set to open July 14, 2017."}

Does WWE instead plan on delaying the unification, ending Tables, Ladders & Chairs 2013 with a non-decisive finish?\n\nThe storyline that ended with the first-ever undisputed champion was a narrative built on rivalries and high stakes and led to one of the most memorable nights in WWE history.\n\nAfter buying out WCW in 2001, WWE had to not only find a way to manage an influx of wrestlers from the rival promotion, but its championships as well. Before that year's Survivor Series, 10 championships were contested in WWE.\n\nSurvivor Series trimmed that number down some with two unification matches, but it wasn't until Vengeance 2001 that the WWE Championship and the title formerly known as the WCW World Heavyweight Championship would become one.\n\nLike with Orton and Cena today, the argument was that there couldn't be two top champions at the same time. Only one king shall rule.\n\nThe Alliance Falls\n\nAfter March of 2001, WCW, in reality, was no more. It was nothing more than a collection of memories and set of archives in WWE's possession. In terms of storyline, though, WCW lived on as a faction.\n\nSurvivor Series' main event would pit members of that faction against WWE Superstars in a traditional elimination tag team match. The winning team would see their company live on; defeat meant dissolution.\n\nThe four men who would later fight for the undisputed title played major roles that night.\n\nKurt Angle and Steve Austin aligned with The Alliance, serving as the two most dominant forces on that team. Jericho and The Rock joined Kane, Big Show and The Undertaker to form Team WWF.\n\nJericho promised to not let his bad blood with The Rock get in the way of Team WWF winning. Hotheaded as he is, though, he broke that promise late in the match.\n\nFrustrated with his temporary partner and upset over being eliminated, Jericho drove The Rock's face to the mat. That emotional flare-up nearly led to Team WWF losing.\n\nThe Rock managed to kick out of Austin's pin attempt and those two long-standing rivals brawled in and around the ring. Neither man was able to keep the other down. It was Angle's betrayal that finally decided the outcome.\n\nIn the heart of chaos created by a WCW referee refusing to count for The Rock and \"Stone Cold\" knocking that same referee to the canvas, Angle darted into the ring and clocked his own partner with a championship belt.\n\nWCW's departure made the WCW world title superfluous.\n\nVince McMahon announced that due to Angle's part in saving WWE, he would give him the WWE Championship. It wouldn't be as simple as that, though. Ric Flair made a power play and booked the now-famous main event for Vengeance.\n\nShane and Stephanie McMahon had sold their stocks in the company to a consortium. Flair, in his trademark, manic delivery announced, \"The consortium was me!\"\n\nFlair had The Rock defend the WCW title against Jericho, Austin defend his WWE Championship against Angle and the two winners would meet in a third match to decide the undisputed champ.\n\nDec. 9, 2001\n\nAustin and The Rock were WWE's biggest stars at the time. It seemed inevitable that those two would be the men in the finals at Vengeance.\n\nEven with many fans believing the first two matches to be predictable, anticipation filled the San Diego Sports Arena that night.\n\nOne wrestler would make WWE history. Two championships would merge into one.\n\nAustin and Angle went at it first. The tension that the ending of Survivor Series created only added to a run of animosity between them.\n\nEarlier in the year, they had headlined three straight pay-per-views as opponents, from SummerSlam to No Mercy.\n\nThat contentious past led to an intense showdown at Vengeance. Austin damaged Angle's arm, and Angle slammed Austin's leg against the ring post.\n\nThe Angle Slam wasn't enough to put Austin away. Austin's Stunner proved to be decisive, though. Austin retained his title, keeping the possibility of the marquee matchup against The Rock alive.\n\nJericho's battle with The Rock was the best match of the night. The action was aided by bad blood as well.\n\nThe Rock was Jericho's first WWE antagonist, being there for Y2J's memorable debut.\n\nDespite being successful tag team partners, those two spent much of 2001 colliding over the WCW title. Jericho won it from The Rock at No Mercy thanks to hitting him with Breakdown onto a steel chair.\n\nAt Vengeance, with the chance to face Austin as"}

I experienced something similar when the Jennifer Aniston style became popular but that surge built slowly - this has come completely out of the blue.'\n\nThatcher's famous hairstyle originated in Chalmer's salon in Mayfair during the early 1970s.\n\nThe Iron Lady's first modern look was adapted slightly as she aged but the cut never lost its unique power.\n\n'I decided to recreate the early look on one of my actress clients,' reveals Mr Centini.\n\n'It blossomed from there. The cut looked striking on her, other models and actresses that she knows were soon calling asking for the 'Thatcher'. At first I found it amusing but now the domino effect has become serious, the demand is too much to cope with.'\n\n'I immediately fell in love with the cut,' said the actress.\n\n'It is the perfect mix of feminine style with a hint of masculine power. I think for a modern woman that is now an ideal balance. When my other model and actress friends saw it they were immediately intrigued. I have been turning a lot of heads.'\n\nMargaret Thatcher's powerful image - steely and professional, yet always feminine - was a key part of her status.\n\nHowever, few women replicated the look during her time in office. Now, in a time perhaps of greater equality, women have happily embraced the look.\n\nMaggie tributes: The former Prime Minister's famous hairstyle is now requested in salons as women want to copy 'The Thatcher'\n\nThe impact has now echoed into Hollywood. Sharon Stone caused a stir at the weekend when she arrived at the White House sporting a 'power statement' style.\n\nHer famous blonde hair was swept tightly to her head, adopting the same lines as the 'Thatcher'. Her look at the Obama hosted event made headlines across the world.\n\nItalian-born Christina Bellucci, 37, a digital consultant, said she felt the look reflected a modern attitude.\n\n'This is a strong style and gives me authority,' she said.\n\n'When I walk out the door I feel a few inches taller, it gives me power without sacrificing any of my femininity.'\n\n'We've done over seventy of the styles since the news broke of Margaret's death,' reveals Centini.\n\nThis lady is not for turning! From her days running the country to her later years, Margaret Thatcher's hairstyle never changed\n\n'It is a steady flow at the moment. What I like is that women are using it to give their lives and general attitudes a boost, many of them tell me that they step out of the chair with more confidence.\n\nIt started with younger girls adopting the style - now they have started sending their mums in! What I find interesting is that every women will have a different image of Thatcher in their mind depending on their age.'\n\nAchieving the look is initially a complicated process. 'Margaret Thatcher paid a surprising amount of attention to her style,' says Centini.\n\nHolly Carpenter, a 32-year-old mum of two, said she appreciated the style's practicality. 'She was a busy lady, and so am I. Once the cut is done, the 'Thatcher' is quick and easy to knock into place and I can run out the door.'\n\nCelebrity clients of the salon range from Sophie Dahl to the 'Made in Chelsea' stars; we may be seeing 'The Thatcher' on our screens soon."}

(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) ended a month-long holdout by formally backing his party's presumptive presidential nominee: Donald Trump.\n\nOn Thursday, the speaker penned a guest column for his hometown newspaper in which he trumpeted the controversial real-estate mogul as someone who could support the speaker's conservative agenda. The move consolidated Trump's backing from Republican congressional leaders and most party leaders, leaving a small-but-influential bloc of conservatives who have vowed to never support the real-estate mogul isolated and without a significant leader carrying their flag.\n\nLike many senior Republicans, Ryan's endorsement came with its share of caveats about the speaker and the presumptive nominee's remaining policy differences. It did not signal any level of comfort with Trump's sometimes bombastic style compared to the Midwestern values the speaker tries to embody. Instead, Ryan's decision came down most squarely to attempting to prevent another Democrat from claiming the Oval Office.\n\n\"It's a question of how to move ahead on the ideas that I\u2014and my House colleagues\u2014have invested so much in through the years. It's not just a choice of two people, but of two visions for America,\" Ryan wrote, citing the \"bold\" policy agenda that he will begin rolling out next week and contrasting that with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's platform.\n\n\"Donald Trump can help us make it a reality,\" Ryan said.\n\n[How Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell took such different approaches to supporting Trump]\n\nThe move marks a big about-face for Ryan, who four weeks ago declared he was \"not there yet\" in terms of endorsing Trump and questioned whether the controversial businessman was even a conservative. According to Ryan's team of advisers, the speaker made the decision to support Trump earlier this week \u2014 and by late Wednesday, his senior staff began working on the op-ed for the Gazette in Janesville, Wis.\n\nTrump responded to the announcement on Twitter:\n\nSo great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan. We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2016\n\nRyan and Trump met once in person in mid-May when the billionaire crisscrossed Capitol Hill for meetings with House and Senate leaders. The speaker's advisers said they spoke by phone several other times, with the last call coming last week. Senior Ryan advisers have also remained in close contact with Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, a Republican lobbyist with longtime ties to influential GOP leaders.\n\nThroughout the talks, neither side agreed to switch any of their policy positions, Ryan's advisers said, and one aide suggested that Thursday's endorsement should not be construed as the sort of \"real unification\" of Republicans that Ryan has called for repeatedly since first announcing he was not ready to endorse Trump.\n\nIndeed, it's still not clear if Ryan will ever campaign side-by-side with Trump \u2014 his focus remains on helping elect House Republicans. And at the moment, Ryan still has no formal speaking role at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in late July, beyond his job as convention chairman, which has been a largely honorific role in recent years.\n\nBut Ryan's move may also signal that the speaker and other top Republicans are worried about keeping the House and Senate in Republican hands come November, and believe the best way to do that is to unite the party.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was among the first top leader to say he would back Trump.\n\nWith his support, Ryan became the last senior Republican congressional leader to throw his weight behind Trump's candidacy. While the speaker did not use the word \"endorse,\" he tweeted that he would vote for his party's nominee in November.\n\nI'll be voting for @realDonaldTrump this fall. I'm confident he will help turn the House GOP's agenda into laws. https://t.co/LyaT16khJw \u2014 Paul Ryan (@PRyan) June 2, 2016\n\nAnd Ryan's chief communications adviser, Brendan Buck, said reporters need not mince words to figure out what it all meant.\n\nWe're not playing word games, feel free to call it an endorsement. \u2014 Brendan Buck (@BrendanBuck) June 2, 2016\n\nHis decision may also surprise some of his closest associates, one of whom said as early as this week that Ryan and Trump could not be more different.\n\n\"Paul Ryan in many ways is the antithesis of Donald Trump; he's everything that Donald Trump is not. He's a decent human being. He is a conservative. He is steeped in public policy. He cares about ideas. He's a person who conducts himself with civility and grace in public life. He doesn't put down his opponents,\" said Peter"}

{"id": 526, "ended": true, "length": 721, "text": "Since the death of Freddie Gray at the hands of Baltimore police, many commentators have stressed the need for peaceful protests, while others have expressed empathy for the violent unrest that soon followed. It wasn't long before some in the former camp invoked the ideas of an iconic civil rights leader: \"I just want to hear you say there should be peaceful protests, not violent protests, in the tradition of Martin Luther King,\" Wolf Blitzer told DeRay McKesson, an activist and community organizer he interviewed on CNN on Tuesday.\n\nBut what did MLK really think about urban riots? \"They may be deplored, but they are there and should be understood,\" King said in a speech at the American Psychology Associations' annual convention in Washington, DC, in September 1967. Here's what else he had to say:\n\nUrban riots must now be recognized as durable social phenomena. They may be deplored, but they are there and should be understood. Urban riots are a special form of violence. They are not insurrections. The rioters are not seeking to seize territory or to attain control of institutions. They are mainly intended to shock the white community. They are a distorted form of social protest. The looting which is their principal feature serves many functions. It enables the most enraged and deprived Negro to take hold of consumer goods with the ease the white man does by using his purse. Often the Negro does not even want what he takes; he wants the experience of taking. But most of all, alienated from society and knowing that this society cherishes property above people, he is shocking it by abusing property rights. There are thus elements of emotional catharsis in the violent act. This may explain why most cities in which riots have occurred have not had a repetition, even though the causative conditions remain. It is also noteworthy that the amount of physical harm done to white people other than police is infinitesimal and in Detroit whites and Negroes looted in unity.\n\nA profound judgment of today's riots was expressed by Victor Hugo a century ago. He said, 'If a soul is left in the darkness, sins will be committed. The guilty one is not he who commits the sin, but he who causes the darkness.'\n\nThe policymakers of the white society have caused the darkness; they create discrimination; they structured slums; and they perpetuate unemployment, ignorance and poverty. It is incontestable and deplorable that Negroes have committed crimes; but they are derivative crimes. They are born of the greater crimes of the white society. When we ask Negroes to abide by the law, let us also demand that the white man abide by law in the ghettos. Day-in and day-out he violates welfare laws to deprive the poor of their meager allotments; he flagrantly violates building codes and regulations; his police make a mockery of law; and he violates laws on equal employment and education and the provisions for civic services. The slums are the handiwork of a vicious system of the white society; Negroes live in them but do not make them any more than a prisoner makes a prison. Let us say boldly that if the violations of law by the white man in the slums over the years were calculated and compared with the law-breaking of a few days of riots, the hardened criminal would be the white man. These are often difficult things to say but I have come to see more and more that it is necessary to utter the truth in order to deal with the great problems that we face in our society."}

She tells Neil Hudson what it's like to taste beer for a living\n\nIt sounds like one of those plum jobs people sometimes fantasise about, like being a video games tester or someone who gets paid to sleep, but there's more to being a beer sommelier than meets the eye.\n\nAnnabel Smith, from Horbury, has spent her entire life working in the pub industry, starting off pulling pints behind the bar a her local, the Brewer's Pride in Ossett, in 1990 - it was a 'stop gap' job while still at university. But it was while she was there, she caught the beer bug and found her calling in life.\n\n\"I loved the interaction with people,\" she explains. \"After a couple of years doing it, I became the manager and I stayed there for seven years before going to work for Whitbread.\"\n\nThat job took her to Harrogate, Doncaster and Glasgow, after which she went to work for Di Agio in another job some might fantasise about: training people how to pour the perfect pint of Guinness.\n\nAfter that, she took up a position at Cask Marque, tasting beers and training bar managers.\n\nll\n\nYou might say Annabel eats, sleeps and drinks beer. She can certainly tell you a thing or two about the industry and its history.\n\n\"Guinness is a good example,\" she enthuses. \"A lot of people associate it with a shamrock in the foam but Guinness doesn't endorse that at all and it's a cultural thing. It began in the 1930s in Dublin when there were a lot of Americans coming to the area and one of the way they ended up being marked out was with a shamrock on top of their beer. A lot of people think Guinness was invented in Ireland, too, but it was actually first made in London.\"\n\nOr how about the origins of IPA: \"That started in the 18th Century in England, as a lot of men went out to India as part of the textile trade but because they were often hanging around for months on end, many ended up getting smashed on the local drink, made from fermented palm rice, which was lethal. Only a third of them were coming back alive, which led to the creation of a beer which would be strong enough to survive the six month journey out there and still be safe and they added hops to it partly as an anti-bacterial agent. It was one of the first golden beers, no beer had ever tasted like it before.\"\n\nShe goes on: \"Traditionally, every village had a brewster and it was women's work, she was known as an ale-wife. One of her jobs was whenever someone was getting married, she would make a particularly strong batch beer and it was known as the 'bride ale', which is where we get the word bridal from.\"\n\nHer knowledge of her field is matched only by her passion, which was put to the test during her training to become a sommelier.\n\nShe had to undergo a number of training modules from the Beer Academy and then blind taste 20 beers and be able to speak about their ingredients, flavours and faults. She qualified just before the real ale revolution, which she saw coming.\n\n\"I saw the change coming where beer was changing, partly because off the job I was in at the time. I was a beer taster and training manager for Cask Marque. It was becoming less of a 'poor man's drink'. I was seeing more and more of the cask and real ales coming through. I saw a lot more US beers coming over here. The market was changing and beer was no longer just that warm, flat bitter drunk by old men.\n\n\"When I got the chance to become a beer sommelier, I jumped at the chance. People are familiar with wine sommeliers and our job is similar. They tend to work in the catering industry and use their knowledge to pair wines with foods. While we can do that with beers, our main role is to educate people and change their attitudes.\"\n\nAfter working for Cask Marque, she decided to take the leap and strike out on her own.\n\nSince then, she's never been busier, with events booked at Bishop Aukland, the Blacksheep Brewery and John Lewis in the Bluewater shopping centre, Kent.\n\n\"The thing I was most worried about setting up on my own was not getting any work. But I've not stopped working. It's a growing market and companies are keen to invest in training their staff, because part of the resurgence comes from having an understanding of beer and how it goes together with food.\"\n\nNow she also trains other beer sommeliers, of which there are now about 100 in the country.\n\n\"If there's a change, it's not"}

Films like What We Do in the Shadows (2014) have also shown us that, as neighbors, they might not be all that bad. But according to a recent article on Atlas Obscura, there are some in academia who believe that a shared existence with vampires would be short-lived, and they've done the math to prove it.\n\nIn one 1982 paper quoted by Atlas Obscura from an issue of the RAIRO journal, the authors classified the different types of vampires, then used equations such as \"bloodsucking rate per vampire at time\" to conclude that the \"resource\" of humans would diminish as the vampire population increases (vampire bites human, human becomes vampire).\n\nAtlas Obscura also quotes a 2013 paper published in Applied Mathematical Sciences, whose authors use information from comic books, films, and popular literature to identify and \"draw models of vampire-human confrontation\" based on a predator/prey mathematical model. The researchers concluded that living with vampires would \"lead to great imbalances in the ecosystems.\" In one model, based on works by Bram Stoker and Stephen King, the numbers show that the rate of growth in the vampire population \"would lead to exterminating 80 percent of the human population on the 165th day of the first vampire's arrival.\" Another model, based on the work of Anne Rice, gives humans 48 more years than the first model before total extinction, while a third, more hopeful, estimation says that humans and vampires could coexist if we adopt a system similar to that in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight novels.\n\nTo read more about these completely logical approaches to solving this pressing issue, click through to Atlas Obscura."}

I am unsure of how to fix this issue if you continue to use code that interferes with the CDC. I recommend trying a different method than using the interrupt timers.\n\nWrong Bootloader It's possible to brick your Pro Micro 5V/16MHz if you used the wrong board selection with the wrong frequency. If you upload the wrong frequency, the IC will not be able to understand any new code that is being uploaded. It expects to have code that is compiled for another bootloader, instead of using the 16MHz frequency with the oscillator.\n\nWhen either of these cases happens, the device manager is not able to recognize the device and is usually seen as an \"unknown device\" when the microcontroller runs the sketch. There are ways to recover the an Atmega32U4 (i.e. LilyPad Arduino USB - Atmega32U4 board, FioV3 - Atmega32U4, Pro Micro 5V/16Mhz, Pro Micro - 3.3V/8Mhz, etc) if this happens. Check below for more information:\n\nA.) Upload when LilyPad USB with Atmega32U4/Pro Micro/FioV3 is still in Bootloader Mode\n\nYou can try the double reset method by tapping the RST pin to GND twice (since there is no reset button on the board) as explained in the Troubleshooting sections labeled as Reset to Bootloader and How to Revive a \"Bricked\" Pro Micro => https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro\u2013fio-v3-hookup-guide/troubleshooting-and-faq.\n\n1.) Open the Arduino IDE.\n\n2.) Choose a simple code to upload on the Arduino. I used the blink test code from the hookup guide [ https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro\u2013fio-v3-hookup-guide#example-1-blinkies ] to upload.\n\n3.) Check your Tools>Port menu for the list of COM ports when the Arduino is connected. You will probably not see it in the list.\n\n4.) Click somewhere else to stop viewing the list of COM ports.\n\n5.) Ground the RST button 2x as stated in the Troubleshooting and FAQ [ https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/6/d/\u00be/a/523c8e23757b7fbe5f8b4584.png ].\n\n6.) Re-open the Tools>Port menu to view the list of COM ports again to see what the Pro Micro enumerates to when its in its bootloader. There is an 8 second window to view the COM port when the board is in bootloader mode.\n\nNote: Feel free to use the device manager at this step. Opening up the device manager on your operating system will help to see when the Arduino pops up and disappears.\n\n7.) Select the COM port that the Pro Micro is on before it disappears again.\n\n8.) Hit the Upload button to compile and upload.\n\n9.) Wait a few seconds for the Arduino IDE to compile code. The progress bar should be just over the halfway mark.\n\nNote: On Windows, this takes about 20 seconds to compile and upload. The device will show up as \"SparkFun Pro Micro (COM##)\". Trying this on a Mac seemed a little faster to compile and upload.\n\n10.) Hit the reset button twice again to place the Pro Micro in bootloader mode while the Arduino IDE is uploading.\n\n11.) If successful, you will have no error messages the Arduino IDE will tell you that it is \"Done uploading.\"\n\nAfter selecting the correct board definition and timing the double reset method correctly, I was able to upload successfully.

That was the impetus for the Schizophrenic Photogenic series.\"\n\nDavid Richardson, as model and muse for photographer Chris Buxbaum, creates looks of extreme bodily modifications using everyday objects as makeup and accessories. In their collaborative photo show Schizophrenic Photogenic, Richardson presents himself as dozens of creature-characters for the camera. Echoing the legacy of club-kid artist and fashion impresario Leigh Bowery, this body of work celebrates the act of transformation of the male body.\n\n\"Changing wigs, adding more makeup, altering lip shape and layering accessories would change me into another persona,\" says Richardson. \"The tight close-up allowed me to concentrate only on the shoulders up, so in most of the shoots I was wearing cargo shorts and tennis shoes below.\"\n\nRichardson's looks for Schizophrenic Photogenic were not expensive couture creations. Look closer at the photos of him and you'll see duct tape lips, Sharpie marker-drawn eyebrows, and detritus turned into accessories. Richardson first learned to create these everyday opulent looks as an Atlanta club kid, and this project was a way for him to relive his fabulous past as drag queen Babydoll Schultz.\n\n\"I've been an avid club goer since the early '80s, when I first discovered the fun of transforming my appearance to fit my mood. In those days I was going out seven nights a week, and each night I aimed for a different look. Being on a limited budget, I became very adept at making something out of nothing. I've sported a garbage look on more than one occasion,\" says Richardson.\n\nPhotographer Chris Buxbaum comes from a similar background in his home country of England. \"The clubs we went to at the beginning were pretty much exclusively gay because they were the only places you could go dressed like a peacock and not get beaten or attacked. It was really, truly underground \u2013 people would arrive dressed quite plainly, then emerge from the bathrooms 30 minutes later as these divinely decadent creatures.\"\n\nBuxbaum cites the club scene of both England and Atlanta as his inspiration, and Schizophrenic Photogenic retraces the punk aesthetic he fell in love with three decades ago.\n\n\"When I moved to Atlanta in 1983, I expected the scene to be duller and a little bit behind, but luckily I was totally wrong,\" says Richardson. \"This was a time when you could go to Weekends, dance your ass off, and then see RuPaul perform, cross the street to Illusions for champagne and an upscale drag show then on to the 24/7 Backstreet then finally finish at the Majestic Diner, which would be packed with club goers at 5am and looked something like a Fellini movie being filmed inside an Edward Hopper painting.\"\n\nAlthough the two of them partied in overlapping circles, they never met until the Atlanta scene died down. Schizophrenic Photogenic was a way for them to recreate and honor their respective underground past\u2014the photos evoke the extravagant fashion and peacock makeup that captivated both of them. Every Tuesday evening for two years, Buxbaum would show up at Richardson's home for a photo shoot, never knowing what strange look Richardson had come up with.\n\n\"It's my favorite moment, when I open his door and see what he has cooked up for me this time,\" says Buxbaum. \"Then we shoot two or three looks in a session. Then I go home and edit for hours on end. I always go for extreme close-ups with the color punched up high. David is a walking work of art \u2013 the rest is just point and shoot.\"\n\nThis is the third show the duo has collaborated on; previously Richardson modeled in drag for a show called \"Transformers\" and for a photo installation for the MODA Design Challenge in 2012. Buxbaum, along with designer Caryn Grossman, created a punk-Victorian living room\u2014featuring chrome-tinted early portraits from the Schizophrenic Photogenic series. The astounding installation, complete with Richardson as Babydoll Schultz in a birdcage headdress, won Buxbaum and Grossman first place.\n\nSchizophrenic Photogenic at Luckie Street Gallery marks the end of this current project. The two are planning their next collaboration, which will push them both to their creative extremes.\n\n\"In 'Deities \u2013 Gods Real and Imagined,' David will portray Shiva, Ganesha etc.,\" says Buxbaum. \"Half the deities will be from real religions, half of them will be straight from David's slightly twisted imagination.

But on a drive to see a friend's new vacation property, he spotted a split-level home for sale at the edge of a pristine lake with an idyllic view of the Swan Mountains\u2014and was smitten.\n\n\"It was breathtaking. You look across the lake and the mountains are right there,\" recalls Gilday, vice president of Silver Spring-based Gilday Renovations. \"The house is on a peninsula. If you stand in the living room and look right and look left, there's nothing but water.\"\n\nGilday and his wife Karen considered the possibilities and commitments of owning a vacation getaway 2,700 miles away from their Maryland residence. The idea of skiing and ice skating in a winter wonderland and spending summers hiking in nearby Glacier National Park won them over. They bought the property and have gone West\u2014with four kids and their dog in tow\u2014once or twice a year ever since.\n\nThough lackluster in style, the 1990s-era, five-bedroom house had good bones, was well insulated and made a perfect base for the family's outdoor pursuits. But over the years, Tom Gilday studied architecture prevalent in the area and gathered ideas for a future renovation. \"The original house didn't take advantage of the views,\" he says. \"I kind of knew what was possible but it took me a while to figure out how to do the transitions.\"\n\nA few years ago, the Gildays decided the time was right to update the house in order to improve the views and also to create an aesthetic that would better reflect its surroundings. While Gilday's design would add about 108 square feet to the existing structure, it would ultimately create a more spacious feel by reconfiguring rooms and introducing more windows.\n\nFirst, he eliminated the raised front entry door and split-level staircase and landing. A new front door on the ground level now opens to a streamlined staircase, making room for a large closet in the entry foyer and built-in bookcases in the living room above.\n\nOn both gabled ends of the second floor, walls with modest windows were traded for great expanses of glass. In the living room, Gilday added a large fireplace\u2014curiously missing in the original home, given its location\u2014and bumped out new glass windows to offer unencumbered mountain views. A new covered porch on the west-facing dining room side helps eliminate solar gain and offers a perfect outdoor perch.\n\nGilday also shifted the master bedroom to the mountain side of the house for better views, expanding it by four feet. A new master bath built into the bedroom left space for a home office in the bedroom's former location. He completely gutted the kitchen, replacing it with new cabinetry, Silestone countertops and updated appliances.\n\nGone are the builder-grade drywall and painted masonite exteriors, replaced by a rugged material palette that lends the home authentic Western style inside and out. Working with J. L. Halverstadt of Wild Wood Eccentrics in Whitefish, Montana, Gilday selected a wide range of reclaimed materials to be used throughout the property for style and sustainability. \"All the lumber, siding, stone, everything used in the house was reclaimed\u2014the beams, the siding on the inside and the outside and the horizontal logs. This is about as green as you can get,\" he says.\n\nMontana-based Brian Quay oversaw construction on-site for Gilday, who managed the project remotely. One of the most challenging details was executing Gilday's window design: The glass was installed into notches in massive reclaimed-wood beams. \"It looks like the glass comes out of the beams themselves,\" explains Gilday.\n\nKaren Gilday furnished the interiors in comfortable, rustic style and selected all of the kitchen and bath cabinetry and materials to complement the home's new look. Artwork the couple has acquired in the region also reflects a Western theme.\n\nThe family now enjoys vacations in the newly completed home more than ever. In the summer, they gather with neighbors around the fire pit and enjoy meals on the new porch. \"The family is always together out there,\" says Gilday. \"We play chess, read\u2014and there's not as much emphasis on TV.\n\n\"The first time I went out there when it was all done,\" he recalls, \"I remember sitting on the porch and looking through the house towards the mountains at dusk. They turned purple, then they turned golden when the sun set. It's a magical place.\"\n\nPhotographer Heidi Long is based in Kalispell, Montana.\n\nRENOVATION DES"}

{"id": 537, "ended": true, "length": 850, "text": "The ghrelin hormone not only stimulates the brain giving rise to an increase in appetite, but also favours the accumulation of lipids in visceral fatty tissue, located in the abdominal zone and considered to be the most harmful. This is the conclusion of research undertaken at Metabolic Research Laboratory of the University Hospital of Navarra, published recently in the International Journal of Obesity.\n\nGhrelin is a hormone produced in the stomach and the function of which is to tell the brain that the body has to be fed. Thus, the level of this secretion increases before eating and decreases after. It is known to be important in the development of obesity, given that, on stimulating the appetite, it favours an increase in body weight, explained Ms Amaia Rodr\u00edguez Murueta-Goyena, doctor in biology and main researcher of the study.\n\nHowever, researchers at the University Hospital of Navarra have discovered that, besides stimulating the hypothalamus to generate appetite, ghrelin also acts on the tabula rasa cortex. They observed how this hormone favoured the accumulation of lipids in visceral fatty tissue. In concrete, it causes the over-expression of the fatty genes that take part in the retention of lipids, explained Ms Rodr\u00edguez.\n\nIt is precisely this accumulated fat in the region of the abdomen that is deemed to be most harmful, as it is accompanied by comorbilities, visceral obesity being related to higher blood pressure or type 2 diabetes. Moreover, being located in the abdominal zone and in direct contact with the liver, this type of fatty tissue favours the formation of liver fat and increases the risk of developing resistance to insulin. Normally, on being associated with hypertension, high levels of triglycerides, resistance to insulin and hypercholesterolemia, visceral fat favours the metabolic syndrome, the researcher pointed out.\n\nGhrelin can show itself in acylated or deacylated form, the difference being in the octanoic acid present in the composition of the former, according to Ms Rodriguez. Previously it was thought that only the acylated form was active in the process of weight increase, but many studies point to both hormones being biologically functional.\n\nFuture development of pharmaceutical drugs\n\nThis discovery of the twin action of ghrelin on the organism opens the door to future treatment for obesity and which, for the time being, is limited to in vitro studies in cell and animal models, the University Hospital researcher pointed out. This inclusive perspective of the functioning of a hormone is necessary in order to design effective pharmaceutical drugs. There are many hormones that intervene in the control of appetite in the hypothalamus and, at the same time, can act on other organs, such as the liver, the muscles or fat, for example. Thus, the medication developed should block the action of ghrelin both on the hypothalamus and on the accumulation of abdominal fat.\n\nAt the same time, stated Ms Rodr\u00edguez, it has to be taken into account that this hormone also acts on the liver and favours the capturing of glucose in the muscle. They observed that the concentration of acylated-form ghreline in the blood increases amongst obese persons and particularly when these, moreover, suffer from diabetes. Thus, obese persons with diabetes have greater tendency to accumulate visceral fat than normoglycemic obese persons. This is a little-studied field which has to be investigated in order to develop pharmaceutical drugs which annul this action of ghrelin.\n\nBlood analysis and stimulation of adipocytes\n\nThe research undertaken at the Metabolic Research Laboratory of the University Hospital of Navarra principally involved the analysis of the blood of 80 patients, both obese and thin, and in the stimulation with ghrelin of the fatty cells from surgical operations. First they analysed the ghrelin levels in the blood. Then, based on the biopsies of visceral fat obtained from 24 patients subjected to various operations, the adipocytes or fatty cells were separated and subsequently stimulated with hormone, which enabled the researchers to evaluate the changes generated in the genes that favoured the lipid accumulation in these isolated adipocytes, explained the researcher."}

Frankly, it's the health care entitlements that are the big drivers of our debt, so we spend more time on the health care entitlements - because that's really where the problem lies, fiscally speaking.\"\n\nRyan said that he believes he has begun convincing President Donald Trump in their private conversations about the need to rein in Medicare, the federal health program that primarily insures the elderly. As a candidate, Trump vowed not to cut spending on Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. (Ryan also suggested congressional Republicans were unlikely to try changing Social Security because the rules of the Senate forbid changes to the program through reconciliation - the procedure the Senate can use to pass legislation with only 50 votes.)\n\n\"I think the president is understanding that choice and competition works everywhere in health care, especially in Medicare,\" Ryan said. \". . . This has been my big thing for many, many years. I think it's the biggest entitlement we've got to reform.\"\n\nRyan's remarks add to the growing signs that top Republicans aim to cut government spending next year. Republicans are close to passing a tax bill nonpartisan analysts say would increase the deficit by at least $1 trillion over a decade. Trump recently called on Congress to move to cut welfare spending after the tax bill, and Senate Republicans have cited the need to reduce the national deficit while growing the economy.\n\n\"You also have to bring spending under control. And not discretionary spending. That isn't the driver of our debt. The driver of our debt is the structure of Social Security and Medicare for future beneficiaries,\" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said last week.\n\nWhile whipping votes for the tax bill, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, attacked \"liberal programs\" for the poor and said Congress needed to stop wasting Americans' money.\n\n\"We're spending ourselves into bankruptcy,\" Hatch said. \"Now, let's just be honest about it: We're in trouble. This country is in deep debt. You don't help the poor by not solving the problems of debt, and you don't help the poor by continually pushing more and more liberal programs through.\"\n\nTrump has not clarified which specific programs would be affected by the proposed \"welfare reform,\" though congressional Republicans are signaling that they aim to impose work requirements on food stamps and direct cash assistance for the poor.\n\n\"We have a welfare system that's trapping people in poverty and effectively paying people not to work,\" Ryan told Kaminsky on Wednesday. \"We've got to work on that.\"\n\nLiberals have alleged that the GOP will use higher deficits - in part caused by their tax bill - as a pretext to accomplish the long-held conservative policy objective of cutting government health-care and social-service spending, which the left believes would hit the poor the hardest.\n\n\"What's coming next is all too predictable: The deficit hawks will come flying back after this bill becomes law,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the ranking Democrat on the finance committee, during a speech on the tax debate. \"Republicans are already saying 'entitlement reform' and 'welfare reform' are next up on the docket. But nobody should be fooled - that's just code for attacks on Medicaid, on Medicare, on Social Security, on anti-hunger programs.\"\n\nOn the Senate floor during the tax debate, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., asked Rubio and Sen. Patrick J. Toomey, R-Pa., to promise that Republicans would not advance cuts to Medicare and Social Security after their tax bill. Toomey said that there was \"no secret plan\" to do so, while Rubio said he opposed cuts to either program for current beneficiaries. However, neither closed the door to changing the programs for future beneficiaries.\n\n\"I am not going to support any cuts to people who are on the program and need those benefits. But I want this program to survive,\" Toomey said. To which Sanders responded: \"He just told you he's going to cut Social Security.\"\n\nMany conservatives have long argued for cutting and changing social safety net programs, arguing that anti-poverty programs have failed and that Social Security spending is growing at an unsustainable rate.\n\nStill, members of both parties have long been reluctant to cut benefits, especially for seniors, due in part to the potential political cost of doing so. And in discussing changes, Republicans, including Rubio, have largely confined their ideas to plans that would affect new beneficiaries, rather than current ones.\n\nBut it"}

This means that if a mishap happens, like power failure, corrupted system or anything that could force the closure of your document in progress, the document may get lost.\n\nFortunately, Microsoft added some safeguards in its office suite to recover losts documents. There are more than one way to recover a lost Word document depending on the version of Microsoft Word you are using. In this tutorial, we are going to list down the easiest methods to recover a lost word document.\n\nRecover Lost Documents in Word 2010 and Above\n\nAdvertising\n\nWith Word 2010, Microsoft introduced a draft feature in which Word creates a temporary draft of all the documents created in it. The draft is available for up to 4 days, after that, it will be deleted. So if you are using Word 2010 or above and the lost document is still under the 4 days period, follow the following instructions to recover the lost document:\n\nOpen Microsoft Word, and click on \"File\" option. Here, navigate to \"info\" and then, click on \"Manage Versions\". You will see a dropdown menu here, click on it and select \"Recover Unsaved Documents\".\n\nMicrosoft Word will provide all recent drafts from which you can select the lost document to open and save it. If this method doesn't work for any reason, you can also try the methods below.\n\nRecover Lost Documents in Word 2007 and Below\n\nWord 2007 and below don't come with any reliable document recovery system by default. So we will have to depend on unreliable sources and hope that you find your lost document in one of the areas.\n\nMethod #1: Recover from Autosave\n\nBy default, Word auto-saves a document every 10 minutes (this can be decreased or increased, see below) that it will automatically recover if the document closed due to a malfunction. Word will not auto-save a file that has been closed willingly using the Word close button. So this method works best when you have lost the document in an accident.To change auto-save time, click on the word menu on the top left side, and select \"Word Options\" from it. Now navigate to the \"Save\" tab and enter the time after which Word should save a document in the empty field next to the option \"Save AutoRecovery information every\".\n\nThe process is simple, if your system breaks down just restart it and launch Microsoft Word. While opening, Word will search if it has any autosave file. If it found any, you will see them on the left side of the blank document. Just click to open in Word and save using the standard save method.\n\nThe autosave feature will not always be able to recover the file, so keep that in mind and don't depend on it. Furthermore, by default, the document will autosave after every 10 minutes, so there is a chance you may lose work done in the last 10 minutes (unless you changed the time).\n\nMethod #:2: Recover from Temporary Files\n\nWhen you are working on a document, a temporary file is also created that contains the same data. There is a chance that when your system failed, that temporary file didn't get deleted and you can recover data from it.Temporary files have \".TMP\" extension with them and you may have to open them with Notepad if Word doesn't work. They may contain lots of other codes along with your document content, so you need to copy only the required data.You can access temporary files in the following directory:C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Word You can also search in the Windows Start menu search bar for \".TMP\" to find all files with \".TMP\" extensions.\n\nFiled in .

Orgeron had Canada use some of the offense Ensminger had run in 2016 as interim offensive coordinator with little success. A meeting followed two days later involving Orgeron, Canada, defensive coordinator Dave Aranda and athletic director Joe Alleva.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by mended,\" Orgeron answered tersely Wednesday.\n\n\"You wanting to do something in the Troy game that he (Canada) didn't want to do,\" the questioner responded at the press conference.\n\n\"Well, I'm the head coach. We're going to do what I want to do,\" Orgeron retorted.\n\nAsked if he was pleased with the progression he and Canada have had, Orgeron answered without mentioning Canada's name.\n\n\"I think it's been fantastic,\" he said. \"The offense has done what we want to do. I think it's been good. For us to win nine games and go 6-1 after the Troy game, I think things have been great.\"\n\nOrgeron had no comments on Canada's future at LSU. Ensminger and Alleva could not be reached for comment. The four coordinators from both LSU and Notre Dame are scheduled for a press conference Friday morning in Orlando, Florida, at the Citrus Bowl, which kicks off at noon Monday on ABC.\n\nDespite playing true freshmen amid injuries and the departure of projected starter Maea Teuhema on the offensive line, Canada improved in 2017 LSU's much-suffering pass offense to No. 8 in the Southeastern Conference and to No. 85 nationally with 201.3 yards a game from No. 12 in the SEC and No. 101 nationally in 2016 with 190.1 yards a game. Total offense went from No. 9 in the SEC and No. 59 nationally with 423 yards a game in 2016 to No. 7 and No. 53, but with fewer yards at 412.\n\nCanada, 45, found success with a finesse attack amid the offensive line deficiencies via a myriad of motion and shifts, which Orgeron criticized early in the season.\n\n\"We've had that discussion about simplifying things,\" Orgeron said on Sept. 25 \u2014 the Monday before the Troy game. \"And we're going to. We're going to streamline what we're doing. Do what our players can do best: play LSU football.\"\n\nLater in the 2017 season, Canada could be heard by players at practice saying, \"It's not my offense.\"\n\nSenior quarterback Danny Etling thrived statistically in Canada's offense, which apparently included Ensminger influences judging from the above comment, as he finished No. 4 in the SEC and No. 12 in the nation in efficiency at 155.3 on 146-of-242 passing for 2,234 yards and 14 touchdowns with two interceptions. It is the highest rank in the all-encompassing passing efficiency statistic by an LSU quarterback since Zach Mettenberger finished No. 4 in the nation and No. 2 in the SEC at 171.4 in 2013. Etling was sixth in the SEC and 53rd nationally in passing efficiency in 2016 at 135.6 (160 of 269 for 2,123 yards with 12 touchdowns and five interceptions).\n\nNate Peterman finished No. 8 in the nation in passing efficiency under Canada at Pittsburgh in 2016 at 163.4 before being drafted in"}
{"id": 549, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Story\n\nA mysterious force called T-Energy is the source of all life and magic in Ancaria. It was originally solely under the control of the ancient race of Seraphim. However, over time as they lost interest in the world, they gave some of their control to the High Elves. With this power, the High Elves quickly became the dominant race of Ancaria. A power struggle is raging between two factions within the High Elves. The nobility and clergy are each trying to gain control over the T-Energy. Other races take advantage of the distraction the conflict provides and try to gain control of the T-Energy themselves, so they can become the dominant and most powerful race. As these events unfold, the T-Energy goes increasingly out of control and changes into a destructive force. A force that mutates creatures, destroys cities, and renders entire regions uninhabitable. The campaign selection you make will determine whether your story involves healing the land, or intensifying the chaos.\n\nVersions: Currently out on the PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 as of May 12, 2009.\n\nCampaign\n\nA piece of the world map (explored areas lit)\n\nThe game features a very-large, open-world map with two campaigns, one called \"Light\" and the other called \"Shadow.\" Throughout the chosen campaign it will crossover with the other, in one example in the Light campaign you are asked to defend a town whilst in Shadow you are asked to attack that same town.\n\nThe player can choose whether their character follows the Light or Shadow path, except for Seraphim and Inquisitor. Those two have their paths set and cannot follow the other. Meaning, a Seraphin can only play through the Light campaign while an Inquisitor can only play through the Shadow campaign.\n\nClasses\n\nThere are 6 classes in the original Sacred 2, the expansion Fire and Ice adds another extra class:\n\nThe Seraphim is an ideal all-around character well suited for beginners and veterans alike. They can use most weapons and wear heavy armor. Their aspects of Exalted Warrior, Celestial Magic and Revered Technology reflect a mix of offensive combat arts and solid protection spells. Efficient buffs like Warding Energy comple the profile of a versatile, strong character class. The Seraphim fights for the light and can only therefore only choose the Light Campagin and may not chose a dark God for her Divine Devotion spell. Her unique mount is a Sabertooth.\n\nThe Shadow Warrior is a robust, hard to kill and skilled fighter, making him perfect for beginners. He is able to use the largest swords and heaviest war axes and maces. His strikes are deadly and is especially a proficient killer in close quarters. His link to the undead allows him to call on fallen comrades to aid him in battle, including summoning up to four skeleton soldiers to fight along side him. His unique mount is the Hellhound.\n\nOf all the character classes in Sacred 2, the High Elf comes the closest to being a \"classic mage\" She has three magic-based aspects at her command. Arrant Pyromancer which is especially useful for learning fire spells. Mystic Stormite, which grants her access to a number of ice-based spells, and Delphic Arcania which contains special protection spells such as a teleport spell and a banishing circle. The High Elf's constitution is relatively weak and therefor she is easily wounded by melee attacks. In a fight she is dependent on the use of her combat arts, so playing her requires more strategy than that of a melee class. Her unique mount is the Wind Serpent.\n\nWhile the High Elves work mainly with elemental magic, their enemies, the Dryads, focus on nature. Capricious Hunter, Cabalistic Voodoo, and Nature Weaver are the aspects used by the Dryad. She is also the ranged combat specialist among the character classes and starts off with a blowgun and a better than average dexterity value. No one can beat this character when it comes to bows and blowguns. At the same time, her magic is relatively weak initially and as such, is recommended more for advanced and veteran players. Her unique mount is the Monitor Lizard.\n\nThe Temple Guardian is a special character who can access T-Energy directly. In contrast to the other characters, one of his most important weapons - his weapons arm - is already built in, meaning his left arm changes with whatever combat art is used at the time. He is always able to fire a bolt of energy\n\nfor this arm, but as such cannot dual wield, use two-handed weapons, or use a shield. Due to his unique abilities, he makes an excellent support character in co-op play, but is better suited for experienced players in single player campaign. His unique mount is a Mobiculum. He is also the only character that can be only played in the 'good' campaign.\n\nThe Inquisitor is the complete inverse of a the Seraphim and is to the powers of Darkness what the"}

That's the slowest growth since at least 2005, according to company filings. Net income fell 22 percent in the quarter, according to the filings.\n\nSlowing growth at the unit of Unilever Plc belies government data that shows economic expansion in India is outpacing China's. Demand in the South Asian nation's villages, which was increasing at about 1.5 times the rate of cities until two years ago, has slowed \"significantly\", and that has had an adverse effect on the entire consumer goods industry, Hindustan Unilever Chief Executive Officer Sanjiv Mehta said.\n\n\"We are sitting in a deflationary environment,\" Chief Financial Officer P.B. Balaji said, referring to the drop in commodity prices that has led companies to cut prices of most products. \"Price growth is a challenge.\"\n\nCompetition in the consumer goods sector has increased substantially in the past year, and that combined with the pressure to cut prices makes it \"very difficult\" for entrenched companies to expand the market, said Naveen Trivedi, an analyst at Trust Financial Consultancy Services Pvt. The fact that they are returning money to shareholders suggests there are few avenues to invest it, including in acquisitions, he said.\n\nExcess Money\n\nHindustan Unilever will seek court approval for the cash transfer, and will then decide whether to return it as a dividend or in some other form, Balaji said. The payout, which comes three years after it increased royalty payments to its parent, should be complete within six months to an year, he said. Parent Unilever, with its 67.2 percent holding in the Indian company, will get the biggest share of the cash.\n\n\"Only after we forecast our current needs, foreseeable future needs, business plan, we then realized this is just pure surplus cash,\" Balaji said. Returning the money to shareholders is \"sign of confidence that we can run the business quite comfortably.\"\n\nHindustan Unilever's shares fell 2.8 percent to 804.25 rupees in Mumbai, the biggest drop since Aug. 24. Net income fell to 9.71 billion rupees in the quarter ended Dec. 31, missing analysts' estimate of 10.4 billion rupees. That's the biggest drop in profit since the three months ended June 2013. However sales volume, considered the most important metric among analysts, grew 6 percent partly because the company passed on the benefit of lower commodity prices to buyers, Balaji said.\n\nIndia's government reported growth accelerated to 7.4 percent in the three months through September from 7 percent in the prior quarter. Mumbai-based brokerage Ambit Capital Pvt. estimates a deceleration to 6 percent from 6.3 percent.

{"id": 553, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Single-sensor cameras fall into two camps: those that are sensitive to far red, and those that are sensitive to infrared. The Canon C300 is sensitive to far red, which means that IRND filters will work\u2013and hot mirrors won't. Come see the difference\u2026\n\nRED cameras are the only cameras that are truly sensitive to a form of infrared light\u2013near infrared\u2013which falls at around 800nm on the electromagnetic spectrum. All other single sensor cameras are sensitive to far red, which comprises wavelengths around 700nm. (The visible spectrum runs from violet, at 400nm, to dark red, at 700nm.) Far red is on the very edge of the visible spectrum, and while our eyes respond to it somewhat they don't respond in the same way that a camera does.\n\nLong the bastard stepchild of the NTSC color world, modern cameras reproduce red more faithfully and vibrantly than any SD camera ever could. This ability comes at a cost, though: cameras can't really see the world the way we do, so we must expect some variability.\n\nThis is my fabric IRND chart, made with common materials found at the U.S. chain store JoAnn's Fabrics. Some of the fabrics reflect far red/near IR and some don't. I've been using this chart for years now. (As you can see it's getting a little beaten up. Infrared will do that.)\n\nNear IR and far red contamination typically show up when using standard neutral density filters, because NDs block visible light but allow far red/near IR to pass. The heavier the ND, the less visible light is passed, and opening up the stop to compensate for this lets in a lot more far red/near IR. Typically far red/near IR isn't visible when shooting without ND filters, but we'll see an example in a moment where that's not the case.\n\nI chose Cine1 matrix as it's representative of the color response of the C300's \"Cine\" matrices. The camera \"matrix\" is the bit of software that bends the sensor's raw color into a form that we find pleasing. There are nearly infinite ways that this can be done, and this bit of math is a large part of every camera manufacturer's \"secret sauce.\"\n\nThis is the EOS color matrix. It is, by far, the most saturated matrix in the camera, and therefore the least likely to be used. (Strong, saturated colors tend to appeal mostly to children and those who are not terribly sophisticated visually. I don't know a single cinematographer who would find this matrix appealing except as a special effect.) What's interesting is that we can see some far red contamination in the middle patch on the top row and the two leftmost patches on the bottom row in spite of the fact that I've not changed anything optically. It appears that far red contamination is present even without adding any ND filtration\u2013but it's only visible if you opt to use the most saturated color matrix in the camera.\n\nIf you can't see it, it doesn't matter.\n\nI've added a Schneider ND 1.8 filter to the mix. Far red contamination is dramatically obvious here. I've switched back to Cine1 gamma, which is why the color is a bit on the subtle side. I used a Schneider ND simply because that's what most rental houses seem to carry. (I shot these tests at Chater Camera.)\n\nI've replaced the regular ND with a Tiffen IRND 1.8. The IRND line has a green dye that absorbs far red between 680nm and 700nm, eliminating far red contamination. This is different from a hot mirror, like the Tiffen Hot Mirror or Schneider Tru-Cut IR 750, which cuts much higher in the spectrum. The C300's sensor has a perfectly functional hot mirror in front of it, so adding another hot mirror will have no effect because the on-sensor hot mirror is already removing near infrared wavelengths from the optical path. Doubling up on hot mirrors does nothing more than what a single hot mirror can do.\n\nWhile the IRND removes obnoxious far red contamination from fabrics it can also cause flesh tones and red fabrics to lose a bit of lustre. This is not a filter issue, but simply a fact of life: the sensitivity of modern sensors to far red creates a much richer red palette than we've had before, so removing some of that to compensate for unwanted far red contamination will most likely affect other things in the frame.\n\nThe Schneider Platinum IR (PtIR) ND 1.8 filter does much the same job as the Tiffen IRND 1.8 did. I chose ND 1.8 for this test as ND filters pass less than 1% of visible light at that strength and manufacturing defects, in the form of color shifts, tend to show up fairly quickly.

The company did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nSecurity researchers have always warned that if vendors take too much time to address a reported vulnerability it might be discovered by the bad guys in the meantime, if they don't already know about it.\n\nIt happened on multiple occasions for different bug hunters to discover the same vulnerability in the same product independently and this is what might have also happened in the case of the two actively exploited Java vulnerabilities that were addressed by Java 7 Update 7.\n\n\"Independent discoveries can never be excluded,\" Gowdiak said. \"This specific issue [the new vulnerability] might be however a little bit more difficult to find.\"\n\nBased on the experience of Security Explorations researchers with hunting for Java vulnerabilities so far, Java 6 has better security than Java 7. \"Java 7 was surprisingly much easier for us to break,\" Gowdiak said. \"For Java 6, we didn't manage to achieve a full sandbox compromise, except for the issue discovered in Apple Quicktime for Java software.\"\n\nGowdiak has echoed what many security researchers have said before: If you don't need Java, uninstall it from your system.\n\nJoin the newsletter!

You can easily program in C/C++, java, fortran, python, perl, php, ruby, tcl, lisp ... and many more.\n\nScripting Languages\n\nScripting languages are usually easy to learn and use. They are called scripting languages because they are interpreted instead of compiled to machine language like C/C++ for example.\n\nPerl\n\nPerl is very popular with web programmers and system administrators. One of Perl's main features is regular expressions. Most languages now include regular expressions but Perl is particularly powerful when processing a lot of text. Perl is already installed on your Ubuntu system by default. Visit the Perl website for more information. Perl has a large number of extensions written for it; visit cpan.perl.org to find them.\n\nPHP\n\nPHP is the language that put the \"P\" in LAMP, which is the technology that runs most of the internet (Linux, Apache, mySQL, PHP). PHP is a powerful and flexible language, it is used extensively to run high performance web sites such as Facebook and Yahoo, however it is also great for writing system admin scripts too. It has full support for Perl Regular Expressions as well as Object programming. PHP is much newer than Perl so it has not seen as much use by system administrators, it is not pre-installed on Ubuntu but you can easily add it using the Synaptic Package Manager to Install PHP5. There are 3 versions of PHP available, PHP5-cli is for running programs on the command line, you can use this to create ncurses programs and even daemons. PHP5-cgi and libapache2-mod-php5 are for web servers. There are a huge number of libraries and extensions along with excellent documentation available on the www.php.net web site.\n\nPython\n\nOut of the box Ubuntu comes with Python and many extension modules. Python is very powerful and easy to use. In fact it is the preferred language by most of the Ubuntu developers. You can easily play with python interactively. Start a terminal and type python[enter]. For a more elaborate tutorial and other useful information about Python, visit http://www.python.org\n\nRuby\n\nRuby is a \"dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.\" Check out http://www.ruby-lang.org for more. Ruby is also installed by default on your system.\n\nYou might want to install the irb package to use the ruby interactive interpreter.\n\nOthers\n\nThis is a collection of other extremely useful languages.\n\nC and C++\n\nC is not usually a great language to begin programming with but it is the most powerful programming language in popular use. If you need speed and efficiency, C is the best choice. The Linux kernel, the heart of the Ubuntu operating system, is written in C. C++ is mostly an extension of C. C++ has the main advantage of being an Object Oriented language. (With some talent C can also be used for OOP). To use C and C++ you will need to install the build-essential package.\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nYou can now compile C and C++ programs with gcc and g++. Read their respective man pages for more information.\n\nGambas\n\nGambas is similar to Microsoft's Visual Basic (and almost compatible), but example with object extensions. With Gambas you can very easily and quickly develop programs for GTK+ and Qt4 environments. Gambas has very easy to use Visual Basic like IDE for building graphical user interfaces. And Gambas includes many example programs to ease learning.\n\nWith Gambas you can easily develop programs using:\n\nDatabases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, ODBC and SQLite\n\nOpenGL (fast 2D and 3D graphics)\n\nCGI web applications\n\nD-Bus\n\nWebkit\n\nSDL\n\nV4L (Video 4 Linux can be used to control example webcam)\n\nExternal libraries\n\netc etc\n\nGambas has comprehensive localization features, like build in translation application. Also Gambas programs are faster to execute than equivalent Python and Perl programs.\n\nMore info from: gambas.sourceforge.net/en/main.html and en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambas\n\nJava\n\nJava was created by Sun Microsystems and is now used all over the place. The beauty of Java is its power, combined with its portability. Programs written in Java can usually be run across multiple operating systems on multiple machine architectures without a need to recompile like C/C++, as long as there is a Java Virtual Machine available on the desired OS and platform. Java is a popular language"}

{"id": 557, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "It all happened so quickly, about a year ago today. One minute, hardly anyone had heard of the ad-free social network Ello. The next, it was a viral sensation, spawning countless think pieces on its chances for survival. Then, as quickly as it appeared, Ello faded from the spotlight. Now, only a year later, Ello is nearly forgotten, filed away with other would-be Facebook killers like the open source Diaspora and the near-dead Google+.\n\nAll three are still around, but needless to say, none has managed to lead a mass exodus away from Facebook. Meanwhile, the conversation among Facebook's critics seems to have shifted from trying to replace the service with something better to pressuring the company to improve its privacy protections and ditch its real-name policy.\n\nBut one service has quietly emerged as the go-to alternative to Facebook and other big social media sites: the email newsletter service TinyLetter.\n\nYour list of email addresses is yours in a way few things online ever are.\n\nThe site, owned by email marketing company Mailchimp, has managed to avoid two of the biggest pitfalls of other Facebook alternatives: technical complexity and the empty room problem. First of all, it's incredibly easy to use. Sending a newsletter is as simple as posting a status update to Facebook. Secondly, you don't have to convince people to install yet another app in order to build an audience. Anyone with an email address\u2014which is pretty much everyone, despite many efforts to kill email\u2014can subscribe to your newsletter.\n\nJournalists and techies have flocked to TinyLetter in recent years, slowly building its reputation as the hippest place to publish online. But it's also starting to catch on outside the media and technology bubbles with newsletters dedicated to yoga, poetry and music, among other things. Today it has more than 161,000 users creating newsletters and more than 14 million subscribers to those newsletters, says Mailchimp's Kate Kiefer Lee.\n\nYes, this means TinyLetter isn't about to catch up with Twitter and its 316 million active monthly users, let alone Facebook's 1.5 billion. But it doesn't actually have to displace social networks to succeed. Rather, it provides a viable way for people to reach an audience without depending exclusively on Facebook or anyone else's closed platform.\n\nJust a Newsletter\n\nMailchimp doesn't bill TinyLetter as a Facebook replacement, nor was it ever meant to be. When entrepreneur Philip \"Pud\" Kaplan created the site in 2010, he told TechCrunch he thought of it as an alternative to blogs. In the early 2000s, Kaplan ran Fuckedcompany, a site that tracked the demise of tech companies during the dotcom crash of the early 2000s. Fuckedcompany had an email newsletter that reached thousands of people, and Kaplan wanted a way to reach a large audience without the work that goes into maintaining a personal blog.\n\nOf course many other mailing list applications also exist, but Kaplan was frustrated by their complexity. What sets TinyLetter apart is its simplicity. TinyLetter offers limited analytics and doesn't include advanced features such as the ability to send messages to a select portion of your audience. But this lack of options also makes it far easier to use.\n\n\"TinyLetter appealed because I didn't want to start, you know, a mailing list,\" explains Fusion editor-in-chief and former WIRED contributor Alexis Madrigal, who publishes a newsletter called RealFuture. \"I wanted to start a newsletter.\"\n\nThe service soon attracted high-profile users such as Digg co-founder and former Google Ventures partner Kevin Rose. It was sold off to Mailchimp. But there was no real \"viral moment\" for the site. Instead, it's been a slow, steady build. Journalists like Ann Friedman and Madrigal boosted the service's visibility, as did programmer Rusty Foster, whose daily newsletter on the best and the worst of the internet, Today in Tabs, became a Newsweek online column before being picked up by Fast Company. But none of the newsletterists we talked to for this story could remember exactly where they heard about the service.\n\n\"Somehow, my fingers knew to type in that URL when I woke up one morning and decided to make the thing,\" says Madrigal.\n\nWhy Email\n\n\"Why TinyLetter?\" is an easier question to answer than \"why email newsletters?\" For many users, social media has become impersonal. Facebook algorithmically curates what we see, while Twitter overwhelms us with a firehose of fast-moving content, and LinkedIn is, well, LinkedIn. The most important part of the email newsletter's appeal is that it still feels intimate\u2014even if you are sending emails to total strangers. \"Email is a weird medium, it's both personal and massive,\" says Foster.\n\nThough it's harder to get people to sign-up for an email newsletter than it is to follow your Twitter account"}

Today, detractors try to use Social Security Disability Insurance as a back door to cut the program as a whole. And, we will organize and fight back against today's attacks aimed at some of the most vulnerable Americans: the disabled.\" Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH)\n\nDivide and conquer politics is certainly nothing new in Washington. From Ronald Reagan's mythological nation of \"welfare queens\" to Alan Simpson's \"greedy geezer\" myth of hordes of seniors driving Lexus' to their gated communities \u2013 politicians love to create villains, even if the facts simply don't back up the political spin.\n\n\"It hangs together as a good story because it's consistent with people's perception of the real world,\" says Craig R. Smith, who was a speechwriter for former President Gerald Ford and a consulting writer with President George H.W. Bush. \"Like in any good mythology, you need heroes and villains and in the Welfare Queen, you had a villain who was taking advantage of the system.\"\n\nAnd so it goes with conservatives' latest target \u2013 disabled Americans receiving Social Security benefits. No doubt, you've already heard the messaging: Social Security disability fraud is rampant because it's so easy to receive benefits and people would rather collect a hefty check from the government than work. It's the 2014 incarnation of \"our nation is full of 'welfare queens' and 'greedy geezers.'\" It also suffers from the same basic problem\u2026it's simply not true.\n\nSo let's break down a few of these Disability Myths.\n\nMYTH: \"Disability has become a form of permanent welfare for a lot of folks. It's not that hard to prove a mental illness, or mental issues, or pain issues.\" Nina Easton, Fox News commentator\n\nNot that hard? So, why are the vast majority of claims denied?\n\nFACT: \"Nearly 80 percent of applicants are denied at the initial level, and fewer than 4 in 10 are approved after all levels of appeal. Underscoring the strictness of the disability standard, thousands of applicants die each year while waiting for benefits. And one in five male and nearly one in six female beneficiaries die within five years of being approved for benefits. Disability Insurance beneficiaries have death rates three to six times higher than other people their age.\" Center for American Progress\n\nIt's seems pretty ridiculous to claim the system's being widely-abused when so many die just years after receiving benefits or while they're still waiting for an answer.\n\nMYTH: Growth in disability claims is \"astonishing\", an \"epidemic\" and \"startling.\"\n\nActually, it's called demographics. Ever heard of the baby boomers? Former SSA Commissioners from both Republican and Democratic administrations have taken issue with this fact-free, hysteria-laden portrayal of the disability program's growth.\n\nFACT: \"It is true that DI has grown significantly in the past 30 years. The growth that we've seen was predicted by actuaries as early as 1994 and is mostly the result of two factors: baby boomers entering their high -disability years, and women entering the workforce in large numbers in the 1970s and 1980s so that more are now \"insured\" for DI based on their own prior contributions.\" Open Letter from former SSA Commissioners\n\n\"\u2026four-fifths of the program's total enrollment in 2013 \u2014 and over two-thirds of the growth in enrollment since 1980 \u2014 stems from five easily quantifiable factors: growth in the overall working-age population, the aging of that population, growth in women's labor force participation, the rise in Social Security's full retirement age, and the growth in DI receipt among women eligible for benefits to match men's rate of receipt. In short, the factors driving DI's growth are reasonably well understood, were long anticipated, and do not depict a program that is 'out of control.'\" Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\n\n\"As Baby Boomers retire, the program's growth has already leveled off and is projected to decline further in the coming years.\" Center for American Progress\n\nMYTH: The entire system is \"broken,\" rife with \"fraud\" and \"rubber-stamping judges\" bankrupting the entire Social Security program.\n\nFACT: The Government Accountability Office found that improper payments of Social Security benefits that include Disability Insurance had an error rate of just 0.6 percent. Government Accountability Office An investigation by the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General looked at the 10 states with the highest increase in disability applications from 2007-2011.

The move means he won't play the rest of the season. Robert Scheer/IndyStar\n\nIn October, Andrew Luck was throwing during practices with the team. Now he's shut down from practice and Thursday was placed on injured reserve. He won't play this season. (Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2013 The biggest question facing the Indianapolis Colts in 2018 will be the same question hovering over the franchise in 2017:\n\nHow's Andrew Luck?\n\nIn these parts, if you've heard that question once, you've heard it a million times. And buckle up: Because you're going to hear it again and again and again.\n\nThe Colts placed Andrew Luck on their injured reserve list Thursday, ensuring the Pro Bowl quarterback won't play in 2017.\n\nHis season, which never really got started, is now officially over.\n\nAnd, now, here come the questions. Will he need more surgery? Is his career in jeopardy? Will he be ready for the start of next season?\n\nLately, there seem to be more questions than answers around this franchise. Whether the issue is Luck's health, the future of coach Chuck Pagano or how long the ongoing roster makeover will take, the Colts face many unknowns.\n\nAs it relates to Luck, a few preliminary answers were offered by General Manager Chris Ballard on Thursday. There is no surgery planned, Ballard said. Luck has seen several doctors recently after soreness in his shoulder persisted for more than two weeks. Luck previously had returned to practice and seemed on track to return to the lineup, as previously planned.\n\nCLOSE Stephen Holder, IndyStar Colts Insider, breaks down the news about Andrew Luck being put on injured reserve, ending his playing season, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017. Robert Scheer/IndyStar\n\nThe good news is the doctors, Ballard said, were in agreement on how to address Luck's current soreness. They recommended more \"hard rehab,\" as Ballard put it, a different regimen than the one previously used. This time it's aimed specifically at relieving the current soreness.\n\n\"The shoulder's tied in a bunch of different ways, from the scapula to the other muscles around it,\" Ballard said. \"And getting them all to work together properly is a little bit of the issue. Trying to get them to work together could be causing the soreness issue. So, continue to rehab, continue to strengthen and continue flexibility. \u2026 We'll continue down that path and get them all working together and get him going in the right direction.\"\n\nBallard said there is no indication Luck's career is in any jeopardy.\n\n\"That's not the case here. I've not got that from one doctor,\" Ballard said. \"Career-ending is putting him out on the field before he's ready to play. That's where you should be concerned.\"\n\nSo, back to the training room Luck goes, mere weeks after he talked about finally seeing \"the finish line\" following months of working toward a return.\n\nAnd, back to the same ol' same ol' for Colts fans. Which is to say back to the question everyone wants to answer, but can't: How's Luck doing?\n\nThe Colts' entire 2018 offseason will be dominated by that question. Until Luck takes another snap in an NFL game, the avalanche of questions will persist.\n\nOh, the Colts are working under the assumption Luck will suit up for the start of 2018. Then again, they also thought he'd play at some point in 2017.\n\n\"We'll take the approach that he's going to be there,\" Ballard said regarding Luck's availability for the start of next season.\n\nBut Ballard was careful to not predict exactly how long Luck would be back in rehab mode before starting to throw again. The Colts will resume offseason work in April as they begin working toward the 2018 season.\n\nBy then, the Colts likely will have undergone major changes. A coaching change could be in the cards. The draft will be approaching with, presumably, a very high pick for struggling Indianapolis. And the Colts' roster overhaul will be still be in full swing, with everything from the offensive line and receiving corps likely to be addressed in a significant way.\n\nAdd to all that the uncertainty about Luck and you can go ahead and pencil in the Colts as a team experts will again pronounce to be an also-ran heading into next season. The rebuilding effort is already looking like a process that could take a couple more years, based on the sporadic talent currently on the roster. Throw in Luck's situation and what reason could there possibly be to expect much of the Colts in 2018?\n\nRemember, this is a Pro Bowl quarterback, not some random slot"}

If you buy yeast in bulk (e.g., a 1-pound vacuum-packed brick), open it up; divide it into 3 or 4 smaller portions, and store each in a tightly closed container. A zip-top freezer bag works well. When you're ready to use yeast, remove the bag or jar from the freezer, spoon out what you need, and quickly return it to the freezer. Yeast manufacturers say you should let frozen yeast rest at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes before using; frankly, we're usually too impatient to do that, and have never experienced any problem using yeast straight from the freezer.\n\nCan I use active dry and instant yeasts interchangeably?\n\nYes, they can be substituted for one another 1:1. We've found that active dry yeast is a little bit slower off the mark than instant, as far as dough rising goes; but in a long (2- to 3-hour) rise, the active dry yeast catches up. If a recipe using instant yeast calls for the dough to \"double in size, about 1 hour,\" you may want to mentally add 15 to 20 minutes to this time if you're using active dry yeast. When dough is rising, you need to judge it by how much it's risen, not how long it takes; cold weather, low barometric pressure, how often you bake, and a host of other factors affect dough rising times, so use them as a guide, not an unbreakable rule. Remember, bread-baking involves living things (yeast), your own personal touch in kneading technique, and the atmosphere of your kitchen; there are so many variables that it's impossible to say that \"Dough X will double in size in 60 minutes.\" Baking with yeast is a combination of art, science and a bit of magic; stay flexible, and your bread (and you!) will be just fine. One time when you might not want to use instant and active dry yeasts interchangeably is when you're baking bread in a bread machine. Since bread machines use a higher temperature to raise dough, substituting instant for active dry yeast 1:1 may cause bread to over-rise, then collapse. When baking in the bread machine, and substituting instant yeast for active dry, reduce the amount of instant yeast by 25%.\n\nHow much is a \"packet\" of yeast?\n\nYou may find older recipes calling for \"1 packet active dry yeast.\" A packet used to include 1 tablespoon of yeast; currently, it's closer to 2 generous teaspoons, a tribute to improved manufacturing methods that produce stronger, more active yeast.\n\nCan I vary the amount of yeast in a recipe to quicken or slow down how my dough rises?\n\nThe amount of yeast you use in your bread dough has a significant bearing on how quickly it'll rise, and thus on your own schedule. By reducing the yeast, you ensure a long, slow rise, one more likely to produce a strong dough able to withstand the rigors of baking. The more yeast in a recipe initially, the quicker it produces CO 2 , alcohol, and organic acids. Alcohol, being acidic, weakens the gluten in the dough, and eventually the dough becomes \"porous,\" and won't rise; or won't rise very well. By starting with a smaller amount of yeast, you slow down the amount of CO 2 , alcohol, and organic acids being released into the dough, thus ensuring the gluten remains strong and the bread rises well\u2014from its initial rise in the bowl, to its final rise in the oven. Remember that this slow rise extends to the shaped loaf, as well as dough in the bowl. Once you've shaped your loaf, covered it, and set it aside to rise again, it may take 2 hours or more, rather than the usual 1 to 1 1/2, to rise fully and be ready for the oven. Keep in mind, also, the characteristics of your own kitchen. If you bake bread all the time, your kitchen is full of wild yeast, and any dough you make there will rise vigorously. If you seldom bake bread, or are just beginning, your kitchen will be quite \"sterile;\" your dough won't be aided by wild yeast, and will rise more slowly than it would in a more \"active\" kitchen. Here are some guidelines to get you started. If you're an occasional bread baker, cut back the usual 2 to 2 1/2; teaspoons of instant yeast to 1/2 to 1 teaspoon, depending on how long you want to let the dough ferment before the final shape-rise-bake process. 1/2 teaspoon would give you lots of flexibility, such as letting the dough \"rest\" for 16 to 20 hours; 1 teaspoon would be a good amount for an all-day or overnight rise ("}

They agree on nothing. But one thing they have in common\u2014they both are men. The feminist, Thomas says, is \"a guy who gets it.\"\n\nThe story is instructive when thinking about Amar Singh, the 28-year old straight Harvard graduate Indian royal, born and raised in Britain, who is passionate about art, investments, targeted philanthropy\u2014and aggressively but smartly championing women and LGBT rights. Without intention, Singh encapsulates the charismatic concern of presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy during his trips to long-neglected Harlem\u2014that family sense of noblesse oblige tossed to the wind as RFK humbly grasps the outstretched hand of a poor black woman desperate for someone to do something, not just pontificate on the hell of poverty.\n\nSingh gets that, too. \"There are three tiers of suppression: female, LGBT, and caste\u2014which is actually meant to be illegal but prevails very heavily in India,\" Singh, a member of the Kapurthala Royal Family, told The Los Angeles Blade recently over tea at SoHo House in West Hollywood. No matter one's talent, education, or aspiration, the caste system dictates work and social relationships. It perpetuates the notion of the \"untouchables\" common during colonial imperialism.\n\nSingh wants to change that\u2014along with the oppressive state of women and LGBT rights. And here's where Thomas' story is again instructive: he's working to change the culture\u2014and with it, the political landscape\u2014through one-on-one conversations.\n\nFor the past several years, the art collector and dealer has simultaneously created his boutique Amar Gallery in London and funded a clandestine campaign in India to educate and change people's minds. He says he's building \"an army of love.\"\n\n\"My grassroots group in India helps spread a message of peace in support of LGBT and women's rights because the reality is the majority of the country is being suppressed,\" Singh says. \"A population of 1.1 billion and the majority of the country is suppressed. Now imagine if they were championed. We could have one of the greatest forces on earth. We certainly have the resources but when you have 800-900 million people who are downtrodden\u2014how can we progress?\"\n\nSingh says he hasn't yet spoken with Prime Minister Narendra Modi about women's and LGBT rights\u2014but he would like to. Modi assumed power in 2014, shortly after India's Supreme Court reinstated the repealed British colonial anti-gay law, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, that forbids \"carnal intercourse against the order of nature\" with punishment up to 10 years in jail.\n\nThere was cause for optimism at the prospect of the law being overturned during the recent pride parade in New Delhi, VOA News reported Nov. 18, after word spread that the court may review the ruling.\n\n\"Five out of the nine judges, it was a nine judge bench, actually questioned the validity of 377. To me that is amazing. I feel a little easier after the privacy judgment,\" Anjali Gopalan, founder of the Naz Foundation, told VOA, adding that the gay community felt \"abandoned\" in 2013 when the law was reinstated.\n\nSingh, normally a very optimistic guy, is only cautiously optimistic. \"I hope the prospect of abolishing the 377 penal code is not another false alarm,\" he says. \"I hope the drums of India's pride parade beat louder and faster until the voices of hate are drowned out.\"\n\nHe is very confident, however, in \"the power of conversation.\" As a parallel example of his initiative, he refers to the PBS documentary \"Accidental Courtesy,\" the story of blues musician Daryl Davis' journey to convert KKK members from racism to at least friendship with a black man.\n\n\"Daryl Davis is an inspiration because he befriends over 200 members of the Ku Klux Klan,\" says Singh. \"He actually, through conversation and education, asks the question: 'how can you hate me when you don't even know me?' And they transform and realize their ideals were wrong because their ideals encroached upon human rights. And these former Klan members are better people for that.\" Davis, he says, \"did it so masterfully, I think I could learn a lot from his example.\"\n\nBut unlike Davis who can put his journey on television, Singh says his grassroots movement \"is secretive because if people knew the individuals championing and spreading the message of peace and LGBT rights, their lives would be in danger. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nAnd yet, they speak to thousands of people a year, sometimes at rallies, sometimes door-to-door, sometimes in their shacks.\n\n"}

Some tried to talk me out of it. Yeah, nice try. Feature: I feel the components that were matched with it work very well. If any changes were made, would be with the resister / Capacitor network to give it just a wee more volume at full setting.

Ease of Use: I do not see how anyone, even at a most basic novices of knowledge, could make bad music with this. The tones are smooth with zero back ground noise even at higher amp settings. The design of the neck and fret board makes it easy to play. No need to press hard anywhere on the fret board. No tricks needed to learn. It will spoil you. Quality: It is made very well and I suspect It will be my main instrument for many years to come. Value: Yes it is worth twice the price. I have picked up other Basses that cost more and better known and was astounded they did not play as well or sounded as good. Manufacturer Support: I have not needed to contact them. But it would concern me if they do not quickly respond to a need or question only they can answer. The Wow Factor: 10 out of 10. For me, picking it up and playing it stuck in my mind. I went in three times and it drew me like a magnet. I had to take it home. It just looks, sounds, and plays awesome Overall: I love this Bass.

The BBC's Panorama documentary, the timing of which had been branded \"unpatriotic\" by bid executives before broadcast and \"frustrating\" by the prime minister, David Cameron, also contained fresh allegations against the Concacaf president, Jack Warner, concerning a ticketing scandal linked to the 2010 World Cup.\n\nWarner and the three votes he controls are seen as key to England's hopes of progressing beyond the first round and Prince William, David Beckham and Cameron \u2013 the bid's \"three lions\", as the chief executive, Andy Anson, called them \u2013 will be called upon to try to limit the damage. Cameron will arrive in Zurich tomorrow and is expected to meet Warner, who has been scathing in his criticism of the BBC documentary.\n\nCritics of the timing of the programme tonight insisted that the strength and topicality of the new allegations did not justify broadcasting it three days before the vote \u2013 particularly as the claims had nothing to do with the bidding process.\n\nEngland 2018 also condemned the programme, calling it \"an embarrassment\" to the BBC. They said in a statement: \"We stand by our previous position that the BBC's Panorama did nothing more than rake over a series of historical allegations none of which are relevant to the current bidding process. It should be seen as an embarrassment to the BBC.\"\n\nWarner, embroiled in an earlier ticketing scandal at the 2006 World Cup, was tonight alleged to have ordered tickets costing $84,240 from the Fifa ticket office for the 2010 tournament, only for the deal to fall through.\n\nOn the back of the Sunday Times investigation that led to the suspension of six Fifa officials but created a climate of suspicion among the electorate, the Panorama allegations are likely to lead to further hostility against the British media.\n\nThe claims will lead to renewed calls for Fifa to answer outstanding questions over the International Sports and Leisure (ISL) affair, which triggered one of Switzerland's biggest criminal fraud cases, and justify the continued presence of the individuals concerned on its executive committee.\n\nOne of the three, Cameroon's Issa Hayatou, who has never been named before in connection with the affair, appears on a detailed list of 175 alleged secret payments, made betweeen 1989 and 1999, from the defunct sports marketing company ISL, routed via a series of front companies in Liechtenstein to top Fifa officials. Hayatou, once seen as a key target for England, was understood to have reacted furiously to the earlier Sunday Times investigation and the three\u2011year suspension handed down to Adamu and will be further angered by the latest allegations.\n\nThe Paraguayan head of the South American football federation, Nicol\u00e1s L\u00e9oz, also on the list, was named in connection with two ISL payments totalling $130,000 during court proceedings in 2008 but Panorama alleged that he received three further payments of $200,000 each. He was lobbied only last week by the England bid team. The payments list shows that a Liechtenstein company, Sanud, received $9.5m. Ricardo Teixeira, head of the Brazilian Football Confederation, the third executive member named, was linked to Sanud by a 2001 Brazilian Senate investigation which found it had secretly channelled money to him.\n\nSix ISL managers were tried in 2008 for misusing company money, but they were not tried for commercial bribery as it was not an offence in Switzerland until 2001.\n\nThe Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, already under fire over the opaque bidding process, declined to comment on the three Fifa executives alleged to have taken bribes.\n\nISL was declared bankrupt in May 2001 but the fallout continued until last June, when the second of two Swiss court cases ended with an agreement to pay \u00a33.5m to settle the case anonymously. At the time Fifa said: \"It is important to recall that the decision was made on matters which took place prior to the year 2000 and that there has been no court conviction against Fifa. In addition, the Fifa president has been cleared of any wrongdoing in this matter.\" Fifa refused to comment tonight.\n\nBBC insiders said that there was a strong public interest rationale in showing the film before the vote took place and that they had been editing it right up until the last minute, having acquired the key document only in recent weeks. Anson insisted that although England were \"underdogs\" he was confident that there was a credible \"path to victory\" as the last\u2011minute lobbying intensified. He reiterated his concerns about Panorama. \"Of course I'm disappointed with the timing and it's certainly not going to win any votes,\" said Anson, who said he would not be watching the programme.\n\n\"It's a reality, it's a small group of 23 people; in a way it"}
{"id": 573, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "by Paul Austin Murphy (October 2016)\n\nLet the UK Independent introduce us to contemporary conspiracy theories. Nick Harding writes:\n\n\"The number of people who believe conspiracy theories is staggering. According to various recent surveys, a third of Brits believe Princess Diana was murdered (a Daily Mail survey), a quarter believe the moon landings were faked (from Engineering and Technology magazine), nearly half of all Americans do not believe global warming is man-made (a Yale University survey) and 84 per cent of them believe 9/11 was an inside job (a New York Times/CBS poll).\"\n\nI must confess to being sceptical about most \u2013 nearly all - conspiracy theories. Relatively sceptical, that is (as will become clear).\n\nTake this very common problem just to begin with. What does the conspiracist do when he discovers that there are various mutually-contradictory theories about the very same conspiracy (as is the case with 9/11, AIDs, J.F. Kennedy, Jack the London Ripper, etc.)?\n\nHowever, it's also the fact that particular conspiracy theories are particularly suited to advance a specific political cause (or justify a political obsession, or confirm already-existing belief/biases/prejudices) that causes me the most problems. Scratch the average political conspiracist for a while and one will often find that he's a thoroughly political animal furthering a specific agenda \u2013 whether of the Right or Left.\n\nThere are also a few \u2013 or many? - conspiracists who quite literally believe all the conspiracy theories they come across. Of course not many people believe all conspiracy theories. Many will believe a couple or even just one.\n\nSo let's think about the term \"conspiracy theory\" itself. Taken literally, these two words shouldn't really be seen as judgemental or critical. If we were to say, \"theories about conspiracies,\" then that would make things clearer. As it is, though, the term is almost always used critically or sarcastically. (I believe one \"conspiracy theory\" in the list above; or, at the least, I partly believe it.)\n\nMitigated Scepticism\n\nThere are at least two books on conspiracy theories which conveniently tackle each conspiracy theory at a time. They also take fairly divergent views on conspiracy theories as a whole; which, in itself, is worth looking into.\n\nThe first book, The Little Book of Conspiracies (by Joel Levy), accepts a degree of truth in many well-known conspiracy theories. The second book, A Rough Guide to Conspiracy Theories (by James McConnachie and Robin Tudge), downplays most of them. Up to a point this is strange because their analyses of conspiracy theories are often similar in style and content. However, the fact that Joel Levy's book has the word 'Conspiracies' in the title, rather than McConnachie and Tudge's 'Theories', partly explains their divergences.\n\nDespite that, even the conspiracy theory sceptics - James McConnachie and Robin Tudge - are more than happy to admit that\n\n\"all too frequently the term 'conspiracy theory' has provided those in power with a convenient way of brushing serious allegations aside, with the result that the official version of events prevails\" (xi).\n\nSo it's clear that even sceptics allow the possibility that at least some conspiracy theories portray the facts. In tandem with this, it's also true that some critics of conspiracy theories (at least in government form) do indeed have a lot to gain from retaining the \"official version\" of events.\n\nThe sceptics McConnachie and Tudge clearly don't accept the theory that all conspiracists are loons who're locked-up in their bedrooms with nothing but a computer to pass the time with. Instead, \"the official version of events is subject to ever-increasing scrutiny\" (xi).\n\nThus, in this day and age, conspiracists \"stoke fear and outrage in the Middle East\". They also \"inspire homespun 'patriot' movements in the US.\" In addition:\n\n\"They make liberal Europeans cynical and apathetic. They influence the politics of the entire Italian nature. They spawn computer games... hip-hop albums... films... and a whole sub-genre of fiction...\" (xi)\n\nSurely amongst all the above there must be at least some truth. Perhaps a lot of truth!\n\nJoel Levy, as I said, tends to be far less sceptical than McConnachie and Tudge. Indeed Kenn Thomas (the editor at Steamshovel Press) says that Levy \"does not embrace every theory as absolute truth, but neither does he dismiss them as total bunk.\" This hints at a progression from conspiracy theories deemed to be \"total bunk\" to those which Levy largely accepts as true (or at least largely true).\n\nWhen it comes to 9/"}

These materials were selected from across the BnF's departments, and include thousands of images for the important collections entitled Hennin and De Vinck. Detailed metadata exists for the images, so that researchers can search by artist, subject, genre, and place.\n\nThe FRDA provides access to the most complete searchable digital archive of French Revolution images available. Images de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise is a benchmark image-base undertaken by the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France on the occasion of the Revolution's bicentennial in 1989. It aimed to \"allow the reader to explore the relationships, articulations and confrontations between the ideas of the Revolution and their metaphorical embodiment, the constant cross-fertilization of ideology and make-believe\u2026\" For this project the BnF created over 38,000 separate views of over 14, 000 individual images, showing closeups and dividing documents with discrete iconographic materials into appropriate sections. The Images, which were originally offered in analog format on laserdisc, had become extremely difficult to access due to rapid technological change. Within the framework of its digitization programs, the BnF rescanned at high resolution almost half of the images on the laserdisc from the original materials. New JPEG files were created from the original videodisc for the remaining images in the corpus. Now all of these images are available online as part of the FRDA.\n\nOver 14,000 image-based items, primarily prints from the Departement des Estampes et de la Photographie, but also illustrations, medals, coins, and other objects, were selected for inclusion from across the BnF's departments. Many originally entered the BnF on legal deposit, but others come from important collections acquired in the 19th and early 20th century. Two of these collections deserve special attention. The collection of Michel Hennin is notable not only for its size, but because it includes many prints omitted from the legal deposit that Hennin amassed during his time in Italy working for the Viceroy, Prince Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais. The print collection of Carl de Vinck, a Belgian diplomat, grew out of his father's infatuation in Marie-Antoinette and expanded to focus more generally on visual representations of France during the century from Marie-Antoinette's marriage to Louis XVI in 1770 until the Paris Commune of 1870.\n\nThe images selected for the digital archive concentrate solely on the period from 1787 through 1799, from the years immediately preceding the outbreak of the Revolution through the emergence of Napoleon.

{"id": 581, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "When a series goes on for as long as Ys has, you'd expect it to have lost steam and lost the magic it was once known for. My time with the Ys franchise started just earlier this month with the re-release of Ys Seven, but I've explored the rest of the series since then and what stuck out to me the most about Ys is that, as time goes on and technology advances, the developers at Falcom have never been afraid to grow and advance the Ys games to keep up. In making these changes and upgrades, they've never lost the core appeal of Ys, the heart of the franchise that has been maintained since even the very first entry into the series.\n\nAfter seven years and a few console generation leaps, Nihon Falcom have delivered the next entry in their flagship action JRPG series. Ys VIII continues the tradition of following the fable-esque journeys of the adventurer Adol Christin. Much like Sinbad the Sailor, every game in the series sees Adol embarking on a fresh adventure in foreign lands, discovering new people, places, and mysteries, all sprinkled with a healthy serving of deadly beasts. The comparison to Sinbad is especially apt with this entry, as Ys VIII sees Adol and his longtime partner Dogi working as sailors and ship-hands on a luxury cruising vessel.\n\nMost Ys games see Adol exploring towns and villages, taking requests from kings, and plenty of other rote JRPG narrative elements. Ys VIII takes a risk with its story by abandoning nearly all of that. As a sailor on The Lombardia, Adol gets a chance to briefly meet all of the passengers onboard before an enormous sea creature attacks the vessel, capsizing it and washing everyone ashore on a mysterious island thought to be a mere legend. From here, Adol and the closest survivors have to juggle tracking down the rest of the passengers, building a settlement to survive on the island, and figuring out how exactly to get off said island. All of this begins to blend in with a series of mysteries and secrets tied to the island itself.\n\nWhile the narrative does eventually build into a grand tale as expected of most Ys experiences, the bulk of the games story is anything but. The setup of a shipwrecked group of strangers trapped on an island together is such a fresh JRPG tale, and it gives way for unique character interactions and personal development that constantly kept me engaged. I was always wondering which passenger I would find next, and getting excited when it seemed like it might be a notable character I met at the beginning. Finding these new passengers always meant not just a new vendor or party member, but a new set of stories and character interactions for me to explore.\n\nMy love for the story also comes from how much the improved visuals and cutscenes help flesh out Adol as a protagonist. Ys VIII is the sharpest looking game in the series by far. Despite some environment details being held back by it being a joint PS4 and Vita release, character models, lighting, and colors all complement each other beautifully. The game runs perfectly on PS4, and while Vita visuals are obviously a bit more pixelated, the framerate and clarity are still top-notch for the system.\n\nAll of these elements feed into the cutscenes of the game wonderfully, most notably the detailed character models. In Ys Seven, I never really got a feeling for Adol's personality or emotions; he had no voice and only rarely gave dialogue responses. In Ys VIII, however, not only does Adol have voice acting sprinkled throughout all his actions, he also has an emotive face and body that characterize him as a veteran adventurer who's been through this kind of thing way too often to be surprised. I felt a lot more invested in him both as a character in the story, and as my personal anchor to this world.\n\nAs interesting and refreshing as the story of Ys VIII is, the gameplay is largely unchanged. Of course, that really isn't a bad thing at all. Ys games have always had fast, frantic, and satisfying real time combat, and it's a tradition that Lacrimosa of Dana only builds on. Like previous games, you have a party of characters who each have different attack styles and attack types. Different enemies have different type weaknesses, and you'll need to switch characters in real time to play to those advantages. Along the way you'll also learn and equip a variety of special moves, which use a replenish-able meter to dish out powerful attacks. There's also a bullet time styled flash dodge/guard system that lets you slow down time and deliver rapid attacks if your timing is just right.\n\nAs you move across the world, exploring dungeons and looking for new survivors or bosses, you'll sometimes be stopped in your tracks by an attack-alert. Enemies will often attack your home base and trigger a tower defence mini-game. While most of the time it's optional, there are a few times when it's a mandatory encounter. Being deep into"}

A surge in U.S. oil production has drastically increased the number of oil trains moving across the continent as pipelines fail to keep up with growing supply.\n\nIn Tuesday's accident, 15 cars and one unmanned locomotive appeared to have derailed, mostly toward the rear of the train, including four loads of propane and four loads of crude oil, said Feeny.\n\n\"At this point, we cannot confirm that they're involved in the fire. They are in the fire area. Because of the fire, emergency responders can't approach too closely,\" he said.\n\nThe train had a total of 122 cars and four locomotives.\n\nFeeny could not say what kind of crude oil the train was carrying and declined to say which customers were involved.\n\nFeeney said CN crews have begun arriving and senior executives were also en route.\n\nFire officials say the cars appear to have been mostly empty except for some propane residue, said Sharon DeWitt, emergency measures coordinator for Plaster Rock.\n\n\"They'll in all probability burn themselves out by morning,\" said DeWitt. \"We'll monitor it.\" She said there is no danger to residents as the wind is blowing away from Plaster Rock, a village of about 1,000 in a mainly wooded area about 50 km (31 miles) from the U.S. border and Maine.\n\nThere have been five major accidents in the past year involving a train carrying crude oil. The most devastating occurred in Quebec in July last year, when a runaway train derailed and exploded in the heart of the town of Lac Megantic, killing 47.\n\nSome U.S. politicians have called for a phase-out or retrofit of old tankers that do not meet current safety standards and are prone to puncture."}

{"id": 586, "ended": true, "length": 552, "text": "By Robert Schlesinger, Thomas Jefferson Street blog As if their current governor and his predecessor have not done enough damage to Texans' reputation for Constitutional acuity, nearly 1 in 3 Texas voters think that their state has the legal right to secede from the Union, according to a new Rasmussen Poll . Umm, no. On the bright side (such as it is), only 1 in 5 Texas voters would actually like to break off from the Union. Fully three quarters of Texas voters are content to remain part of these United States. Gee, thanks. This discussion was sparked by Texas Gov. Rick Perry's assertion that Texas has the unique right to secede from the U.S. of A. (Side question: Why the quiescence of the hyper-patriotic right? Why are they not demanding that Perry love this country or leave it\u2014and reminding him he can't take his state with him?) It is of course an old urban legend that since Texas entered the Union as a sovereign Republic, it has reserved the right to reclaim its old status. Horse-hockey. Two points to consider. First, there's this brief history of the Lone Star State's 1845 entry into the Union, emphasis added:\n\nWhen all attempts to arrive at a formal annexation treaty failed, the United States Congress passed\u2014after much debate and only a simple majority\u2014a Joint Resolution for Annexing Texas to the United States. Under these terms, Texas would keep both its public lands and its public debt, it would have the power to divide into four additional states \"of convenient size\" in the future if it so desired, and it would deliver all military, postal, and customs facilities and authority to the United States government. (Neither this joint resolution or the ordinance passed by the Republic of Texas ' Annexation Convention gave Texas the right to secede.)\n\nThat paragraph comes from what I can only assume to be an authoritative source on the matter: the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. (Tip of my cowboy hat to an old college pal\u2014from Texas\u2014who posted the link on Facebook.)\n\nSecond point: We fought a war over this. Lots of Americans died. The secessionists lost\u2014including the ones in Texas. Secession is no more legal now than it was then.\n\nAnd while talking about secession undoubtedly plays well among the 3 in 10 Texas voters ill-informed enough to think it's a serious political statement, it also makes the rest of the country (and likely the rest of the state) roll our eyes in bewilderment at the Lone Star Clown.\n\nOn Facebook?

By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performance.\n\nQEMU can use other hypervisors like Xen or KVM to use CPU extensions (HVM) for virtualization.

All parameters to run a virtual machine must be specified on the command line at every launch, unless you have created a custom script to start your virtual machine(s).\n\nLibvirt provides a convenient way to manage QEMU virtual machines.

A hard disk image is a file which stores the contents of the emulated hard disk.\n\nA hard disk image can be raw, so that it is literally byte-by-byte the same as what the guest sees, and will always use the full capacity of the guest hard drive on the host. This method provides the least I/O overhead, but can waste a lot of space, as not-used space on the guest cannot be used on the host.\n\nAlternatively, the hard disk image can be in a format such as qcow2 which only allocates space to the image file when the guest operating system actually writes to those sectors on its virtual hard disk. The image appears as the full size to the guest operating system, even though it may take up only a very small amount of space on the host system. This image format also supports QEMU snapshotting functionality (see #Creating and managing snapshots via the monitor console for details). However, using this format instead of raw will likely affect performance.\n\nQEMU provides the qemu-img command to create hard disk images. For example to create a 4 GB image in the raw format:\n\n$ qemu-img create -f raw image_file 4G\n\nYou may use -f qcow2 to create a qcow2 disk instead.\n\nNote: You can also simply create a raw image by creating a file of the needed size using dd or fallocate .\n\nWarning: If you store the hard disk images on a If you store the hard disk images on a Btrfs file system, you should consider disabling Copy-on-Write for the directory before creating any images.\n\nOverlay storage images\n\nYou can create a storage image once (the 'backing' image) and have QEMU keep mutations to this image in an overlay image. This allows you to revert to a previous state of this storage image. You could revert by creating a new overlay image at the time you wish to revert, based on the original backing image.\n\nTo create an overlay image, issue a command like:\n\n$ qemu-img create -o backing_file=img1.raw,backing_fmt=raw -f qcow2 img1.cow\n\nAfter that you can run your QEMU VM as usual (see #Running virtualized system):\n\n$ qemu-system-x86_64 img1.cow\n\nThe backing image will then be left intact and mutations to this storage will be recorded in the overlay image file.\n\nWhen the path to the backing image changes, repair is required.\n\nWarning: The backing image's absolute filesystem path is stored in the (binary) overlay image file"}

Revising the smog alert from \"orange\" down to \"yellow\" in the afternoon, the centre said haze would remain severe in parts of Zhejiang , Jiangsu , Anhui , Shandong , Henan and Hebei provinces until this afternoon.\n\nThe air quality indexes in nearly 80 cities yesterday were above 200, meaning the air was \"heavily\" or \"severely\" polluted.\n\nVideo: Eastern areas of China cloaked in smog\n\nThe country's three city clusters around Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have traditionally been the major victims of episodes of persistent smog. But the pattern has changed, with other inland cities being affected in provinces including Anhui, Hubei , Hunan and Jiangxi , according to Professor Chai Fahe, vice-president of the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences.\n\n\"Locally generated emissions remain the prime cause of the severe smog, but it is exacerbated by the static atmospheric condition that traps the pollutants,\" Chai said.\n\nThe smog in Jiangsu and Zhejiang combined with thick fog yesterday morning. Visibility was reduced to less than 50 metres in the provincial capital of Nanjing and the city maintained its red alert for pollution for the fifth consecutive day.\n\nAbout 250 flights from Hangzhou , Nanjing and Zhengzhou were delayed or cancelled, according to local media reports. Highways were also forced to shut down.\n\nIn Beijing, strong northern winds began to blow away some pollutants. Also, Shanghai's meteorological centre lifted its pollution alert, as the smog \"has considerably lessened\", although the air quality was still rated as \"medium polluted\".\n\nThe city has been among the hardest hit in the recent week by pollution, with the concentration of PM2.5 particulate matter, or tiny particles in the air that are the most hazardous to health, going beyond the index. The Ministry of Environmental Protection said the smog was the result of unfavourable weather conditions, motor vehicle exhausts and coal consumption for heating.\n\nBut most cities are hoping to devise a detailed break down of their local pollution sources, which may still take months to produce, if not years, Chai said.\n\n\"The breakdown is different from region to region and from time to time. Though we do know the general pollution sources, a more detailed breakdown will make pollution treatment measures more efficient.\"\n\nFor instance, the burning of corn stalks in the Yangtze River Delta was blamed by some as a major cause of this round of smog, but there is no detailed data available yet of how much the practice has contributed.\n\n\"We must face up to the realities,\" said Yan Naiqiang, a professor of environmental science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. \"The treatment of smog will be a long battle.\""}

In the late '80s and early '90s the big N's brand, particularly in North America, was ever-present and dominant in the market. Mario and his fellow mascots had TV shows, cereal brands, toys and assorted paraphernalia all over store shelves. If you grew up in that era and lived in an area fully infiltrated by the Kyoto-based company, you may recall that brand Mario and Nintendo were constantly seizing attention.\n\nNintendo's still a major brand, let's not forget. You can say Mario to a gamer of almost any age and they'll still likely think of Nintendo right away \u2014 a personal experience of this writer was of various mushroom-related puns being thrown my way when unconvincingly taking on a 10km run dressed as Mario, and young kids offering high-fives once they spotted the outfit. When two tired runners are slumped on the grass and three young kids and a dad ask for a picture, you know the brand lives on.\n\nYet the brand power, which is judged more on cold hard facts such as sales in the millions, is weaker now than in previous golden eras. If the Wii and DS period represents a recent triumph, it's not been enough to maintain the Nintendo brand at stratospheric levels to generate 'Nintendo-like' profits in the last few years \u2014 far from it. The Wii Sports and Wii Fit concepts that so enraptured a generation have struggled to make a meaningful impact in the Wii U era, likewise Brain Age on 3DS. The struggles of these titles to maintain interest can arguably be attributed to strategic errors from Nintendo, undoubtedly, as well as factors such as the rise of inexpensive smart device games (in the case of Brain Age) that are easily accessible elsewhere.\n\nIn any case, the limited relevance of those 'new' brands has been telling for both the Wii U and 3DS; in the case of the former, there's now huge pressure on Mario Kart 8, for example, as the latest entry in a series that has delivered the goods throughout its entire history. Nintendo, out of necessity, also has an eye on the long term, and that's where its announcement and early details on the Nintendo Figurine Platform (NFP) come into play.\n\nWhile Nintendo may or may not be kicking itself over a rejected Wii exclusivity deal with the first Skylanders game, it's been facing calls to dive into the collectible toy / video game market for a sustained period. Activision's business may be diverse, but its mature audience monster profits come from Call of Duty while the Skylanders brand covers gamers of various ages. We've complained that, technically, this collectible toy / video game model is actually exploitative on-disc DLC \u2014 the NFC (near field communication) toys of Skylanders and the more recent Disney Infinity are made up of primitive, inexpensive technology. When you pop a toy on a portal a basic chip is read and interpreted by the disc, with the majority of data and all of the gameplay simply unlocked on the disc; it's not black magic or actually impressive on a technical level.\n\nThe counter-argument, which is absolutely fair, is simply \"who cares\"? Both these brands are now huge business, exciting not just kids but 'big kids' of all ages \u2014 the simple act of having a neat toy for your shelf that also interacts with a game is a classic example of an obvious idea well executed. Perhaps it's surprising that it's become such a massive market considering the cost to supposedly money-aware consumers, but that's where we are, and most importantly for both brands it gives the games shelf space that others can only dream of. Game stores and various other kinds of retailers have starter kits, disc copies and rows upon rows of collectible toys to be bought individually. That means big money, but also invaluable exposure and what's often described as 'mind share'.\n\nIt's that retail presence where Nintendo's influence has perhaps waned the most. To be doom-and-gloom and suggest the trend is irreversible is foolish, however, and ignoring the impact of the Wii as opposed to the struggles of the GameCube. Nintendo's Figurine Platform also comes in behind two established brands, yet we suspect retailers that still stock some Mario plushes and Nintendo Monopoly will take a very real interest, provided stock levels and marketing are up to scratch from Nintendo. Nintendo's character IPs are still popular, but they need a fresh outlet just like this.\n\nWhat may tempt parents, or us older fans that have limited budgets, is the early assurance that Nintendo's approach may not be quite as generational as that of Skylanders and Disney Infinity, which gradually phases out older toys and portals with ever-more elaborate new designs.

It follows from the axioms above in two steps:\n\n1) Any element $a$ with the property $aa = a$ [i.e. idempotent] must be equal to the identity $e$ in the axioms, since in that case:\n\n$$a = ae = a(aa^{-1}) = (aa)a^{-1} = aa^{-1} = e$$\n\nThis already proves the uniqueness of the [right] identity, since any identity by definition has the property of being idempotent.\n\n2) By the axioms, for every element $a$ there is at least one right inverse element $a^{-1}$ such that $aa^{-1}=e$. Now we form the product of the same two elements in reverse order, namely $a^{-1}a$, to see if that product also equals the identity. If so, this right inverse is also a left inverse. We only need to show that $a^{-1}a$ is idempotent, and then its equality to $e$ follows from step 1:\n\n$$[a^{-1}a][ a^{-1}a] = a^{-1}(a a^{-1})a = a^{-1}ea = a^{-1}a $$\n\n3) It is now clear that the right identity is also a left identity.

Love the decor, the music, he staff was friendly. 2) came in for brunch. It's $25 for brunch or $30 if you get he steak and eggs (filet mignon). And $15 for bottomless mimosas. 3) The all you can east dessert/ pastries was just okay. I only kept eating because or food took FOREVER. 4) I was going to order the beef cheeks because they seems delicious. Our server John however recommend the special, described as tri tip, with potatoes, eggs any style, and black been pur\u00e9e. I chose the special \"beef mid rare and eggs opposite, over hard; please no wet yolk.\" 5) the food came (for a table of 9) about 5-7 minutes apart 2 plates at a time. My meat was medium not mid rare. It was warm, not hot. The potatoes were more of a hash and it was sparse to say the least. The black bean pur\u00e9e was COLD, literally just cold. Not sure if it was supposed to be served that way, but it was... so I ate it. The eggs came separately and they had runny yolk. I sent them back, they came back in about 2 minutes the exact same way. Mind you other guest still have not gotten their meal. Because my meal was already cold I just ate because I didn't want it to get colder. The flavors were there. Like exceptional. If it wasn't cold I would have really enjoyed it. Tri tip had this perfectly seasoned crust on it. Pur\u00e9e had a hint of spice. Little bit of micro greens with the potatoes and the flavors all blended really well. Finally after everyone's food had come and been eaten they brought my eggs. The were so over done it was like chalk, I felt like the chef was thinking \"I'll show you over hard!\" Lol. Whatever. Eggs are something that should be made to order and they are the least difficult to make, so just make them how the guest ask. 6) we get are check and I was charged extra for my special. At no point did our server let us know that it was extra for the special. When we asked he said it was because the special was a variation of the steak and eggs. Which was not explained initially. Tri tip and filet mignon are no where near the same price so why would I be charged more? It just seemed dishonest to me. Especially when you are charged $25 regardless. My husband got the Pop breakfast (bacon, eggs, potatoes), even with the \"buffet\" not worth $25 bucks. 7) My sister in law got the mushroom scramble and her food too the longest to come out! A full 10 minutes after mine. Not to mention again it was just scrambled eggs with mushrooms. Not worth the $25. IMO if you are only gonna have 8 items on the menu I feel they should all be impeccable as well worth it.\n\nThis was a good experience! we did the dine LA 3 course. And it was good - Tuna tartar which was amazing! -chicken champagne which was also great. -sorbet was alright -and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was pretty great!

Not sure why the star count is so low! Came here the other night with bae for our anniversary.

The partnership, which was expected, gives Apple much greater access to the world's largest mobile market, with an estimated 1.2 billion users. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, and iPhone pricing details will be released at a later date. China Mobile is the world's largest wireless carrier with 760 million subscribers.\n\nTo put that in perspective, that's more than three times the number of U.S. users who subscribe to mobile services offered by AT&T and Verizon Wireless \u2014 combined. The China Mobile deal is very important for Apple because the company's growth rate in the U.S., its biggest market, has been slowing lately. The iPhone has been available on smaller carriers in China for years, but sales have faced pressure in the face of lower-cost competition from devices made by Samsung and other manufacturers that use Google's Android mobile operating system.\n\nAnalysts estimate that Apple could sell between 20 million and 30 million iPhones on China Mobile's network next year. That would effectively double the number of iPhones it sold in the country in 2013. Colin W. Gillis, a technology analyst at BGC Financial, said in a recent research note to clients that the China Mobile iPhone launch is one of the last remaining short-term catalysts that could propel Apple shares substantially higher. As 2013 draws to a close, Apple's stock price is essentially flat for the year, although the shares have soared 33% in the past six months, reversing steep losses in the first half of the year.\n\n(MORE: How BlackBerry Went From World's Hottest Tech Company to a Punch Line)\n\nIn a joint statement, Apple and China Mobile said the iPhone 5s and 5c models will go on sale in Apple and China Mobile stores beginning Jan. 17. China Mobile customers can preregister for phones starting Dec. 25. \"Apple's iPhone is very much loved by millions of customers around the world,\" said Xi Guohua, chairman of China Mobile. \"We know there are many China Mobile customers and potential new customers who are anxiously awaiting the incredible combination of iPhone on China Mobile's leading network.\"\n\nChina Mobile is in the process of building the world's largest 4G network, which refers to the latest generation of high-speed mobile broadband access. The companies said the iPhone on China Mobile's platform will support the carrier's 4G/TD-LTE and 3G/TD-SCDMA networks. By the end of 2013, China Mobile's 4G services will be available in 16 Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. By the end of 2014, China Mobile said it plans to complete the rollout of more than 500,000 4G base stations, which will cover more than 340 cities with 4G service.\n\n\"Apple has enormous respect for China Mobile, and we are excited to begin working together,\" said Apple CEO Tim Cook. \"China is an extremely important market for Apple, and our partnership with China Mobile presents us the opportunity to bring iPhone to the customers of the world's largest network. iPhone customers in China are an enthusiastic and rapidly growing group, and we can't think of a better way to welcome in the Chinese New Year than getting an iPhone into the hands of every China Mobile customer who wants one.\"\n\n(MORE: NSA Spying Scandal Could Cost U.S. Tech Giants Billions)\n\nApple's deal with China Mobile is a major coup for Cook, who has faced pressure from some Wall Street analysts and shareholders over a perceived lack of innovation at the company since the death of his mentor, revered Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Those concerns are probably overblown \u2014 the latest iPhone and iPad models feature impressive improvements and have been a huge hit with customers. This year Apple will likely enjoy the most lucrative holiday quarter in its history. The company expects holiday sales between $55 billion and $58 billion, which is at the high end of Wall Street expectations.\n\nBut the fact remains that under Cook's tenure, Apple has yet to introduce a category-busting new product on the scale of the original iPod, iPhone or iPad. Analysts are hoping to see a groundbreaking new TV product over the next year, or possibly a wearable computing device like the long-rumored Apple iWatch. New markets and new products will be crucial if Apple is to accelerate its growth. Last quarter, Apple's net profit declined from the same period last year, when the company posted net profit of $8.2 billion. And sales only ticked up slightly from $36 billion during the same period last year.\n\nChina represents a potential financial bonanza for Apple for at least four reasons.

Okay, it is, but the two processes have some similarities, and 3D printing company Nano Dimension believes that it can span these two wildly different fields and usher in a new era of both electronics manufacturing and medicine.\n\nA concept rendering of Nano Dimension's bioprinter. (Image courtesy of Nano Dimension.)\n\nThe NASDAQ-traded Israeli firm (NASDAQ:NNDM) recently announced that it would be entering into the miraculous world of bioprinting through a new subsidiary. To learn how Nano Dimension could add bioprinting technology to its existing business of 3D printing printed circuit boards (PCBs), ENGINEERING.com spoke to the company's CEO, Amit Dror. Afterward, the two technologies didn't seem quite as disparate as one might think.\n\n3D Printing PCBs\n\nNano Dimension just brought its DragonFly 2020 PCB 3D Printer to market last year. The system relies on an inkjetting technology to dispense a UV-curable photopolymer, as the dielectric material, and silver nanoparticles, as the conductive material, to 3D print rigid PCBs layer by layer.\n\nThe DragonFly 2020 printer's first six customers have been some pretty big ones. \"Some of our customers are among the top 10 defense companies in the U.S. and Fortune 100 consumer products manufacturers. We even have one of the top 10 banks as a customer,\" Dror pointed out.\n\nThe DragonFly 2020 3D Printer is capable of producing multi-layered PCBs, saving companies time and money through in-house prototyping. (Image courtesy of Nano Dimension.)\n\nAs we learned in an interview with Nano Dimension CBO Simon Fried, the company has demonstrated its platform to be quite flexible, regularly reporting research that it has conducted into new materials. For instance, the latest release from the company explains that it has received a grant, in collaboration with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, to develop a method for 3D printing ceramic materials. This could potentially make it possible, according to Nano Dimension, to fabricate PCBs with superior properties than existing PCBs, due to the insulation and mechanical strength of ceramics.\n\nOther advances include the ability to 3D print flexible PCBs, on a next-generation system, and embed electronics directly into PCBs as they are being printed. Dror explained that this was achieved by pausing the printing process midway through, dropping in an electronic component, such as a CPU, and finishing the print. Dror believes that it will be increasingly possible to 3D print complex, free-form shapes, so that PCBs won't be constrained to flat circuit boards, but can have more unique geometries.\n\n\"It's really a new approach to how things could be made,\" Dror said. \"Think about what could be achieved if you take all of these elements [like flexible PCBs and embedded electronics] and use them in order to create all kinds of products for the Internet of Things or customized parts or specialty parts for the space industry or other industries where there is a need to miniaturize elements, for example.\"\n\nBut how does this inkjetting technology port over to bioprinting, which uses organic matter instead of polymers and conductive inks?\n\nFrom NanoDimension to BioDimension\n\n\"It started with an experiment,\" Dror said. \"Basically, we worked with [Accellta Ltd.], which approached us to see if we could help them with printing\u2014or, more importantly, very accurate printing\u2014stem cells as a test to try to create tissue.\"\n\nThe company has about 90 employees, including those with PhDs in chemistry, mechanical engineering and software, but lacks experience with biological material. Dror added, \"We thought at that time, 'what do we know about bio?'\"\n\nWhat the company does have, however, is expertise in combining different materials. And that's where Nano Dimension began to see the similarities between 3D printing PCBs and organic matter. \"Think about it. What's a tissue? It's a set of cells made up mostly different cell types, placed together in an orderly manner. They might have some other materials combining them or holding them in one way or another. These materials could be proteins or other structural and connective elements. One tissue might be soft, while another could be firm. Together, different tissues form an organ.\"\n\nIn other words, from a general perspective, organic tissue is simply a combination of different co-located materials, much like a 3D-printed PCB. Obviously, there are huge dissimilarities between the two, but this was enough to give Nano Dimension the confidence to pursue the project.\n\nNano Dimension's labs facility.

(Photo: Michael Dwyer/AP).\n\nOn the last Tuesday in September, an important deadline loomed for the men and women who would be president. The Federal Election Commission requires those running for office to report how much their campaigns have raised each quarter, and the last-minute fundraising appeals that ensue often reach a dramatic pitch as politicians seek to raise a figure that proves they have staying power.\n\nStarting at about 9:30 p.m. that evening, online donations through Sen. Bernie Sanders's website, store and the ActBlue fundraising site reached the phenomenal clip of about two contributions per second. They stayed at that high and steady pace until the clock struck midnight. When all was said and done, online fundraising efforts like this helped the campaign raise a whopping $26 million for the quarter \u2014 just $2 million fewer than Democratic primary frontrunner and establishment favorite Hillary Clinton.\n\nSanders also reported more than 1 million contributions \u2014 more even than Barack Obama had pulled in during the early part of his groundbreaking 2008 presidential run. It was a major milestone for the Vermont senator's Cinderella story campaign, proving he has both the voter base and the financial wherewithal to compete with Clinton.\n\nIf Sanders's record-setting number of donors served as a wake-up call to establishment Democrats about the strength of the insurgent Sanders campaign, it was no surprise to those inside his operation.\n\nSince May, a small guerilla-marketing team whose members have been part of some of the most successful insurgent campaigns in the Democratic Party have been working to translate grassroots enthusiasm for Sanders into dollars.\n\nAt its helm is Scott Goodstein, a former music marketer who made a living hyping bands like Korn prior to his political career. In 2007, after \"drinking beers and talking\" with Obama's main digital strategist at the time, he and his friend, videographer Arun Chaudhary, were hired by the famously innovative campaign to help create a groundswell of support online and in local communities.\n\nIn 2009, after Obama's election, Goodstein took everything he learned from the campaign and launched Revolution Messaging , bringing on a \"lean-and-mean\" group of digital marketing veterans to help. Tim Tagaris, who cut his teeth on Sen. Chris Murphy's successful campaign against Republican Linda McMahon, and on Ned Lamont's netroots -fueled fight against one-time Democratic vice presidential nominee and incumbent Sen.

Chaudhary joined up after leaving the White House, where he had been Obama's first videographer.\n\nSince July, Revolution Messaging has been tasked with overseeing social media, online fundraising, web design and digital advertising for Sanders, sending a steady stream of text messages, emails and issue-based ads urging supporters to donate or volunteer. The team also nurtures and helps grow the communities on Sanders's already popular Facebook and Reddit pages.\n\n\"After seeing the immediate response the first few hours after [Sanders] said that he was running for president, nothing would surprise me,\" Tagaris, who heads up the email fundraising team for Sanders, told Yahoo News after the third quarter fundraising numbers were revealed.\n\nThe effort is not all that different from the scrappy, ultra-efficient operation that Goodstein and many members of his current workforce ran for Obama's campaign in 2008. But to equate the two campaigns is to overlook both the way Internet use has evolved over the past eight years, and the unique personality of Sanders as a candidate.\n\nSince the 2008 election, the economy has migrated to Internet-based services, the mobile industry has exploded and a generation of young people weaned on the art of personal branding is more skeptical of pandering than ever. It's these pivotal changes in the digital world and the people who live in it that explain Sanders's appeal and the passionate response his campaign has been enjoying.\n\nView photos"}

', said: \"Travel times would be the same, if not shorter through the creation of a busway system.\n\n\"For shorter journeys especially, express coaches would deliver travel speeds similar to that of trains as well as operating more frequently.\"\n\nIt added: \"Converting commuter railways into busways would bring about cheaper fares for passengers, as operating and infrastructure costs would be much lower.\n\n\"Although the initial cost of conversion would be substantial, adding new rail capacity and continuing rail subsidies would be far more expensive.\"\n\nRichard Wellings, the report's co-author and the IEA's Head of Transport said: \"Ongoing interference by politicians in the rail industry has led to everyone getting a raw deal.\n\n\"Passengers face increasingly expensive fares only to fight their way onto trains during peak times and taxpayers continue to prop up an industry whose importance to the country is disproportionally small relative to the level of resources it receives.\n\n\"Adopting more efficient methods of transport could offer considerable benefits to passengers and the taxpayer alike.\n\n\"But only when the sector is liberalised from rigid state control, will we see such alternatives being seriously considered.\"\n\nThe report also found that the financial support received by the rail industry was \"disproportional to its importance to travellers\".\n\nIt said: \"Individuals in the UK are far more likely to travel by car than train, with 90 per cent of passengers and 70 per cent of freight traffic carried by roads.\n\n\"Despite this disparity, state funding of railways is just 30 per cent lower than that spent on roads.\"\n\nA Department for Transport spokesman said: \"We have no plans to replace rail routes with express busways.\n\n\"As part of our long-term economic plan, \u00a338bn will be invested in the rail network over the next five years because it is the most economically effective way of transporting large numbers of passengers.\n\n\"Fares have an important role to play in this investment, but we recognise passengers' concerns about the cost of travel. That is why we have frozen regulated fares at inflation for the second year in a row.\""}

Taylor\n\nIn an ironic display of white supremacy, Black residents in the historically African American East Oakland area are now being treated as menaces by white invading gentrifiers who are calling the cops on them for simply living life as they always have. A recent report by the East Bay Express reveals that the rate at which whites are calling police on innocent blacks is skyrocketing at an alarming rate.\n\nUsing data from the website Nextdoor.com, the publication was able to uncover cops being called for such harmless infractions as walking down the street and knocking on a door. Black salesman and postal workers who were simply doing their job have even faced harassment and been criminalized just for delivering items to residents.\n\nAs if existing Oakland police officers do not have a history of criminalizing and brutalizing Black residents enough, white residents have also taken to hiring private officers to patrol the neighborhood with even more tyranny. Oakland officers report that they are currently receiving more than 700 calls a month about suspicious vehicles and people, revealing that they are forced to respond to baseless, unwarranted calls from white residents who are racially profiling their neighbors.\n\nAs gentrification reverses white flight across the country, Black people are being subjected to racial profiling and white supremacy at the hands of invading white gentrifiers whose racial biases will continue unabated until there are some kind of legal repercussions for their harassment. Black residents are being forced to relocate by rising property taxes and the shattered tranquility of homes that are no longer the vibrant cultural centers they once were, and city officials are doing little to address the problem.\n\nMeanwhile, drummers who have a long tradition of playing music at Lake Merritt recently had police called on them by white residents, and Oakland police bowed to the man's wishes, sending a large number of officers to handle a peaceful situation and pass out citations to a group of residents who were simply enjoying their neighborhood as they always had.\n\nA local Oakland church even had police called on them for a noise complaint about loud singing. In an extreme display of arrogance, white invading gentrifiers do not even hold any respect for allowing Black residents to worship in their sacred spaces without being subjected to white supremacy. Long time Oakland resident and publisher of the Black newspaper the Oakland Post reveals even more about how bold white newcomers are in reporting that young white residents and realtors have even knocked on his door inquiring about buying his home and having the nerve to asked him when he is leaving, implying that he is in the way.\n\nHigh school freshman James Fisher recently spoke with the East Bay Express about the suspicious and fearful stares he gets from white people, making him feel out of place and uncomfortable in the only place he has ever called home. As gentrification continues to spread across the country, Black residents everywhere, not just in Oakland, are left to wonder if they will every be able to call any place in America home without white people having the right to invade and pilfer their neighborhoods and communities.\n\nSOURCE"}

{"id": 624, "ended": true, "length": 839, "text": "I recently noticed that Sarah Sharp resigned publicly from the kernel giving a failure to impose a mandatory code of conduct as the reason and citing interaction problems, mainly on the mailing lists. The net result of this posting, as all these comments demonstrate, is to imply directly that nothing has ever changed. This implication is incredibly annoying, firstly because it is actually untrue, secondly because it does more to discourage participation than the behaviour that is being complained about and finally because it totally disrespects and ignores the efforts of hundreds of people who, over the last decade or so, have been striving to improve all interactions around Linux \u2026 a rather nice irony given that \"respect\" is listed as one of the issues for the resignation. I'd just like to remind everyone of the history of these efforts and what the record shows they've achieved.\n\nThe issue of respect on the Mailing lists goes way back to the beginnings of Linux itself, but after the foundation of the OSDL (precursor to the Linux Foundation) Technical Advisory Board (TAB), one of its first issues from OSDL member companies was the imbalance between Asian and European/American contributions to the kernel. The problems were partly to do with Management culture and partly because the lack of respect on the various mailing lists was directly counter to the culture of respect in a lot of Asian countries and disproportionately discouraged contributions from that region. The TAB largely works behind the scenes, but some aspects of the effort filtered into the public domain as can be seen with a session on developer relations at the 2007 kernel summit (and, in fact, at a lot of other kernel summits since then). Progress was gradual, and influenced by a large number of people, but the climate did improve. I have to confess that I don't follow LKML (not because of the flame war issues, simply because it's too much of a firehose); however, the lists I do participate in (linux-scsi, linux-ide, linux-mm, linux-fsdevel, linux-efi, linux-arch, linux-parisc) haven't seen any flagrantly disrespectful and personally insulting posts for several years now. Indeed, when an individual came along who could almost have been flame bait for this with serial efforts to get incorrect and badly thought out patches into the kernel (I won't give cites here to avoid stigmatising individuals) they met with a large reserve of patience and respectful and helpful advice before finally being banned from the lists for being incorrigible \u2026 no insults or flames at all.\n\nAlthough I'd love to take credit for some of this, I've got to say that I think the biggest influencer towards civility is actually the \"professionalisation\" of Linux: Employers pay people to work on Linux but the statements of those people become identified with their employers (no matter how many disclaimers they have) \u2026 in many ways, Open Source engineers are the new corporate spokespeople. All employers bear this in mind when they hire and they certainly look over the mailing lists to see how people behave. The net result is really that the only people who can afford to be rude or abusive are those who don't think they have much chance of a long term career in Linux.\n\nSo, by and large, I'm proud of the achievements we've made in civility and the way we have improved over the years. Are we perfect? by no means (but then perfection in such a large community isn't a realistic goal). However, we have passed our stress test: that an individual with bad patches to several mailing lists was met with courtesy and helpful advice, in spite of serially repeating the behaviour.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd just like to note that even the thread that gave rise to Sarah's desire to pursue a code of conduct is now over two years old and try as they might, no-one's managed to come up with a more recent example and no-one has actually invoked the voluntary code of conflict, which was the compromise for not having a mandatory code of conduct. If it were me, I'd actually take that as a sign of success \u2026"}

But also that's not unfortunate because it really holds its own and has very unique (and awesome) characters. Still has the wit and humor in it that I love about Rat Queens though, and the dialogue is on point. You may be wondering why I gave it only 3 stars, seeing as how I have only good things to say about it and, WELL, I think I just don't like space. LOL. I enjoy fantasy settings and plots way way way more, I'm just not as into space guns and spaceships and space-things.Not for me.

Actually, their relationship is probably one of my favorite things about this comic. The dialogue between them is kinda sexy and fun at the same time, and I like how their relationship is interwoven into the plot. ALSO. Major diversity points!, and I particularly liked how the female body was depicted. Each female character was a unique representation of physical female performativity, and of course that only added to my enjoyment of the story.Definitely check this one out if you're a sci-fi fan.

{"id": 629, "ended": true, "length": 664, "text": "Netflix remains the biggest road hog on broadband highways \u2014 but its overall share of peak-period Internet traffic actually declined slightly over the past six months in North America. And that may be partly due to gains by Amazon, Netflix's chief rival in the subscription VOD space.\n\nIn March 2016, Netflix represented 35.2% of downstream traffic on North American fixed networks during primetime hours, according to a study by network-equipment provider Sandvine. That's compared with 37.1% six months ago for the world's No. 1 streaming-video service, and down from 36.5% a year ago.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean people are streaming less Netflix video. The decline in traffic share, according to Sandvine's analysis, most likely stems from the company's recent improvements in video-encoding efficiency. Last December, Netflix detailed changes in its video-encoding schemes, which the company said could reduce bit rates by up to 20% while delivering equivalent quality.\n\nBut part of Netflix's decline in share of bandwidth consumption may be because of a big jump in usage attributed to Amazon: This spring, Amazon Video accounted for 4.3% of peak downstream traffic, a significant gain from 2% on Sandvine's report a year ago. Like Netflix, Amazon made optimizations to its video compression in early 2016.\n\nRelated Inside Netflix's Plan to Boost Streaming Quality and Unclog the Internet\n\nIn addition, YouTube also gained share, holding second place on Sandvine's report with 17.5% share of downstream bandwidth consumed during peak periods (compared with 15.6% last year), as did Hulu with 2.7% this spring (up from 1.9%). The study found a decline in total share of web-browser traffic, which fell from 6% a year ago to 4.2%, and iTunes, which dropped from 3.4% to 2.9%.\n\nNote that Sandvine's studies don't report actual bandwidth usage: They compare only relative share of bits delivered over Internet service providers' networks. So it's possible that Netflix's total hours of video streamed actually has increased over the last six months while its content uses less bandwidth.\n\nMeanwhile, Dish Network's Sling TV now appears among the top 20 applications on most U.S. broadband networks, but it still accounts for less than 1% of peak-period traffic, according to Sandvine. The company defines \"peak period\" as 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.\n\nOverall, streaming audio and video now accounts for 71% of primetime traffic across North American fixed-access broadband networks \u2014 and is expected to increase to 80% by 2020, per Sandvine. The data for Sandvine's latest report was collected from multiple ISPs in March 2016.\n\nBitTorrent, which in 2008 represented 31% of total Internet traffic, continues to shrink as a percentage of overall bandwidth usage. In March, the file-sharing app accounted for 2.9% of total peak-period traffic (both upstream and downstream) in North America, according to Sandvine, and 5% of total traffic during the day. Storage applications like Dropbox, Apple's iCloud and Google Drive have surpassed BitTorrent in upstream traffic on fixed networks."}

A Temple is considered, by the LDS Church to be the house of the Lord and one of the holiest places on earth. Ceremonies or \"ordinances\" held at the temple carry profound theological significance to Mormons, who believe as a tenet of their faith that only the worthy may be admitted. Only the most devout members of the applicant Church, who hold a current \"recommend\", are entitled to enter the temples. According to para 7 of the Judgment the right to enter a Temple is explained by the Church as follows: \"WORTHY TO ENTER You must possess a current recommend to be admitted to the temple ... Only those who are worthy should go to the temple ... The interview for a temple recommend is conducted privately between the bishop and the Church member concerned. Here the member is asked searching questions about his or her personal conduct, worthiness and loyalty to the Church and its officers. The person must certify that he is morally clean and keeping the Word of Wisdom, paying a full tithing [approximately 10% of income to be paid to the Church], living in harmony with the teachings of the Church and not maintaining any affiliation or sympathy with apostate groups ... THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING A TEMPLE RECOMMEND IS A BLESSING\" The standards required in order to be granted a recommend include honesty, eschewing abusive conduct, attention to family duties, marital fidelity, the adoption of healthy lifestyle practices and, for divorcees, full compliance with support orders and other legal obligations . The specific case concerned the temple at Preston, where congregational services are attended by on average 950 people a week. Under the Local Government Finance Act 1988, a valuation officer must compile and maintain a local rating list for his or her area. Premises included on the list are liable for the payment of business rates. Premises used for charitable purposes are entitled to charity business rates relief, which cuts the amount of rates payable by 80%. Places of \"public religious worship\" are wholly exempt from the tax. In 1998 the Preston temple was listed as a building used for charitable purpose and therefore retained a liability to pay only 20% rates, but it was refused the statutory tax exemption reserved for places of \"public religious worship\". Other buildings of the Church such as its various Chapels are open to the public and attract the normal 100% rates relief. On 5 March 2001 the Church applied to have the temple removed from the rating list, claiming the benefit of the exemption for places of \"public religious worship\". On 21 October 2004 the Lancashire Valuation Tribunal granted the application for appeal and determined the temple to be exempt under the statutory provision. On 14 December 2005 the Lands Tribunal overturned that decision. The Church appealed unsuccessfully to the Court of Appeal and then appealed to the House of Lords. In that hearing Gallagher (Valuation Officer) v. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints [2008] UKHL 56 the Church argued for the first time that refusal of Rates Relief amounted to a breach of Article 9 but the House of Lords unanimously dismissed the appeal holding, on the basis of an earlier judgment ( Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Henning [1964] AC 420 ), that as a matter of domestic law a place of \"public religious worship\" must be one that was open to the general public. (NB: The Henning case had concerned the other LDS Temple in Surrey) The Government in its arguments to the ECHR did not accept that the LDS Church was in any different position in relation to the 1988 Act than any other religious organisation. The rule was of general application and concerned only the use made of the building; it did not discriminate on the basis of religious belief. Any of the Mormon places of worship, such as chapels and stake centres, that were open to the public, had the benefit of rates the exemption. The Government pointed out as an example that where Church of England churches were run by closed orders or as college chapels which were not open to the public they too did not get rates relief, The LDS Church put in a very interesting argument summarised in para 21 of the judgment Temple worship, by its very nature as understood by its believers, required that only those who voluntarily lived by the kinds of commitments made in the temple should be allowed to participate. This was not a case of worship being made private for the purposes of being exclusive or to provide private benefit; it was because the very nature of the worship as understood by its believers required privacy to promote the sacred character of the worship.

Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321 .\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\nMORSE et al. v. FREDERICK\n\ncertiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n\nAt a school-sanctioned and school-supervised event, petitioner Morse, the high school principal, saw students unfurl a banner stating \"BONG HiTS 4 JESUS,\" which she regarded as promoting illegal drug use. Consistent with established school policy prohibiting such messages at school events, Morse directed the students to take down the banner. When one of the students who had brought the banner to the event\u2014respondent Frederick\u2014refused, Morse confiscated the banner and later suspended him. The school superintendent upheld the suspension, explaining, inter alia, that Frederick was disciplined because his banner appeared to advocate illegal drug use in violation of school policy. Petitioner school board also upheld the suspension. Frederick filed suit under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, alleging that the school board and Morse had violated his First Amendment rights. The District Court granted petitioners summary judgment, ruling that they were entitled to qualified immunity and that they had not infringed Frederick's speech rights. The Ninth Circuit reversed. Accepting that Frederick acted during a school-authorized activity and that the banner expressed a positive sentiment about marijuana use, the court nonetheless found a First Amendment violation because the school punished Frederick without demonstrating that his speech threatened substantial disruption. It also concluded that Morse was not entitled to qualified immunity because Frederick's right to display the banner was so clearly established that a reasonable principal in Morse's position would have understood that her actions were unconstitutional.\n\nHeld: Because schools may take steps to safeguard those entrusted to their care from speech that can reasonably be regarded as encouraging illegal drug use, the school officials in this case did not violate the First Amendment by confiscating the pro-drug banner and suspending Frederick. Pp. 5\u201315.\n\n(a) Frederick's argument that this is not a school speech case is rejected. The event in question occurred during normal school hours and was sanctioned by Morse as an approved social event at which the district's student-conduct rules expressly applied. Teachers and administrators were among the students and were charged with supervising them. Frederick stood among other students across the street from the school and directed his banner toward the school, making it plainly visible to most students. Under these circumstances, Frederick cannot claim he was not at school. Pp. 5\u20136.\n\n(b) The Court agrees with Morse that those who viewed the banner would interpret it as advocating or promoting illegal drug use, in violation of school policy. At least two interpretations of the banner's words\u2014that they constitute an imperative encouraging viewers to smoke marijuana or, alternatively, that they celebrate drug use\u2014demonstrate that the sign promoted such use. This pro-drug interpretation gains further plausibility from the paucity of alternative meanings the banner might bear. Pp. 6\u20138.\n\n(c) A principal may, consistent with the First Amendment , restrict student speech at a school event, when that speech is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use. In Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503 , the Court declared, in holding that a policy prohibiting high school students from wearing antiwar armbands violated the First Amendment , id., at 504, that student expression may not be suppressed unless school officials reasonably conclude that it will \"materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school,\" id., at 513. The Court in Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U. S. 675 , however, upheld the suspension of a student who delivered a high school assembly speech employing \"an elaborate, graphic, and explicit sexual metaphor,\" id., at 678. Analyzing the case under Tinker, the lower courts had found no disruption, and therefore no basis for discipline. 478 U. S., at 679\u2013680. This Court reversed, holding that the school was \"within its permissible authority in imposing sanctions \u2026 in response to [the student's] offensively lewd and indecent speech.\" Id., at 685. Two basic principles may be distilled from Fraser. First, it demonstrates that \"the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings.\" Id., at 682. Had Fraser delivered the same speech in a public forum outside the school context, he would have been protected. See, id., at 682\u2013683. In school, however, his"}

REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nU.S. District Judge Denise Cote said the plaintiffs had \"more than met their burden\" to allow them to sue as a group. She rejected Apple's contentions that the claims were too different from each other, or that some plaintiffs were not harmed because some e-book prices fell.\n\n\"This is a paradigmatic antitrust class action,\" wrote Cote, who has scheduled a trial later this year to determine damages, which could reach hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nIn July 2013, Cote found the technology company liable for colluding with the publishers after a separate non-jury trial in a case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. Cote found that Apple took part in a price-fixing conspiracy to fight online retailer Amazon.com Inc's dominance in the e-book market.\n\nApple is appealing that decision.\n\nThirty-three states and U.S. territories have separately sued on behalf of their consumers, while individual consumers in other states and territories filed the class action lawsuit that Cote addressed on Friday.

In a separate ruling, Cote largely threw out the opinions of Apple's two damages experts, saying they were not based on \"rigorous application of economic methods.\"\n\nSteve Berman of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, the plaintiffs' lead lawyer, said, \"We are thrilled with the win.\"\n\nThe trial will likely take place in either July or September.\n\nThe consolidated case is In Re: Electronic Books Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-md-02293."}

(US Presswire)\n\nWhen the Vikings move into their new stadium in 2016, at least one former Minnesota resident will miss the confines of the Metrodome. That's because he made a ton of money from a pretty sweet arrangement that has lasted the past 30 years and the past two decades since he left the team.\n\nMake sure to check out this story from the St. Paul Pioneer Press, as author Brian Murphy tells the tale of how former general manager Mike Lynn continues to profit from the team, to the tune of millions of dollars, years after he left the organization.\n\nAs Murphy points out, Lynn is probably best remembered as the Vikings executive who dealt a rash of draft picks (seven) and five players to the Cowboys for the opportunity to employ running back Herschel Walker. Dallas went on to win three Super Bowls. Minnesota watched Walker gain less than 2,300 rushing yards in 42 games in parts of three seasons (he did score 20 touchdowns, though).\n\nAnd while that deal didn't work out so well for Minnesota, Lynn made out fabulously when, early in his 15-year reign as the team's general manager, he negotiated a contract that gave him 10 percent of the luxury suites revenue for every event that occurs inside the Dome. That's not just football games, mind you. Any event that occurs pays him more money. Including University of Minnesota games, Twins games, high school contests, tractor pulls, concerts, etc.\n\nThe paper reports that Lynn has profited between $14 million and $20 million for the deal that began in 1982 -- and has continued the 22 years since he left the team. Until the Vikings take leave of the Metrodome after the 2014 season, Lynn will continue to earn between $750,000 and $1 million per year.\n\nSo, just how bad has this deal been for the Vikings (and conversely so damn good for Lynn)?\n\n\"It's one of the worst sports deals anybody ever did,\" Marc Ganis, president of Chicago-based SportsCorp consulting firm, told the paper. \"You can't have somebody taking 10 percent of significant revenue clubs do not have to share with the league. It's untenable and one of the contributing factors for why the Vikings have needed subsidies from teams all these years.\"\n\nLynn apparently was offered a buyout from the deal at least once. Not surprisingly, he turned down that offer.\n\nMake sure to read the rest of the story. It's an interesting and well-researched look at how sometimes the NFL owners are the ones who get screwed.\n\n\nFor more NFL news, rumors and analysis, follow @EyeOnNFL on Twitter, and subscribe to our Pick-6 Podcast and NFL newsletter.

Google's Sundar Pichai, Senior Vice President of Android, Chrome, and Apps, even made a guest appearance on stage to give Intel's Doug Fisher a 'Noogler hat' to commemorate their new found partnership. At IDF 2013, Intel announced various enhancements for Android and how they are \"going to be adding things like 64-bit capabilities to the platform\".\n\nWait, you mean 64-bit capabilities like the newly announced iPhone 5S? Kind of, but the reality is a bit more complicated.\n\nIntel announced their Bay Trail platform. Of the processors announced, the Z3000 series will be Intel's Atom brand processor which competes against other ARM based mobile processors. Depending on the model, they sport either dual or quad cores SoCs. The most powerful SoC announced, the quad core Z3770, will put out clock speeds up to 2.4GHz and support higher screen resolutions of 2,560 x 1,600. Sometime in the first quarter of 2014, Intel plans to release a 64-bit version of Bay Trail SoC.\n\nWhat's this mean for Android?\n\nThe Bay Trail Z3000 series, is specifically designed for tablets running Android and Windows 8.1. Intel wants their new platform to succeed and is doing everything in their power to make this success a reality on Android.\n\nIntel started off by bragging that they have \"been one of the leading contributors to Linux in the market place\". That's definitely true for Android. They've been adding key AOSP commits, Android kernel code, optimizing Android's Dalvik VM, and tweaking drivers where needed to make sure Android runs the best it can on their new chips. Additionally, Intel's new NDK will allow Android developers to write C or C++ code for Android apps, which will help boost performance.\n\nNext up, Intel announced that they were \"going to be adding things like 64-bit capabilities to the platform\". As previously mentioned, coming in early 2014, Bay Trail will come in the 64-bit flavor. As shown above in multiple locations, Intel has been adding code to the Android Open Source Project in preparation for their upcoming 64-bit chip. In fact, they've been doing it for months.\n\nIf you're feelin' adventurous, you can hit up the source links below to see exactly what changes Intel is making. Just a warning: if you're not a developer, a lot of it won't make a whole lot of sense.\n\nDoes this mean the Android OS will be 64-bit capable?\n\nMost likely no. Not yet. Intel is just adding support for their upcoming Bay Trail 64-bit SoC. Android can run as a 32-bit operating system on top of a 64-bit capable processor. This has been done for years in the desktop world. When the day comes that Android is in fact 64-bit capable, Intel will most certain be ready.\n\nAssuming Android eventually does become a 64-bit solution, the next hurdle matches the iPhone 5S' current 64-bit limitations: apps and games need to leverage these capabilities or it's all for naught.\n\nAdditionally, Intel isn't the only Android OEM looking towards the future, Samsung recently announced that they too would be adding 64-bit capabilities in upcoming phones.\n\nSource: [IDF 2013] [Android Code Review 1, 2]"}

This amount was reduced from a total of 4,500 rupees to 2,000 rupees on 17 November. Anything above this needs to be credited to a bank account.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Old 500 and 1,000 rupee notes are no longer in circulation\n\nWhy?\n\nThe decision was taken to crack down on corruption and illegal cash holdings known as \"black money\". In an attempt to curb tax evasion, the government expects to bring billions of dollars of unaccounted cash into the economy because the banned bills make up more than 80% of the currency in circulation.\n\nSome 90% of transactions in India are in cash.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Long queues have been seen outside banks\n\nWhat's been the result?\n\nDisbelief.. and then the realisation that the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in every man and woman's pocket were suddenly redundant. People started flocking to banks and ATMs to withdraw cash or exchange the old notes.\n\nThe queues are long and people are short of cash - even buying daily essentials like milk and bread has become difficult. Police have had to be called in at some banks and ATMs to calm tempers.\n\nThe rules on what and how to change money are also changing as the government reacts to the crisis. On 15 November it was announced that indelible ink will be used to mark people's fingers to stop anyone trying to flout the rules.\n\nSo how are Indians coping?\n\nIt's a huge problem. More than half of Indians still don't have a bank account, and some 300 million have no government identification.\n\nPeople have been relying on card payments to shop, but those living in rural areas do not have this option because most stores don't have access to card-payment systems.\n\nExperts say that small businesses which mainly deal in cash are struggling. But there are examples of ingenuity amid the frustration - of shopkeepers acting as a local bank, the return of barter in some places.\n\nWill it work?\n\nSome experts believe the move will not curb corruption because people will start hoarding cash when the new currency becomes available. Others say it will boost the economy because banks will be flush with money.\n\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley recently announced that Indian banks had received three trillion rupees ($44.4bn) in cash in the first four days after the ban."}

{"id": 643, "ended": true, "length": 915, "text": "A few weeks ago I mentioned on twitter that I had a new favorite SSD. This is that SSD, and surprisingly enough, it's made by SanDisk.\n\nThe SanDisk part is very unexpected, because until now SanDisk hadn't really put out a very impressive drive. Much like Samsung in the early days of SSDs, SanDisk is best known for its OEM efforts. The U100 and U110 are quite common in Ultrabooks, and more recently even Apple adopted SanDisk as a source for its notebooks. Low power consumption, competitive pricing and solid validation kept SanDisk in the good graces of the OEMs. Unfortunately, SanDisk did little to push the envelope on performance, and definitely did nothing to prioritize IO consistency. Until now.\n\nThe previous generation SanDisk Extreme SSD used a SandForce controller, with largely unchanged firmware. This new drive however moves to a much more favorable combination for companies who have their own firmware development team. Like Crucial's M500, the Extreme II uses Marvell's 88SS9187 (codename Monet) controller. SanDisk also rolls its own firmware, a combination we've seen in previous SanDisk SSDs (e.g. the SanDisk Ultra Plus). Rounding out the nearly vertical integration is the use of SanDisk's 19nm eX2 ABL MLC NAND.\n\nThis is standard 2-bit-per-cell MLC NAND with a twist: a portion of each MLC NAND die is set to operate in SLC/pseudo-SLC mode. SanDisk calls this its nCache. The nCache is used as a lower latency/higher performance write buffer. In the Ultra Plus, I pointed out that there simply wasn't much NAND allocated to the nCache since it is pulled from the ~7% spare area on the drive. With the Extreme II SanDisk doubled the amount of spare area on the drive, which could impact the size of the nCache.\n\nSanDisk Extreme II Specifications 120GB 240GB 480GB Controller Marvell 88SS9187 NAND SanDisk 19nm eX2 ABL MLC NAND DRAM 128MB DDR3-1600 256MB DDR3-1600 512MB DDR3-1600 Form Factor 2.5\" 7mm Sequential Read 550MB/s 550MB/s 545MB/s Sequential Write 340MB/s 510MB/s 500MB/s 4KB Random Read 91K IOPS 95K IOPS 95K IOPS 4KB Random Write 74K IOPS 78K IOPS 75K IOPS Drive Lifetime 80TB Written Warranty 5 years MSRP $129.99 $229.99 $439.99\n\nSome small file writes are supposed to be buffered to the nCache, but that didn't seem to improve performance in the case of the Ultra Plus, leading me to doubt its effectiveness. However, SanDisk mentioned the nCache can be used to improve data integrity as well. The indirection/page table is stored in nCache, which SanDisk believes gives it a better chance of maintaining the integrity of that table in the event of sudden power loss (since writes to nCache are quicker than to the MLC portion of the NAND). The Extreme II itself doesn't have any capacitor based power loss data protection.\n\nDon't be too put off by the 80TB of drive writes rating for the drives. The larger drives should carry higher ratings (and they will last longer), but in order to claim a higher endurance SanDisk would have to actually validate to that higher endurance specification. For client drives, we often times see SSD vendors provide a single endurance rating in order to keep validation costs low - despite the fact that larger drives will be able to sustain more writes over the lifetime of the drive. SanDisk offers a 5 year warranty with the Extreme II.\n\nDespite the controller's capabilities (as we've seen with the M500), SanDisk's Extreme II doesn't enable any sort of AES encryption or eDrive support.\n\nWith the Extreme II, SanDisk moved to a much larger amount of DRAM per capacity point. Similar to Intel's S3700, SanDisk now uses around 1MB of DRAM per 1GB of NAND capacity. With a flat indirection/page table structure, sufficient DRAM and an increase in spare area, it would appear that SanDisk is trying to improve IO consistency. Let's find out if they have."}

{"id": 646, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "NEW YORK \u2014 There will come a point in time, and history tells us it will be sooner rather than later, when DeMarcus Cousins goes off the rails with his sixth and newest coach, Dave Joerger. That's when the Kings will need to figure out whether it's finally time to part ways with Cousins.\n\nHere's a little free advice for Kings vice president Vlade Divac: When that time comes, call Boston.\n\nMORE: Where does Cousins rank among best centers in the NBA?\n\nCeltics president Danny Ainge might not be quite ready to pull the trigger on a Cousins deal, risky as it sounds. It appears as if he's still looking to make a deal with the Sixers for Jahlil Okafor, who has been slow to take the court in preseason after having offseason knee surgery, or giving this current roster a shot with Al Horford, Kelly Olynyk and Amir Johnson rotating between the big men spots.\n\nBut Ainge has the necessary assets to make an even bolder move, for Cousins, one that would undoubtedly get LeBron James' attention in the Eastern Conference. And, he's got something else going for him when weighing whether he should roll the dice on Cousins. He has the perfect player to keep him in line: Isaiah Thomas, the Celtics' All-Star point guard and former Cousins teammate.\n\n\"If he came to Boston, that would be good, really good,\" Thomas told Sporting News last week, walking near the Barclays Center court in Brooklyn after the Celtics' preseason win over the Nets. \"The thing is, I've got his respect. I've always had that.\"\n\nThat's no small consideration, if you know anything about Cousins' erratic behavior. The 5-9 guard spent three seasons with Cousins in Sacramento, building a relationship no one else in the NBA has. From all accounts, he's the one and only King whom Cousins truly listened to when he had one of his legendary blow-ups and went astray.\n\nMORE: Eight players with the most to prove in 2016-17\n\nToday, there are Kings officials who still remember that Thomas was never afraid to stand up to Cousins during his worst moments. Since Thomas was traded to the Suns, then the Celtics, Cousins has bullied Kings coaches and players, unhappy with the franchise's continued losing through his six seasons without a playoff berth.\n\nThe Kings don't have an established, star-caliber player whom Cousins will respect. That's why they fear he's going to be trouble, once again.\n\n\"He needs to be a better teammate,\" Divac told Sirius XM NBA radio. \"It's up to him now to go to the next level as a player and it starts there.\"\n\nDEVENEY: Joerger faces challenge in breaking Cousins' bad habits\n\nCousins has been saying all the right things as he begins his seventh season. He believes that is going to change. He's been singing Joerger's praises, calling him, \"the perfect piece of the puzzle.\" He believes playing on Team USA and winning the gold medal in Rio has changed him for the better. \"I was a sponge with the guys. \u2026 I came out a better player,\" he said.\n\nBut a more grounded and emotionally stable player? We know his history: the outbursts at coaches, the suspensions and his failure to get along with teammates. So it's no stretch to think it's probably not going to happen in Sacramento, even if Joerger was able to work with some difficult characters in Memphis, including Matt Barnes and Lance Stephenson.\n\nJoerger, of course, wants Cousins to grow up because it will make his job so much easier. Imagine having arguably the most skilled center in the game, who can get you 27 points and 12 rebounds a night, and who also acts like a professional?\n\nBut Joerger came in with his eyes open and knows that Cousins was a nightmare for some of his predecessors, most notably Paul Westphal and George Karl. It got to a point where Kings owner Vivek Ranadive seemed like the only one who wanted to keep the big man. Now, he might not even have Ranadive on his side if he causes more trouble.\n\nThe problem will be finding a landing spot. There are more than a few NBA executives who won't trade for Cousins because he's too difficult to handle. So the Boston scenario makes perfect sense, even if Brad Stevens is a non-confrontational coach. He managed to weather the storm that was Rajon Rondo for 1 1/2 seasons. Ainge has the assets to get Cousins, including the Nets' No. 1 pick this coming June. But it all starts with having the right kind of leader.\n\nMORE: Why you should be rooting for Cousins to succeed\n\nSeveral minutes after the game in Brooklyn, Thomas stood in front of a chalkboard in the visitors' locker room and talked about"}

To contact Michelle with a question or comment, click here.\n\nThe days are long past when the only career doors that readily opened to young women were those marked teacher, secretary or nurse. Yet young adults who are part of the millennial generation are nearly twice as likely as baby boomers were to choose the nursing profession, according to a recent study.\n\nThese young people, born between 1982 and 2000, are also 60 percent more likely to become registered nurses than the Gen X'ers who were born between 1965 and 1981.\n\nWhat gives?\n\n\"There's no perfect answer,\" said David Auerbach, an external adjunct faculty member at Montana State University's College of Nursing and the lead author of the study, which was published this month in Health Affairs. The trend could be associated with economic factors, he said. Millennials came of age during a period of deep economic uncertainty with the Great Recession, which began in 2007, and the nursing profession generally offers stable earnings and low unemployment.\n\nInsuring Your Health KHN contributing columnist Michelle Andrews writes the series Insuring Your Health, which explores health care coverage and costs. To contact Michelle with a question or comment, click here. This KHN story can be republished for free (details).\n\nIn addition, researchers have teased out generational characteristics that might make nursing more attractive to millennials.\n\n\"These people are looking for more meaningful work and work that they care about,\" Auerbach said.\n\nOne thing that hasn't changed since the 1950s: Nursing is still dominated by women. In 2017, women made up at least 83 percent of registered nurses and licensed practical nurses, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nFor the study, researchers analyzed Census Bureau data on 429,585 registered nurses from 1979 to 2015. The study excluded data on advanced practice nurses.\n\nThe study found that the number of new entrants into the field has plateaued in recent years. Still, the millennial generation's embrace of the nursing profession should nearly compensate for the retirement of baby boomer nurses over the next dozen years and may help avert shortages, according to the researchers.\n\nMany factors will influence whether the supply of nurses is adequate in coming years. The health care needs of an aging population is only one of them.\n\n\"The growth in accountable care organizations and alternative payment models is probably the biggest factor,\" Auerbach said. For example, as hospitals move away from fee-for-service medicine toward models that pay based on quality and cost effectiveness, nurses' roles may shift, and fewer of them may be needed in hospital settings as inpatient care declines.\n\nPlease visit khn.org/columnists to send comments or ideas for future topics for the Insuring Your Health column."}

Presidential determinations may involve any number of actions, including setting or changing foreign policy.\n\n\"I have determined that the performance of the agreement will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defence and security,\" Obama wrote. \"I hereby approve the proposed agreement and authorize the Secretary of State to arrange for its execution.\"\n\nIn a statement to the US Congress yesterday and published by the White House the same day, Obama said the proposed agreement had been negotiated in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and other applicable laws.\n\n\"In my judgment, it meets all applicable statutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the United States,\" he said.\n\nThe proposed agreement provides a comprehensive framework for peaceful nuclear cooperation with China based on a mutual commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. It would permit the transfer of material, equipment (including reactors), components, information, and technology for nuclear research and nuclear power production. It does not permit transfers of any restricted data. Transfers of sensitive nuclear technology, sensitive nuclear facilities, and major critical components of such facilities may only occur if the agreement is amended to cover such transfers. In the event of termination, key nonproliferation conditions and controls continue with respect to material, equipment, and components subject to the agreement.\n\nIt would obligate the USA and China to work together \"to enhance their efforts to familiarize commercial entities in their respective countries about the requirements of the agreement as well as national export controls and policies applicable to exports and imports subject to the agreement\", Obama said.\n\nIt would have a term of 30 years from the date of its entry into force. Either party may terminate the proposed agreement on at least one year's written notice to the other party.\n\nObama noted that, since the 1980s, China has become a party to several nonproliferation treaties and conventions and worked to bring its domestic export control authorities in line with international standards. China joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1992 as a nuclear weapon state, brought into force an Additional Protocol to its International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards agreement in 2002, and joined the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 2004. China is a party to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, which establishes international standards of physical protection for use, storage, and transport of nuclear material, and has ratified the 2005 Amendment to the Convention.\n\n\"A more detailed discussion of China's civil nuclear program and its nuclear nonproliferation policies and practices, including its nuclear export policies and practices, is provided in the NPA [Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement] and in two classified annexes to the NPAS submitted to [Congress] separately,\" Obama said. The Director of National Intelligence will provide an addendum to the NPAS containing a comprehensive analysis of the export control system of China with respect to nuclear-related matters, he added.\n\nThe US Administration is prepared to begin immediately consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Obama said.\n\nResearched and written\n\nby World Nuclear News\n\nRelated topics"}

The Great Depression actually started in 1929, but as you will see below, as late as 1933 the Associated Press was still pumping out lots of news stories with optimistic economic headlines and many Americans still did not believe that we were actually in a depression. And of course we are experiencing a very similar thing today. The United States is in the worst financial shape that it has ever been in, our economic infrastructure is being systematically gutted, and poverty is absolutely exploding. Since the stock market crash of 2008, the Federal Reserve has been wildly printing money and the federal government has been running trillion dollar deficits in a desperate attempt to stabilize things, but in the process they have made our long-term economic problems far worse. It would be hard to overstate how dire our situation is, and yet the mainstream media continues to assure us that everything is just fine and that happy days are here again.\n\nAs I have already noted, the mainstream media was doing the exact same thing back during the days of the Great Depression. The following are actual Associated Press headlines from 1933\u2026\n\n\"Decisive Break from Panic Shown in Business Figures\"\n\n\"Markets Spurt To New Highs\"\n\n\"New Farm Bill to End Depression\"\n\nAnd the following is a headline discovery from 1933 that was made by Linda Goin\u2026\n\nI was browsing through old newspapers the other day and discovered a page filled with news about the stock market and banks in the Daily Capital News from Jefferson City, Missouri. The date was March 15, 1933, well into the Great Depression, and the news was cautiously celebratory as a headline read, \"Era of Fear is Declared at End Now.\"\n\nThe Depression-era classic song entitled \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" was played at the Democratic National Convention in 1932 and it went on to be featured by the Democrats for many years after that. The following is an excerpt from a Wikipedia article about that song\u2026\n\nToday, the song is probably best remembered as the campaign song for Franklin Delano Roosevelt's successful 1932 presidential campaign. According to TIME magazine, it gained prominence after a spontaneous decision by Roosevelt's advisers to play it at the 1932 Democratic National Convention, and went on to become the Democratic Party's \"unofficial theme song for years to come\".\n\nThere is only one huge problem.\n\nThe election of Roosevelt didn't end the depression. Years of bitter economic suffering and dust bowl conditions were still ahead. The Great Depression continued all the way up to the start of World War II, and the war years were certainly no picnic for average folks either.\n\nBut at least cheery headlines can make people feel better, right?\n\nThat is what some believe.\n\nOthers believe that giving people false hope is very cruel and that it sets up people for failure.\n\nThe following are some actual headlines that were found on mainstream news sites today\u2026\n\nCNBC: \"Recession risk gone in all US states but 1: Moody's Analytics\"\n\nCNN: \"Foreclosure crisis is drawing to a close\"\n\nNBC News: \"Stocks close near highs; S&P logs 7-day rally\"\n\nWow, those headlines sound great!\n\nSo are happy days here again?\n\nNot quite.\n\nIn fact, things continue to get even worse in a whole host of ways. Just consider the following statistics\u2026\n\n-According to a brand new Gallup poll that was just released, 20.0% of all Americans did not have enough money to buy food that they or their families needed at some point over the past year. That is just under the record of 20.4% that was set back in November 2008.\n\n-Gallup also found that the ability of American families to meet some of their other most basic needs is near an all-time low\u2026\n\nThe Basic Access Index, which includes 13 questions about topics including Americans' ability to afford food, housing, and healthcare, was 81.4 in August, on par with the all-time low of 81.2 recorded in October 2011.\n\n\u2013More than 90 million working age Americans are considered to be \"not in the labor force\".\n\n-The labor force participation rate is the lowest that it has been in 35 years.\n\n\u2013516,000 Americans \"left the labor force\" last month. That was a brand new all-time record high.\n\n-The number of private sector jobs dropped by 278,000 last month.\n\n\u201377 percent of the jobs that have been \"created\" so far this year have been part-time jobs.\n\n-Approximately one out of every four part-time workers in America is living below the poverty line.\n\n-Right now, 40 percent of all U.S. workers are making less than what a full-time minimum wage worker made back in 1968.\n\n-The U.S. trade deficit with China"}

Here are our votes for the top performances of the day.\n\nOFFENSE\n\nIn what I am sure will be a surprise to no one, Rodgers earns our first game ball on offense. Dealing with a patchwork receiving corps even before the loss of Jermichael Finley, he led the team on back-to-back touchdown drives to start the game. Then, after Finley went down, he got the Packers in the end zone twice more, finishing with 260 yards and three touchdowns. He didn't quite look like himself over the past few weeks, but his accuracy was back on yesterday, despite the less-than-ideal weather conditions, and his leadership was clearly on display with so many young receivers playing.\n\nBoykin put up the surprise stat line of the day, as Rodgers and company looked to get him involved in the offense early and often and take some pressure off Jordy Nelson. It certainly worked, especially late in the game, as Boykin responded to his 10 targets by catching eight of them for 103 yards and a hard-work touchdown. Boykin made two big plays in the fourth quarter, one being a catch-and-run for 39 yards, and his score being the other. All in all, Packers fans should feel a little better about the team missing James Jones thanks to Boykin's big day.\n\nJermichael Finley\n\nBefore his brutal injury that has left his status still in doubt, Finley was having another big game, with five catches for 72 yards and a score. On that touchdown, which capped off the first drive of the game for the Packers, Finley caught the ball in the left flat, evaded two would-be tacklers, and shrugged off a third on his way to the end zone. He caught all five balls thrown his way on the day and would have had another 20-yard completion if not for a holding penalty. Our thoughts are with him as his recovery from his neck injury is ongoing.\n\nDEFENSE\n\nThe star of the Packers' secondary on Sunday was House, who recorded an interception and three pass breakups on the day. His pick game in the first quarter on a terrible throw by Brandon Weeden, where all House really had to do was not drop a ball thrown right to the yellow circle in the middle his jersey. His later pass defense was more impressive, including a perfect play to recover and knock the ball away from Josh Gordon on a long fourth-down pass attempt.\n\nThe Packers aren't really missing Brad Jones in the middle, thanks to Lattimore's play over the past few weeks. He was a blur on Sunday, regularly shooting gaps in the line and playing solidly in pass coverage. He finished the day with 12 total tackles (9 solo), a pass breakup, and one sack of Weeden. With youngsters flanking him and A.J. Hawk, Lattimore was decisive in his breaks to the ball, and showed impressive athleticism on Sunday.\n\nHONORABLE MENTION\n\nEddie Lacy, Jordy Nelson, Sam Shields, Micah Hyde\n\nMore from Acme Packing Company:"}

There is a lot to remember in biochemistry, and a lot of words which don't mean much that have to go in the right place. JAK activates JEK activates MEK which activates an enzyme which travels to the nucleus and binds to blah which attaches to blah region of the DNA and has the effect of increasing glucose absorption. Or something. Frankly I can't remember anymore, and I'm damn glad I don't have to try.\n\nMeaningless acronyms are an annoying part of science, and of any job really. At work I talk about getting a tvc cadded, matching the key to the clapper and ingesting it \u2013 to anyone who hasn't done TV advertising this is complete jibberish. Biochemistry is really no different \u2013 if you don't know much about it, it's because no one has explained it to you properly using normal words.\n\nThis post is not about normal words. Screw normal words! This is about the awesome, the spectacular, the creative and the downright weird.\n\nThese are some of the coolest names I have come across for proteins and genes, and a lot of them are found in the fruit fly Drosophila. Drosophila is the white lab rat of developmental science, it's always the guinea pig because it reproduces REALLY fast, and creates multiple offspring in a single frenzy. Some other species (including humans) also get a mention in this list.\n\nTinman \u2013 Drosophila with a mutation to tinman develop with no heart.\n\nMaggie \u2013 a mutation causes arrested development, in the Simpsons Maggie never ages.\n\nCheap Date \u2013 mutation causes Drosophila to be extra sensitive to alcohol. Another gene called Lush does the same thing.\n\nCleopatra \u2013 Cleopatra was killed by an asp, and interaction of mutant Cleopatra protein with the Asp protein is lethal.\n\nKen and Barbie \u2013 mutants (both male and female) lack external genitals.\n\nSwiss Cheese \u2013 mutants have holes in their brain.\n\nGrim Reaper \u2013 two separate genes, together they cause cell death.\n\nFor those biblically minded of us, there is Lot \u2013 mutants have more salt than usual, or Sarah \u2013 mutants are almost sterile, or Methuselah \u2013 mutants live extra long. Prefer Greek Myths? How about Ariadne, who showed Theseus how to get through the Minotaurs Labyrinth \u2013 in Drosophila, Ariadne mutants stop the axons of nerve cells finding their targets. Love Shakespeare (who doesn't?), take Hamlet \u2013 which affects development of cells descended from IIB cells \u2013 \"to be or not to be.\"\n\nSometimes the names help us remember how things link together, take these names from Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant that's like the Drosophila of plant genetics. Superman mutants have extra stamens in their flowers, while the Clark Kent is a milder version of the mutation, and Kryptonite suppresses the function of Superman.\n\nZebrafish have some neat ones too \u2013 including one-eyed pinhead, cyclops and squint \u2013 all important in the development of an embryo.\n\nHow about in humans? Well yesterday I talked about a spiky little protein called Sonic Hedgehog, which was originally found in, you guessed it, Drosophila, but which plays an important role in embryo development in humans. There's not a huge number of genes with cool names in humans, and there's a good reason for that. Imagine you had a child who was very sick and you met with the doctor, who looked at you seriously and said \"I'm sorry, it's genetic. Your son has a mutation in the Sonic Hedgehog gene.\" There are a couple of others, like Tigger which is a segment of DNA which hops around into different locations\n\nThose are my faves, but there's plenty more out there. These are samples from My Favourite Gene Names and Gene Names by Organism, and I know there's others that didn't make the list. FlyNome has a searchable database of heaps of Drosophila genes and the story behind them. It's almost worth getting into Drosophila research just for the cool names, plus imagine if you found a new gene and got to name it yourself\u2026 oh the possibilities\u2026"}

It now appears that Bitcoin suffered the same (but buying burst) manipulation in the last year as The Willy Report notes that last year, a number of traders began noticing suspicious behavior on Mt. Gox. Basically, a random number between 10 and 20 bitcoin would be bought every 5-10 minutes, non-stop, for at least a month on end until the end of January. Each time, (1) an account was created, (2) the account spent some very exact amount of USD to market-buy coins ($2.5m was most common), (3) a new account was created very shortly after. Repeat. In total, a staggering ~$112 million was spent to buy close to 270,000 BTC \u2013 the bulk of which was bought in November. So if you were wondering how Bitcoin suddenly appreciated in value by a factor of 10 within the span of one month, well, this is why. Not Chinese investors, not the Silkroad bust \u2013 these events may have contributed, but they certainly were not the main reason. But who did it? and why?\n\n\nIt needs to be recognized that, whether intentional or not (though plausible ignorance only goes so far), Mt. Gox has effectively been abusing Bitcoin to operate a Ponzi scheme for at least a year. The November \"bubble\" well into the $1000?s \u2013 and possibly April's as well \u2013 was driven by hundreds of millions of dollars of fake liquidity pumped into the market out of thin air (note that this is equivalent to \"with depositors' money\"). It is only natural that the Bitcoin price would deflate for around 5 months since its December peak, since there was never enough fiat coming in to support these kind of prices in the first place.\n\n\nVia The Willy Report,\n\nSomewhere in December 2013, a number of traders including myself began noticing suspicious bot behavior on Mt.

Speaking in his parliamentary office, where a framed photo of Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson hangs on the wall next to a picture of Margaret Thatcher, Halfon explained the potentially dire situation his party is in.\n\nHe said: \"The party is in danger of dying in my view - the infrastructure is collapsing around the country, the membership is ever aging.\n\n\"Of course we have an incredible party and the members are unbelievable, and I would not be here if it wasn't for volunteers, but everywhere you go, particularly in marginal seats, it's a disaster in many cases.\n\nHalfon, who campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU, went on: \"Labour are getting thousands of new members, Ukip are getting thousands of new members and if anything, if I can praise Vote Leave, what did they do in one year with very little money \u2013 they created a grassroots organisation, in every constituency in the country with badges, stickers and signs, brilliantly organised from nothing.\n\n\"That is the way politics is nowadays. The Conservative Party has to create a grassroots movement like Vote Leave and campaign on issues one by one which are appealing to people.\n\n\"You have to rally people around an issue but do it in modern ways - whether it's through social media and also doing the ground war.\n\n\"You can have the existing stuff going on but you need to create a new kind of grassroots movement.\"\n\nHalfon has represented the Essex seat of Harlow since 2010, winning it from Labour in that year's General Election.\n\nHe admits that since working in the town, which has below average earnings compared to both the region and the country, his political views have changed from being a \"free market Thatcherite\" to someone who recognises the need for a \"social ambulance\" alongside a meritocratic ladder.\n\nHalfon said: \"We are in danger of being deserted by the millions of working people who have deserted Labour because they don't feel we are on their side. They feel they are the party of BHS and not the NHS \u2013 by BHS I mean the corporate, awful revolting people like that Phillip Green and the dodgy guy he sold it to.\"\n\nHalfon claimed workers in his constituency's branch of BHS were \"thrown on the scrap heap because of the greed, the mismanagement of corporate capitalism.\"\n\nHe went on: \"The modern Conservative party needs to launch an assault on the so-called crony capitalism and protect workers and stand up for them.\"\n\nBranching into policy ideas, Halfon called for the Conservatives to become the \"party of redistribution\", arguing that extra money generated for the Treasury by tax cuts for the wealthy should be used to cut taxes for the poor or help impoverished communities.\n\n\"That's a Conservative idea of redistribution, rather than a socialist one which says you increase taxes on people and redistribute the wealth,\" Halfon said.\n\nHe also called for a massive increase in house building, and argued that while schemes such as Help to Buy are a step in the right direction, it was not enough to solve the crisis.\n\n\"If I think of my own constituents and I think of millions working people across the country they can barely afford a few thousand quid.\n\n\"The idea of getting \u00a35,000 is impossible. Even if the Government says 'We'll match it' they can't do it.\n\n\"We need to build millions of social housing. I prefer it to be done by housing associations but I'm not against council housing.\n\n\"But social housing should be as much of a priority of as building millions of affordable houses or by-to-let schemes.\"\n\nThere is one area where Halfon does not want to see fundamental reform, and that is the NHS.\n\nThe Tory MP is very open about how the voters view his party when it comes to the health service.\n\n\"The public don't trust us on the NHS.

Both are LNG ECs, or emergency contraceptives that include levonorgestrel, a synthetic version of the hormone progestogen. Emergency contraceptives are often called the morning-after pill because they work by interfering with ovulation, preventing the fertilization of an egg.\n\nTeva Pharmaceuticals, which manufactures Plan B, did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration \"is currently reviewing the available and related scientific information on this issue, including the publication upon which the Norlevo labeling change was based,\" said spokeswoman Erica Jefferson. \"The agency will then determine what, if any, labeling changes to emergency contraceptives are warranted.\"\n\nPlan B is available in the United States without a prescription to anyone of any age . Its generic versions Next Choice One Dose and My Way are also the same as Norlevo, Cleland said.\n\nUnder U.S. federal law, generic brands cannot change their labeling until the name brand product does. \"Actavis' Next Choice One Dose is approved by the FDA as a safe, effective and therapeutically equivalent treatment option to its brand counterpart,\" said Actavis spokesman David Belian. \"Therefore, should any update to the Plan B labeling take place, we would make the appropriate change to our product as well.\"\n\nEuropean health authorities approved the Norlevo label change a few weeks ago, but it will take several months to implement in all the countries HRA Pharma supplies, Gainer said. The new packaging slip will say the emergency contraceptive is \"not recommended ... if you weigh (165 pounds) or more,\" according to Mother Jones , which first reported the story.\n\nIt is unclear why emergency contraceptives may be less effective for overweight women, said Anna Glasier, an expert in reproductive medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Glasier published a study in 2011 that analyzed the risk of pregnancy for women who had taken emergency contraception.\n\nGlasier and her colleagues found that obese women had three times the risk of getting pregnant after taking emergency contraception than those with a normal body weight. The risk was greater for those who had taken levonorgestrel pills, compared with those who had taken ulipristal acetate, which is used in another emergency contraceptive called Ella\n\n\"There has been some evidence over the years that low doses of progestogen-only contraceptives have less efficacy in heavier women, but we do not know why,\" Glasier told CNN. That said, \"it is well recognized that body weight affects the way drugs are metabolized.\"\n\nPrevious research has shown that women who weigh more than 155 pounds are at a higher risk of regular oral contraception failure. These drugs take longer to reach normal concentration levels in the blood of obese women compared with normal weight women, according to one study . That may be one reason emergency contraceptives are less effective.\n\nGlasier noted that the number of obese women in her study was small, so it's hard to make broad recommendations based on the research. In the general population, studies show levonorgestrel emergency contraception prevents about 50% of expected pregnancies.\n\n\"You are probably better to take LNG-EC after unprotected sex than just to leave it to chance even if you are obese,\" Glasier said.\n\n\"When faced with a choice ... I don't think the findings are strong enough for us to tell women that they should not use LNG-EC,\" Cleland agreed. \"Because Plan-B One Step is now available over-the-counter and is by far the easiest EC method to get, this is the method that most women are familiar with.\"\n\nCleland recommends overweight women who are worried about the pill's effectiveness use"}

{"id": 669, "ended": true, "length": 763, "text": "Hydrogen is not an energy source, but is an energy vector or carrier. This means that it has to be produced from one of the primary energy sources: fossil fuels, nuclear, solar, wind, biomass, hydro, geothermal and urban waste resources. All the energy we use, including hydrogen, must be produced from one of these three primary energy resources.\n\nOn earth, hydrogen is found combined with other elements. For example, in water, hydrogen is combined with oxygen. In fossil fuels, it is combined with carbon as in petroleum, natural gas or coal. The challenge is to separate hydrogen from other naturally occurring compounds in an efficient and economic manner. See the \"Hydrogen Production Paths\" chart below for unique ways to produce hydrogen from the three sources.\n\nThere are several methods for producing or extracting hydrogen. Steam reforming is a well-established technology that allows hydrogen production from hydrocarbons and water. Steam-methane reformation currently produces about 95 percent of the hydrogen used in the United States.\n\nAnother conventional technique is electrolysis, which applies electrical current to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules. The electricity for electrolysis can come from any of the three energy sources.\n\nThe cost of hydrogen production is an important issue. Hydrogen produced by steam reformation costs approximately three times the cost of natural gas per unit of energy produced. This means that if natural gas costs $6/million BTU, then hydrogen will be $18/million BTU. Also, producing hydrogen from electrolysis with electricity at 5 cents/kWh will cost $28/million BTU \u2014 slightly less than two times the cost of hydrogen from natural gas. Note that the cost of hydrogen production from electricity is a linear function of electricity costs, so electricity at 10 cents/kWh means that hydrogen will cost $56/million BTU.\n\nA listing of the cost and performance characteristics of various hydrogen production processes is as follows:\n\nEnergy Required (kWh/Nm3) Process Ideal Practical Status of Tech.

But IBM's aspirations for its artificially intelligent supercomputer are now less quiz show champion and more medical genius.\n\n\"Watson, the supercomputer that is now the world Jeopardy champion, basically went to med school after it won Jeopardy,\" MIT's Andrew McAfee, coauthor of The Second Machine Age, said recently in an interview with Smart Planet. \"I'm convinced that if it's not already the world's best diagnostician, it will be soon.\"\n\nWatson is already capable of storing far more medical information than doctors, and unlike humans, its decisions are all evidence-based and free of cognitive biases and overconfidence. It's also capable of understanding natural language, generating hypotheses, evaluating the strength of those hypotheses, and learning \u2014 not just storing data, but finding meaning in it.\n\nAs IBM scientists continue to train Watson to apply its vast stores of knowledge to actual medical decision-making, it's likely just a matter of time before its diagnostic performance surpasses that of even the sharpest doctors.\n\nBack in 2011, McAfee wrote on his blog about why a diagnosis from \"Dr. Watson\" would be a gamechanger:\n\nIt's based on all available medical knowledge. Human doctors can't possibly hold this much information in their heads, or keep up it as it changes over time. Dr. Watson knows it all and never overlooks or forgets anything. It's accurate. If Dr. Watson is as good at medical questions as the current Watson is at game show questions, it will be an excellent diagnostician indeed. It's consistent. Given the same inputs, Dr. Watson will always output the same diagnosis. Inconsistency is a surprisingly large and common flaw among human medical professionals, even experienced ones. And Dr. Watson is always available and never annoyed, sick, nervous, hungover, upset, in the middle of a divorce, sleep-deprived, and so on. It has very low marginal cost. It'll be very expensive to build and train Dr. Watson, but once it's up and running the cost of doing one more diagnosis with it is essentially zero, unless it orders tests. It can be offered anywhere in the world. If a person has access to a computer or mobile phone, Dr. Watson is on call for them.\n\nAn April study estimated that as many as 1 in 20 U.S. adults are misdiagnosed by their human doctors each year, so it's an area ripe for improvement and competition.\n\nThat's one reason IBM has been pumping Watson full of medical knowledge \u2014 a subject area that's actually significantly more contained than \"all the world's general knowledge,\" which is what Watson tried to learn for Jeopardy.\n\nWatson has \"read\" dozens of textbooks, all of PubMed and Medline (two massive databases of medical journals), and thousands of patient records from Memorial Sloan Kettering. All together, \"Watson has analyzed 605,000 pieces of medical evidence, 2 million pages of text, 25,000 training cases and had the assist of 14,700 clinician hours fine-tuning its decision accuracy,\" Forbes reported in 2013.\n\nAnd it's getting \"smarter\" every year. So how would Dr. Watson work in practice? Here's how IBM describes the process:\n\nFirst, the physician might describe symptoms and other related factors to the system. Watson can then identify the key pieces of information and mine the patient's data to find relevant facts about family history, current medications and other existing conditions. It combines this information with current findings from tests, and then forms and tests hypotheses by examining a variety of data sources\u2014treatment guidelines, electronic medical record data and doctors' and nurses' notes, as well as peer-reviewed research and clinical studies. From here, Watson can provide potential treatment options and its confidence rating for each suggestion.\n\nThe supercomputer's potential is huge, but \u2014 as The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year \u2014 currently \"just a handful of customers are using Watson in their daily business,\" and it's far from performing at the level and in the range of domains that should be possible in the future.\n\nSo far, IBM's most high-profile AI partnerships are with MD Anderson Cancer Center, where Watson helps recommend leukemia treatments, and WellPoint, where Watson helps the insurer evaluate doctors' treatment plans.\n\nWellpoint, currently the exclusive reseller for Dr. Watson, has claimed that the system is already significantly better than human doctors at diagnosing lung cancer.\n\nWatson is not yet able to leverage all the information it has absorbed, so it still has a ways to go before it catches up with our best human diagnosticians, whose versatility and agility is difficult to match. But Watson's ability to learn, analyze, and apply knowledge suggests that it will get there \u2014 eventually.\n\n\"If and when Dr. Watson gets as good at"}

{"id": 673, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - While working for U.S. intelligence agencies, Edward Snowden had another secret identity: an online commentator who anonymously railed against citizen surveillance and corporate greed.\n\nProtesters supporting Edward Snowden, a contractor at the National Security Agency (NSA), hold a photo of Snowden during a demonstration outside the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong June 13, 2013. REUTERS/Bobby Yip\n\nThroughout the eight years that Snowden worked for the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency contractors, he posted hundreds of messages on a public Internet forum under a pseudonym.\n\n\"I can't hope to change the way things are going by overtly complaining, writing letters, or blowing things up,\" Snowden wrote in 2003 in response to a discussion about corporate greed on the Ars Technica online forum.\n\n\"That's not the way a good person does things. I will, however, do what I can with the tools that are available to me.\"\n\nNew information discovered by Reuters about Snowden's employment record, online postings and education comes as U.S. lawmakers grill intelligence officials about how a 29-year-old high school dropout managed to gain access to such top secrets as the NSA's electronic surveillance programs.\n\nAccording to sources briefed on the matter, Snowden was employed by an unidentified classified agency in Washington from 2005 to mid-2006, by the CIA from 2006 to 2009, when he primarily worked overseas, and by Dell Inc DELL.O from 2009 to 2013, when he worked in the United States and Japan as an NSA contractor.\n\nHe was also a prolific commentator on technology forum Ars Technica, posting approximately 750 messages using the screen name \"The True HOOHA\" from late 2001 to 2012.\n\nMost of the postings were not political in nature: he dispensed advice about government careers, polygraphs and the 2008 stock market crash. He claimed to own the same gun as James Bond and posted glamour photos of himself. He jokingly compared the video console Xbox Live to NSA surveillance.\n\nOne of his postings, however, dealt with the now familiar issue of corporate compliance with government eavesdropping programmes. On February 4, 2010, while working for Dell, Snowden commented on a discussion about a major technology company that allegedly was giving the U.S. government access to its computer servers.\n\n\"It really concerns me how little this sort of corporate behavior bothers those outside of technology circles,\" Snowden wrote. \"Society really seems to have developed an unquestioning obedience towards spooky types.\"\n\nIt is not clear if his former employers knew about his online persona. The CIA, NSA, Dell and Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH.N) - which most recently employed Snowden - declined to comment.\n\nOne former national security official said the government should have scrubbed his record harder. But Stewart Baker, former general counsel for the NSA, said holding such views did not automatically disqualify someone for a sensitive government job.\n\n\"Maybe the government will have to look at that again but that's a difficult thing to decide,\" Baker said.\n\nUNDER SCRUTINY\n\nAccording to the sources, Snowden told employers he took computer classes at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, earned a certificate from the University of Maryland's campus in Tokyo, and expected in 2013 to earn a master's degree in computer security from the University of Liverpool in England.\n\nA Johns Hopkins spokeswoman said she could not find a record of Snowden's attendance but he may have taken correspondence courses for which records are not kept. A Maryland official confirmed Snowden attended at least one summer class. A Liverpool spokeswoman said Snowden registered for an online master's degree in computer security in 2011, but did not complete it.\n\nBorn in 1983 in North Carolina, Snowden grew up in a Maryland suburb near the NSA headquarters. He left high school in 10th grade and later earned a G.E.D. At 18, he worked as a webmaster for Ryuhana Press, a start-up promoting Japanese anime artists.\n\nSnowden began posting on Ars Technica on December 29, 2001. He sought technical help for his work at the anime site and a website company called Clockwork Chihuahua.\n\nAs early as 2002, Snowden wrote online of his desire to work in Japan: \"It is pretty far-fetched, but I've always dreamed of being able to make it in Japan.\"\n\nAn avid gamer, he posted on the ethics of video game piracy in 2003: \"I feel the megacorporation is promoting hyper-materialism and I don't like that. That means I want to punish the company in any way I can.\"\n\n\"Legality does not factor into this, getting away with it (OMG dispensing justice LOL!) in order to do it again does,\" Snowden added. \"If my actions contribute to driving the corporation I view as \"evil\" into the ground, I'll sleep easier at night knowing I have (in my mind)"}

He hadn't played since 2014, but guys around the league were probably aware that Allen hadn't actually quit.\n\nNaturally, his former teammates were asked to comment on Allen's news. Having played for four teams over a lengthy NBA career, Allen had plenty of teammates. None, however, could answer the question like Rajon Rondo.\n\nRajon Rondo on Ray Allen's retirement announcement: \"I thought he'd been retired.\" \u2014 Sean Highkin (@highkin) November 1, 2016\n\nIn fairness, it could have been an honest mistake, but even if he didn't know that Allen wasn't retired, Rondo is a bright enough guy that he could have played it off by paying Allen a bunch of compliments the way everyone does when a player retires.\n\nRondo's quip shouldn't come as a massive surprise considering Paul Pierce admitted to Jackie MacMullan in 2015 that Rondo and Allen didn't really like each other. In fact, Pierce said that Allen didn't really have a strong relationship with anyone on those Celtics teams.\n\n\"It was a weird relationship,'' Pierce told MacMullan. \"We were all good friends on the court, but Ray always did his own thing. That's just the way Ray was. Even when we were playing together, we'd be having a team dinner and Ray wouldn't show up. We'd go to his charity events but Ray wouldn't show up to somebody else's.\n\n\"I called him on it. I said, 'Man, Ray, we support all your stuff but when we ask you, you don't come to ours.' I remember when Rondo re-signed with Boston, we had a little dinner at a restaurant and Ray didn't show up.\n\n\"I know Ray probably didn't like Rondo that much, but it wasn't a fact of not liking somebody. You don't have to like everybody you play with -- it's a matter of showing support.\n\n\"Rondo probably didn't like Ray either, but he came to Ray's functions to show, 'Hey, we're together in this.'\n\n\"It's not a bad thing with Ray. We had a great relationship on the court. But even the year we won it, after a game we'd say, 'Let's go have something to eat and have a night with the older guys.' We'd get there and it would be me, Kevin and Sam (Cassell), but no Ray. In a lot of ways, me, Sam and Kevin were our Big Three.\n\n\"It just got to the point where it was, 'That's Ray.' No hard feelings. Everyone made such a big deal of us not talking after we left, but there really wasn't much there.''\n\nAfter being acquired via trade during the 2007 NBA draft, Allen played five seasons for the Celtics, winning his first NBA title in the 2007-08. He departed for Miami following the 2011-12 season, winning his second and final championship the next year."}

That's how sporting success is measured nowadays.\n\nThe event was the Fifa Interactive World Cup, an annual e-sports competition, featuring the world's best gamers, competing in the multimillion-selling Fifa computer game series. For a growing number of fans, these teen and 20-something cyber athletes are a new kind of star in international football, securing their own lucrative sponsorship deals and attracting huge numbers of viewers to their official channels on YouTube and Twitch, a live streaming service.\n\nMore than a dozen major clubs around the world, including West Ham and Manchester City, have now employed Fifa players to represent them in e-sports competitions and this blurring of the lines between the real and virtual sports is something publisher Electronic Arts is very keen to foster.\n\nSince its inception in 1993, the Fifa series has sought to replicate every facet of the professional game, forging licensing deals with international sides and clubs all over the world to use their player names and stadiums.\n\nFifa 17, which comes out later this month, features more than 650 sides from 30 leagues, and hundreds of key players have been digitally scanned in HD detail to ensure accurate facial likenesses. It is a process that has led to the game's dominance of the sports sim genre, shifting more than 7 million copies a year. But it is not always smooth.\n\nThis week, Iceland's football association, KSI, complained about the small sum of $15,000 (\u00a311,500) it was offered to feature the country's national side in the latest Fifa title. \"They are the ones buying these rights and they almost want it for free,\" KSI president Geir \u00deorsteinsson told the BBC. \"The performance at the Euros show that we are quite a good team and many would like to play with our team.\"\n\nElectronic Arts will not comment on individual deals, but David Rutter, vice president and executive producer of the Fifa series, concedes that these negotiations are a vital \u2013 and challenging \u2013 element of the development process. \"We have a dedicated team who manage licences with clubs, leagues, and partners,\" he said. \"It is sometime straightforward. It is sometimes complex.\"\n\nThings seem to have gone much more smoothly with the English Premier League. In 2010, Electronic Arts inked a deal to become the organisation's technology partner, with EA Sports branding appearing on all televised matches and EA sponsorship of the league's player performance index, which gathers stats on all Premier matches. In August, EA Sports became the lead partner of the Premier League, giving it even greater access to clubs and players.\n\nBut in a troubled sector, where corruption scandals and rising ticket prices are alienating fans, the integration between the Fifa franchise and the real sport of football is mutually beneficial. EA gets the official credentials, but Fifa gets to connect with a young demographic that is moving away from viewing mainstream televised sports or attending matches and toward watching YouTubers and e-sports.\n\nAccording to market analyst Super Data, the global e-sports market will be worth $1bn in 2017, the revenue coming from advertising, ticket sales and merchandise, with a global online audience of more than 200 million.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Iceland's performance at Euro 2016 led to a disagreement over the fee paid to the country's football association for inclusion in this year's title/ Photograph: Bertrand Langlois/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"If you look into certain sports in the US \u2013 like baseball where the average viewer is 53 [years old] or to niche sports like Nascar and wrestling \u2013 e-sports can compete,\" said Manny Anekal, founder of e-sports media company Versus Sports. \"In fact, just this past week, the Turner Sports eLeague actually drew more viewers in both 'total' and '18-34 [years old] demographics than the televised [Chelsea v Liverpool Premier League match]. That was pretty impressive to me.\"\n\nThrough the Fifa titles, then, the sport has a chance to reconnect with a young viewer base and thereby maintain its lucrative advertising deals with youth brands such as Coke and Adidas. \"A lot of kids are getting priced out of going to matches, especially with the English Premier League,\"says David Bytheway, a pro Fifa player who now represents\n\nGerman Bundesliga side Wolfsburg in Fifa tournaments.\n\n\"One of Wolfsburg's main strategies in getting involved with Fifa is to connect with their fans in the interactive world. When children get home from school, switching on the TV isn't the first thing they're doing anymore \u2013 they're going onto YouTube watching celebrity gamers. Football clubs need to reach these fans.\"\n\nUntil this year, Fifa"}
{"id": 680, "ended": true, "length": 392, "text": "BACKGROUND:\n\nAdiponectin is a hormone secreted by adipocytes during the fasting phase of the fast-fed cycle. Ramadan fasting involves prolonged fasting for up to twelve hours and thus could lead to increased secretion of adiponectin by adipocytes. However, studies on the role of adiponectin on glucose and body weight homeostasis during Ramadan fasting is still a matter of controversy. Thus the specific aim of this study was to assess the effect of fasting during Ramadan on the adiponectin levels, body weight and glucose homeostasis in healthy male Malaysian subjects.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nTwenty healthy male (19-23 years) Muslim subjects were followed up during the fasting month of Ramadan. Anthropometry and blood samples were taken one week before and during the fourth week of fasting. Plasma glucose, insulin and adiponectin were estimated and insulin sensitivity indices were estimated using the Homeostasis Model Assessment.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nSubjects experienced a significant decrease in body weight (2.4 %, p < 0.001) and body mass index (5.5 %, p < 0.01). There was also a significant decrease of 12.3 %, 52.8 % and 45.6 % of plasma glucose, insulin and adiponectin respectively (p < 0.01). The drop in adiponectin was positively correlated with the decrease in body weight (r = 0.45, p < 0.05). There was also a significant increase in insulin sensitivity and a decrease in insulin resistance (p < 0.01).\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nThese results indicate that Ramadan fasting in young healthy individuals has a positive impact on the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. It also shows that adiponectin levels dropped along with significant loss in weight. We feel caloric restriction during the Ramadan fasting is in itself sufficient to improve insulin sensitivity in healthy individuals."}

Noticeable on the video is a cross and a rosary on the wall, which might indicate they are still in Italy which is a Catholic country.\n\nSwiss prison officer Angela Magdici, right, let her rapist lover Hassan Kiko, left, out of his prison cell and escaped with him in a BMW X1 bought for her by her former husband\n\nMagdici walked out on her husband Vasile Magdici after she cleaned out their bank accounts\n\nKiko, pictured, was jailed for four years for raping a 15-year-old girl in a friend's car\n\nThe vehicle was one that she had purchased together with her husband Vasile Magdici, who she had walked out on after emptying the joint bank account three months earlier.\n\nIn the separate videos posted by the pair, Kiko was smoking a cigarette at the time and started off by complaining about the food in jail which, he said, was terrible.\n\nHe said: 'This crap food, which I was always given by these crap people.' He then went on to complain had been abused in jail showing what he said were bruises on his legs and neck, and claimed that he had been forced to share a section of the jail with people who are HIV positive.\n\nHe had been jailed by a court in Dietikon last December for four years for raping a 15-year-old schoolgirl in a friend's car but on the video he insisted he was innocent.\n\nHe said that the was no evidence that the rape ever took place.\n\nHe then went on to swear about his defence lawyer, the judge and the prosecutors, and added that the appalling conditions in jail and his unfair conviction were justification for the fact that he had fled.\n\nHe went on: 'I prayed to God, and asked him for help, because I'm innocent. And God sent her to me.' He said that God had listened to his prayer, and that once God had agreed to help them escape, even the Swiss jail with all of its doors could not do anything against the power of God.\n\nMagdici, 32, right, let Kiko, left, out of his cell to allow his escape while her colleague was asleep\n\nMagdici, left, released a video for her family where she expressed her love for the Syrian rapist\n\nSwiss police are looking at the videos released by the couple to see if they contain clues of their locations\n\nIn a separate video Angela, who has now been on the run with her lover for a month, said: 'I want to apologise to my family. Everything was so surreptitious but it was not possible to say anything before vanishing from your lives. I am really sorry, and I love you all very much.'\n\nShe went on to explain: 'What we did was a result of love.' She said that was not an excuse, but simply an explanation. She added: 'Hassan is the love of my life. I have never met such an honourable, warm and sensitive and funny man as him.'\n\nThe couple said that the video was taken on March 16, although it is unclear where, but police experts are already studying it and attempting to locate where the noticeable table cloth with butterfly patterns might have been sold.\n\nSwiss police spokesperson Carmen Surber confirmed: 'The videos are now part of the investigation.

Instead, we see rights practices as the function of power struggles that include but go far beyond formal law. Instead, we emphasize an important distinction between de jure human rights instruments and de facto human rights practice, arguing that the focus on de jure instruments and legal discourse misses the significant effect of social movements and direct action that secure rights practice. De jure instruments may codify human rights and enumerate them as important, but they do not carry the authority of enforcement.

{"id": 685, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Ronald Reagan often spoke of America's divine purpose and of a mysterious plan behind the nation's founding. \"You can call it mysticism if you want to,\" he told the Conservative Political Action Conference in 1974, \"but I have always believed that there was some divine plan that placed this great continent between two oceans to be sought out by those who were possessed of an abiding love of freedom and a special kind of courage.\" These were remarks to which Reagan often returned. He repeated them almost verbatim as president before a television audience of millions for the Statue of Liberty centenary on July 4, 1986.\n\nWhen touching on such themes, Reagan echoed the work, and sometimes the phrasing, of occult scholar Manly P. Hall.\n\nFrom the dawn of Hall's career in the early 1920s until his death in 1990, the Los Angeles teacher wrote about America's \"secret destiny.\" The United States, in Hall's view, was a society that had been planned and founded by secret esoteric orders to spread enlightenment and liberty to the world.\n\nIn 1928, Hall attained underground fame when, at the remarkably young age of twenty-seven, he published \"The Secret Teachings of All Ages,\" a massive codex to the mystical and esoteric philosophies of antiquity. Exploring subjects from Native American mythology to Pythagorean mathematics to the geometry of ancient Egypt, this encyclopedia arcana remains the unparalleled guidebook to ancient symbols and esoteric thought. \"The Secret Teachings\" won the admiration of figures ranging from General John Pershing to Elvis Presley. Novelist Dan Brown cites it as a key source.\n\nAfter publishing his \"Great Book,\" Hall spent the rest of his life lecturing and writing within the walls of his Egypto-art deco campus, the Philosophical Research Society, in L.A.'s Griffith Park neighborhood. Hall called the place a \"mystery school\" in the mold of Pythagoras's ancient academy.\n\nIt was there in 1944 that the occult thinker produced a short work, one little known beyond his immediate circle. This book, \"The Secret Destiny of America,\" evidently caught the eye of Reagan, then a middling movie actor gravitating toward politics.\n\nHall's concise volume described how America was the product of a \"Great Plan\" for religious liberty and self-governance, launched by a hidden order of ancient philosophers and secret societies. In one chapter, Hall described a rousing speech delivered by a mysterious \"unknown speaker\" before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The \"strange man,\" wrote Hall, invisibly entered and exited the locked doors of the statehouse in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, delivering an oration that bolstered the wavering spirits of the delegates. \"God has given America to be free!\" commanded the mysterious speaker, urging the men to overcome their fears of being hanged or beheaded, and to seal destiny by signing the great document. Newly emboldened, the delegates rushed forward to add their names. They looked to thank the stranger only to discover that he had vanished from the locked room. Was this, Hall wondered, \"one of the agents of the secret Order, guarding and directing the destiny of America?\"\n\nAt a 1957 commencement address at his alma mater Eureka College, Reagan, then a corporate spokesman for General Electric, sought to inspire students with this leaf from occult history. \"This is a land of destiny,\" Reagan said, \"and our forefathers found their way here by some Divine system of selective service gathered here to fulfill a mission to advance man a further step in his climb from the swamps.\" Reagan then retold (without naming a source) the tale of Hall's unknown speaker. \"When they turned to thank the speaker for his timely words,\" Reagan concluded, \"he couldn't be found and to this day no one knows who he was or how he entered or left the guarded room.\" Reagan revived the story in 1981, when Parade magazine asked the president for a personal essay on what July 4 meant to him. Presidential aide Michael Deaver delivered the piece with a note saying, \"This Fourth of July message is the president's own words and written initially in the president's hand,\" on a yellow pad at Camp David. Reagan retold the legend of the unknown speaker\u2014this time using language very close to Hall's own: \"When they turned to thank him for his timely oratory, he was not to be found, nor could any be found who knew who he was or how he had come in or gone out through the locked and guarded doors.\"\n\nWhere did Hall uncover the tale that inspired a president? The episode originated as \"The Speech of the Unknown\" in a collection of folkloric stories about America's founding, published in 1847 under the title \"Washington and His Generals, or Legends of the Revolution\" by American social reformer and muckraker George Lippard.

{"id": 686, "ended": true, "length": 797, "text": "The New Jersey inheritance tax affects the recipients of bequests -- yes, the state will probably take a share of that windfall your favorite aunt left to you. New Jersey is one of a few states that collect both an inheritance tax and an estate tax. The state taxes estates on their overall value before bequests and gifts are made, then it also taxes some beneficiaries on the value of their specific bequests.\n\nWho Is Exempt From the New Jersey Inheritance Tax?\n\nNot every gift to every beneficiary is subject to New Jersey's inheritance tax. Most charitable organizations are exempt. Bequests valued at less than $500 are not taxed, nor are life insurance proceeds -- the gift must typically be conveyed via will or trust.\n\nThis means posthumous payments made from the New Jersey Public Employees Retirement System, the New Jersey Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund, and the New Jersey Police and Firemen's Retirement System are exempt, too. So are annuities paid to beneficiaries by the federal government under the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan or the Survivor Benefit Plan. Federal Civil Service Retirement benefits are also safe.\n\nImmediate family members can inherit without paying the tax. In New Jersey, these include spouses, parents, grandparents, and descendants -- children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of the deceased. New Jersey law also includes civil union partners and domestic partners in this category, called Class A beneficiaries.\n\nWho Is Not Exempt From the New Jersey Inheritance Tax?\n\nOther classes of beneficiaries must pay the state's inheritance tax but at a graduated tax rate.\n\nClass C beneficiaries include siblings, the spouse, widow or widower of a child of the decedent, and the surviving civil union partner of a child of the decedent. These individuals can receive up to $25,000 without paying an inheritance tax. Bequests exceeding $25,000 are taxed at 11 to 16 percent, depending on the gift's value. Only inheritances valued at more than $1.7 million are subject to the highest rate of 16 percent as of 2016.\n\nAll other beneficiaries fall into Class D. They pay 15 percent on the first $700,000 they receive, and 16 percent on anything above that amount as of 2016.\n\nYes, Class B is missing. The state legislature has eliminated this category.\n\nWhen Is the New Jersey Inheritance Tax Return and Any Required Payment Due?\n\nThe New Jersey inheritance tax return, Form IT-R for residents or Form IT-NR for nonresidents, must be filed with the state and the tax paid within eight months after the decedent's date of death. The state may grant a filing extension for the return of up to an additional four months, but the tax itself must be paid within eight months. An estate's executor can file one return for all beneficiaries, typically collecting the tax out of their inheritances.\n\nHow Is a New Jersey Inheritance Tax Lien Released?\n\nThe state automatically places liens against a decedent's property until inheritance taxes are paid, or it's established that the recipient of the property is exempt. Although Class A beneficiaries are not required to file a New Jersey inheritance tax return, they must file Form L-8 to secure the release of a New Jersey decedent's bank accounts, stocks, bonds and brokerage accounts. If the decedent held title to any New Jersey real estate, Form L-9, or Form L-9NR for a nonresident decedent must be filed to obtain a release from the state's lien.\n\nWhere Can I Find Additional Information About the New Jersey Inheritance Tax?\n\nRefer to the New Jersey Division of Taxation website for more information. See the State Inheritance Tax Chart for a comprehensive summary of inheritance tax laws among the states that collect them."}

The company claimed in a court filing that it was losing money on construction projects in South Carolina and Georgia, although it maintained that nuclear fuel and plant servicing operations remained \"very profitable.\"\n\nFurther Reading How China's army hacked America The construction cost overruns fall on nuclear power plants that would have contained Generation III+ AP1000 reactors, which Westinghouse designed with \"passive safety features,\" like using gravity and convective cooling, to make them simpler, easier to maintain, and more resistant to earthquakes, plane crashes, or electrical blackouts. According to The New York Times, the two projects are nearly three years overdue and have cost somewhere between $1 billion and $1.3 billion more than expected.\n\nThe two projects include the Alvin W. Vogtle generating station in Georgia, which was in the news in February 2015 for missing deadlines and for cost overruns, and South Carolina Gas & Electric's Virgil C. Summer plant in Jenkinsville, South Carolina, which has suffered similar setbacks.\n\nThe Times attributes the construction issues to inexperience on the part of the contractors, especially given how little new nuclear power plant construction had been underway in the previous decades. While Westinghouse was responsible for reactor design, a company called S&W was responsible for on-site construction, Westinghouse wrote in its court filing (PDF). But delays were inevitable: the reactor company claims that safety regulations passed to prevent terrorist attacks against targets like nuclear reactors forced redesign and relicensing of the two power plants, which \"created additional, unanticipated engineering challenges that resulted in increased costs and delays on the US AP1000 Projects.\"\n\nFrom there, a flurry of lawsuits were threatened between the various stakeholders in the agreement. \"To resolve existing and potential litigation, [Westinghouse] considered the feasibility of acquiring S&W,\" the company noted. \"WEC believed such an acquisition would allow the parties to re-baseline the projects and increase the likelihood of their success.\" But the generating station never got back on track.\n\nAccording to a press release from the company, Westinghouse obtained $800 million in debtor-in-possession financing to \"protect its core businesses during its reorganization.\" It's unclear how the construction on both projects will proceed, but the chairman of the Georgia Public Service Commission told the Times that if Westinghouse asks to re-certify the project, the commission would have to weigh that request against natural gas or renewable energy.\n\nWestinghouse is the manufacturer of 111 of the 450 operable nuclear reactors worldwide, according to court documents filed at Southern New York's federal bankruptcy court."}

Put a record on so you don't damage the needle, then swing it out over the record. Adjust the weight until it \"floats\" level above the record. Turn the weight indicator to \"0\". Now adjust the height until it is close to the surface of the record. This was 1.5 for me. Adjust the weight to 1.5 for just home listening, 3.5 for practicing and performance. Use an unpressed side of a 12\" or a 12\" with a large run- off to set the anti-skate. Put the needle on unpressed vinyl and adjust the skate (while spinning) so it stands still. On 1.5, it should be about 1.3. On 3.5, you can't adjust it high enough, so just crank it to the max.\n\nAfter much discussion on the bpm mailing list, the consensus on anti-skate settings is to set it at 0 if you scratch mix or at a number equal to the weight on the cartridge if you just listen to your records without touching them... The idea is that the anti-skate mechanism in the turntable is designed for normal record playing. A side note:"}

{"id": 697, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "If you ever go to Japan, you'll come to realize that almost all men, especially salarymen, don't have mustaches (or facial hair for that matter). Although shaving your mustache can sometimes cause trouble, having a mustache can be problematic in Japan. If you decided to go to work with a mustache your boss might not just give you a simple slap on the wrist, he might actually fire you. Sad, but true.\n\nBut how can this be? In a modern country such as Japan, shouldn't it be a society in which one can look past another's facial hair without judging (or firing you?). I'd like to take you on a mustache-canoe journey through the river that is the history of how facial hair functions in Japan, past and present. I'd also like to educate you on mustaches in general in Japan, just in case you end up in a heated mustache-related argument. Nobody is going to be teased about falling flattop on your facial hair on my watch.\n\nJapanese Mustache Vocabulary\n\nUnlike English, Japanese has only one word for each type of facial hair, excluding the eyebrows: HIGE. Lucky you! You've just learned how to say mustache, beard, sideburns, and whiskers in Japanese, all at once. If you found it to be more confusing than \"lucky\", don't worry, we use a different kanji for each hige:\n\nmustache \u9aed ( \u3072\u3052 )\n\ncheek hair \u9b1a ( \u3072\u3052 )\n\nchin \u9aef ( \u3072\u3052 )\n\nFurthermore, you can also say:\n\nmouth-hair kuchi hige \u53e3\u9aed ( \u304f\u3061\u3072\u3052 )\n\ncheek-hair hoohige \u982c\u9b1a ( \u307b\u304a\u3072\u3052 )\n\nchin-hair ago-hige \u984e\u9aef ( \u3042\u3054\u3072\u3052 )\n\nJust as a note, to save some word-space in this article, from here on out I'll use \"hige\" to quickly refer to mustaches, beards, sideburns, (and whiskers). So, please don't get confused whenever you see the word \"hige\". Memorize the meaning right now!!!\n\nLet's break down the words for each HIGE style: Mustache a.k.a. kuchi-hige is facial hair grown just above the upper lip and is the most common type of hige. For this popular mustache, there are three main styles. In Japanese, the \"handlebar mustache\" a.k.a. the \"Kaiser mustache\" is \u30ab\u30a4\u30bc\u30eb \u9aed ( \u3072\u3052 ) , toothbrush mustache is \u3061\u3087\u3073 \u9aed ( \u3072\u3052 ) , and the pencil-thin mustache is \u6ce5\u9c0c\u9aed ( \u3069\u3058\u3087\u3046\u3072\u3052 ) .\n\nThere are other types of hige out there besides these, of course. Let's take a look at some of the more interesting ones.\n\nAgo-hige is the collection of facial hair grown on the chin, upper lip, lower cheeks, and neck. The most famous style of this is most likely to be the \"goatee\" and is translated into yagi-hige \u5c71\u7f8a\u9aef ( \u3084\u304e\u3072\u3052 ) (goat beard).\n\nThis can be taken a step further, too. Nothing says \"I love Japan\" more than trimming the hair on your chin into the shape of Mt. Fuji. Not surprisingly, this is called Fuji-hige \u5bcc\u58eb\u9aef ( \u3075\u3058\u3072\u3052 ) .\n\nHoo-hige is facial hair grown on the sides of the face and in front of the ears. It's not exactly the same thing as sideburns, however. In Japanese \"sideburns\" get separated into two different categories. (Remember, \"hoo\" means cheek so hoo-hige is the part of the sideburn that starts extending outward over your cheek.) The part of the sideburn that is directly beside your ear is called momiage \u3082\u307f\u3042\u3052 ( ) . It's difficult to distinguish exactly where momiage end and where hoo-hige begin, so some people just call them nagaimomiage \u9577 ( \u306a\u304c ) \u3044\u3082\u307f\u3042\u3052, which means \"long momiage.\"\n\nAnother very common hige style is the combination of the mustache and the goatee, which is called \u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9 \u9aed ( \u3072\u3052 ) , \u56f2 ( \u304b\u3053 ) \u307f, or \u30ab\u30fc\u30eb\u304a\u3058\u3055\u3093\u306e"}

The Blue Jackets defeated the Avalanche 4-3. (Photo by Doug Pensinger/Getty Images)\n\nThis was not how it was supposed to play out for Brandon Saad with the Columbus Blue Jackets.\n\nAfter proving too rich for the Chicago Blackhawks' salary structure, Saad was traded to the Blue Jackets, who signed the young two-time Stanley Cup winner to a 6-year, $36-million contract. The hockey world braced its collective self for Saad's offensive to explode playing on a line with center Ryan Johansen.\n\nInstead, Saad is now skating on the Blue Jackets' fourth line. Oh, and Johansen's not even a center at the moment.\n\nWelcome to life under John Tortorella.\n\nSaad's numbers aren't terrible: 9 goals, 7 assists in 27 games. But his stats have fallen off a cliff lately: No goals since Nov. 19, and just three points in that span. He hasn't tallied a point in his last four games, and didn't register a shot in consecutive games against the Montreal Canadiens and Florida Panthers.\n\nHis ice time dropped to a season-low 13:35 in the Jackets' win over the Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday night.\n\nFrom Aaron Portzline of the Columbus Dispatch:\n\nTortorella said on Saturday that he put Saad on fourth line because Saad has been struggling, but also because he wanted to spread some offensive potential across the Blue Jackets' lineup. Don't expect Saad to stay on the fourth line very long.\n\nAs for Johansen, playing wing for the first time since his rookie season with Brandon Dubinsky as his center?\n\n\"I switched the line around, and at first we had (Brandon Dubinsky) on left wing and Joey in the middle,\" Tortorella said. \"I wanted them to play together when we switched the lines around.\n\n\"I think Dubi feels more comfortable down low. There's a lot more responsibility (at center ice). As it went on, I saw joey moving his legs more on the wing than at center. That's a constant concentration for Joey, is to keep his legs moving. It's still not consistent enough, but I see it more on the wing. I just saw his legs moving so I kept him there. We'll see what happens with it.\"\n\nThe experiments continue against the Los Angeles Kings at home on Tuesday night. We'll see if offensive power houses Gregory Campbell and Michael Chaput bust Saad's slump.\n\nMeanwhile, Artem Anisimov, a key part of the Saad trade for the Blackhawks, has been a major cog on one of the NHL's best lines, helping to power Patrick Kane to a 22-game point streak.\n\n____\n\nGreg Wyshynski is a writer for Yahoo Sports.

Do we find thoughtful analyses of gun control laws? Nope. Or discussions on the 2nd Amendment from a constitutional perspective? Not likely.\n\nWhat will we find? Grainy video of the shooter from when he was in kindergarten or when she played Cinderella in 5th grade. Pictures from his high school prom or with her first car. Letters he wrote to his spurned lover or texts she sent to her friends.\n\nWhat we find are media outlets not covering these events, but socially influencing their preponderance, as Charlie Brooker in the essential video below (and Roger Ebert after it) both argue.\n\n\nLet me tell you a story. The day after Columbine, I was interviewed for the Tom Brokaw news program. The reporter had been assigned a theory and was seeking sound bites to support it. \"Wouldn't you say,\" she asked, \"that killings like this are influenced by violent movies?\" No, I said, I wouldn't say that. \"But what about 'Basketball Diaries'?\" she asked. \"Doesn't that have a scene of a boy walking into a school with a machine gun?\" The obscure 1995 Leonardo Di Caprio movie did indeed have a brief fantasy scene of that nature, I said, but the movie failed at the box office (it grossed only $2.5 million), and it's unlikely the Columbine killers saw it. The reporter looked disappointed, so I offered her my theory. \"Events like this,\" I said, \"if they are influenced by anything, are influenced by news programs like your own. When an unbalanced kid walks into a school and starts shooting, it becomes a major media event. Cable news drops ordinary programming and goes around the clock with it. The story is assigned a logo and a theme song; these two kids were packaged as the Trench Coat Mafia. The message is clear to other disturbed kids around the country: If I shoot up my school, I can be famous. The TV will talk about nothing else but me. Experts will try to figure out what I was thinking. The kids and teachers at school will see they shouldn't have messed with me. I'll go out in a blaze of glory.\" In short, I said, events like Columbine are influenced far less by violent movies than by CNN, the NBC Nightly News and all the other news media, who glorify the killers in the guise of \"explaining\" them. I commended the policy at the Sun-Times, where our editor said the paper would no longer feature school killings on Page 1. The reporter thanked me and turned off the camera. Of course the interview was never used. They found plenty of talking heads to condemn violent movies, and everybody was happy.\n\nInterestingly, Roger Ebert eloquently expressed a nearly identical sentiment in his review of Elephant Now, let me be clear: I do not blame CNN for mass shootings in America. There are too many forces at play, with the NRA and our country's disdain for sound gun control front and center.\n\nHowever, do I blame CNN and other networks for sensationalizing and glorifying these events, making it more likely for them to happen within an environment which makes them all too easy to perpetrate in America?\n\nYou're God-damn right I do.\n\n--\u00a7--\n\n\nDavid Harris-Gershon is author of the memoir What Do You Buy the Children of the Terrorist Who Tried to Kill Your Wife?, just out from Oneworld Publications.\n\nFollow @David_EHG"}
{"id": 706, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "advertising\n\n[Update: Xbox One VR confirmed by developer!]\n\nSurprising absolutely no one, Microsoft has a new version of the Xbox One in development that will be announced next month at E3 2016. We already know unofficially that a similar thing is happening on the Sony front with a new, more powerful and 4K-ready PlayStation 4 (codenamed \"Neo\") as well.\n\nOn the Xbox front however, there's yet another Xbox model coming slightly further down the line according the latest insider leaks, and from what we know about it, the earlier conflicting reports about whether or not the next Xbox would be a new console or an incremental upgrade now make more sense.\n\nFirst, let's recap. In response to rumors over the last few months of the upcoming \"PlayStation 4.5\" Microsoft's Phil Spencer warned gamers and industry pundits in April to not expect any sort of incremental Xbox One upgrade from their camp. \"If we're going to move forward, I want to move forward in big numbers,\" said Spencer while speaking at the Build Developers Conference earlier this year.\n\nLess than two weeks later, FCC filings from Microsoft suggested that new Xbox hardware could indeed be on the way very soon and just a few weeks ago that was followed up with the company hinting a reveal about taking gamers \"beyond\" the Xbox One (they've been teasing a bigger push and cross-platform support with Windows 10). Despite the 'will they, won't they' aspect of it all, three years in for the Xbox One lifecycle seems the right time for a slim model (the Xbox One is stupidly big and ugly after all) much like they did with multiple variants of the Xbox 360. Recent reports said as much as well, that there could be an Xbox One slim ready in time for an unveiling during the Microsoft Xbox E3 2016 press conference.\n\nadvertising\n\nToday, Kotaku has confirmed that with multiple sources and have also learned much more interesting details about the future of Microsoft's console gaming platform.\n\n2 New Xbox Models Coming in Next 2 Years\n\nFirstly, there's indeed a new compact Xbox One model coming by this holiday season and it's believed to feature 2TBs of hard drive space, answering at least one of the issues of the base model. This cheaper, smaller Xbox One will be showcased at E3 and unveiled during the Xbox presentation on Monday, June 13 at 12:30PM EST.\n\nThat much anyone could have and probably already has speculated upon, but the more interesting news is on what's coming next. Kotaku's sources (three separate sources, mind you) reveal that the unnamed 2017 Xbox console is codenamed \"Scorpio\" and will feature the upgrade fans are waiting for. It'll support a more powerful GPU for 4K support and could potentially support the Oculus Rift virtual reality hardware. It's possible given that information that this 2017 Xbox will be more powerful than the incremental PlayStation 4 \"Neo\" system coming up this fall. Come 2017, Microsoft may finally have the leg up on their rival in terms of home console power - but that assumes PlayStation won't have something similar by then. Specs on this new Xbox haven't been finalized but it was reportedly shown to select third-party publishers last week.\n\nadvertising\n\nThis is where I say \"I told ya so!\" The lack of Xbox VR news has been a nagging question since PlayStation first teased their own VR hardware (previously known as Project Morpheus) and Microsoft only had HoloLens augmented reality as a response. Microsoft and Oculus VR did partner up to include Xbox One controllers as a pack-in with the Rift headset so it seemed a given to me that one day the Oculus Rift would be usable on the Xbox console. There's just no way Microsoft (who again, claims to be all about the PC - more on this shortly!) allows Sony to have exclusivity on the home console VR front when the Xbox One is miles behind on sales compared to the PlayStation 4.\n\nProject Helix\n\nKotaku only knows that there are reportedly talks taking place between Microsoft and Oculus at this point, but the entire strategy is codenamed \"Project Helix\" with the goal of bringing the Xbox platform and Windows operating system together. And yes, that means that Xbox exclusives should finally get the proper PC treatment, including games like Halo 5: Guardians which only came out on Xbox One. We wouldn't be surprised to see it announced for PC in the near future though...\n\nThe messaging here is that Microsoft is seemingly moving towards what Phil Spencer was hinting at for months, that the console space will continue converging with the PC model in that they'll get incremental upgrades so they're never left too far behind when new hardware and technologies emerge. Think iPhones and Android devices which iterate annually but support the same OS. That's the Windows 10 gaming future across PC and Xbox consoles.\n\nadvertising\n\nStay tuned for more updates in the coming weeks alongside our"}

A 1986 law lets the Feds read emails that have been stored on a server for at least six months.\n\nThe Electronic Communications Privacy Act was enacted long before everybody had email, but the government says the law lets it access 180-day old email without a warrant. Here's the relevant text of the law:\n\nA governmental entity may require the disclosure by a provider of electronic communications services of the contents of a wire or electronic communication that has been in electronic storage in an electronic communications system for more than one hundred and eighty days by the means available under subsection (b) of this section.\n\nIn May, the ACLU got its hands on the government's justification for using this law to gather six-month-old emails. Here's the justification from the 2012 Version of FBI Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide, which the ACLU got through a FOIA request:\n\nIn enacting the ECPA, Congress concluded that customers may not retain a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" in information sent to network providers. . . [I]f the contents of an unopened message are kept beyond six months or stored on behalf of the customer after the e-mail has been received or opened, it should be treated the same as a business record in the hands of a third party, such as an accountant or attorney. In that case, the government may subpoena the records from the third party without running afoul of either the Fourth or Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment protects Americans from unreasonable searches and often requires police to get search warrants before encroaching on your privacy. Americans should be appalled that the government can snoop into their old emails without such a warrant.\n\nPresident Obama said today that \"nobody's listening to the content of people's phone calls.\" However, the Feds might be reading a very private six-month-old email \u2014 and they don't even need permission from a judge to do so.\n\nThere is a bright spot, though.

Earchiel Johnson | PW\n\nAs part of an ongoing series, \"Red Century,\" the New York Times published an article April 30 by 81year-old liberal social critic Vivian Gornick, entitled \"They Were True Believers.\" In this piece Gornick, a long time writer for the Village Voice, gives a moving portrayal of the rich and fulfilling life she and so many of her neighbors, family and friends experienced in the Communist Party in the 1930's, 40's and 50's. But she claims the party was destroyed and became a relic of history in 1956 when Nikita Khrushchev denounced Soviet leader Josef Stalin.\n\nAs someone who joined the Party much later, in 1970, I beg to differ. I joined the party after five years of activism against the war in Vietnam. Vietnamese communists, were a critical part of the leadership of the movement for national independence and sovereignty in their country. They were hardly deterred by whatever Khrushchev had to say about Stalin.\n\nNeither were the thousands of American Communists who opposed the war, including two of the \"Fort Hood Three,\" the first American soldiers to refuse deployment to Vietnam.\n\nNor were the many dynamic leaders that I met in the CPUSA. They had been steeled in the mass struggles to organize industrial unions, overcome Jim Crow racism and build unity against fascism before and during WWII. They had survived the terrible repression targeting the Party during the McCarthy era.\n\nGornick does not mention this repression officially conducted by the U.S. government, its collaborating employers and propagandists and much of the press including the New York Times. She does not acknowledge in the Times article the anti-Communist hysteria aimed at destroying the labor movement and intimidating all working class, democratic, and progressive forces during the 1950's. The campaign was especially dangerous because it made acceptable the idea of possible war against the Soviet Union. The damage done by this campaign far exceeded Khrushchev's speech in weakening the size and influence of the Party.\n\nGornick also does not mention the many leaders and ordinary members who, after the Khrushchev speech, risked so much, including their reputations and jobs, by continuing their membership in the party.\n\nI had a close friendship and working relationship with one of those leaders, George Meyers, who served 38 months in federal prison because of his Communist beliefs. Upon his release in 1956, he was besieged by reporters who asked him, \"George, now that Khrushchev has denounced Stalin, are you going to quit the Communist Party?.\"\n\nTo this, George replied, \"Stalin did not recruit me into the party and nothing he did is going to make me quit!\n\n\"I joined the Communist Party because of the class struggle in the United States,\" he recalled later in a 1996 interview in the Baltimore Sun. \"That's why I never had any problems with all those foreign ups and downs.\"\n\nMeyers had been a prominent labor leader in Maryland and had organized a 10,000-member local of the Textile Workers Union at the Celanese plant in Cumberland where he worked for 22 \u00bd cents an hour seven days a week.\n\nIn the days before Occupational Safety and Health laws the textile fibers in the mill destroyed the lungs of nearly all the workers. Meyers outlived his union brothers and sisters because he got off the shop floor when he was elected president of the local. Later, as president of the Maryland-District of Columbia Congress of Industrial Organizations, he led the drive that organized 37,000 workers at the Glenn L. Martin aircraft plant. He insisted that 7,000 African Americans be integrated into the work force.\n\nDuring World War II Meyers had waived his deferment as a labor leader and served in the Air Force.\n\nDuring his 1951 trial under the Smith Act, the trial that resulted in his imprisonment, prosecutors pressed Meyers to name his comrades. He said he could not do that, \"but, I can tell you who recruited me into the Party.\"\n\n\"Who was that?\" they asked, moving closer to the defendant to get this vital piece of information.\n\n\"The Celanese Corporation of America!\" George declared in his booming voice.\n\nLike many other Communists George went into the South in the early 1960's, long after the Khrushchev revelations, to help build the civil rights movement. Until his death in 1999, he continued to serve on the party's national board and as head of its labor department.\n\nIn his last major speech before his assassination, delivered at the 1968 Freedomways banquet honoring the great scholar Dr. W. E. B DuBois, who late in life had joined the Party, Dr. Martin Luther King recognized the contributions of the party and denounced \"our irrational, obsessive anti-communism.\"\n\nIn the 1970s, '80s and '90s, the party was extremely active in the"}

The Amadai looks like a porcupine with the curled up scales, it's deep fried till it's crispy on the outside (the scales are edible), I had a tiny chunk of the flesh and was pleasantly surprised by how moist and light it was.

Just writing about it makes me want to go back to Suzuike, like right now!\n\nOther dishes that I like from my previous visits includes\n\nOne of the rarer dishes is the Tuna Kama Sushi, it's bascially the cheek and collar of tuna. IF there's a part of tuna that taste better than the prized toro (tuna belly), it's the kama. Kama has equal amount of fat content as toro, so it's very soft and melts in your mouth. But on top of that, it also has a higher concentrated, more robust flavor than the belly section. There is only a few pieces per fish and it's rare for even an average sushi restaurant in japan to have that. Lucky for us, Suzuike does it well, the sushi is so juicy and literally melts in your mouth.\n\nFoie gras sushi ; Foie gras cooked to perfected with the sides pan fried and inside soft. Wagyu steak is flavorful and tender. The Kambachi & Botan Ebi Carpaccio with Italian White Truffle Oil & Sea Salt is one of my favorites, sea salt brings out the subtle sweetness of fresh sashimi and the truffle oil bring aroma and add depth to the dish.\n\nI like Suzuike for their food, ambience and excellent service!

He has done so through his various blogs and Internet outlets, in speeches, and in articles. He is currently on tour in the United States promoting his most recent book, entitled, 'The Wandering Who.'\n\nWith this letter, we call for the disavowal of Atzmon by fellow Palestinian organizers, as well as Palestine solidarity activists, and allies of the Palestinian people, and note the dangers of supporting Atzmon's political work and writings and providing any platforms for their dissemination. We do so as Palestinian organizers and activists, working across continents, campaigns, and ideological positions.\n\nAtzmon's politics rest on one main overriding assertion that serves as springboard for vicious attacks on anyone who disagrees with his obsession with \"Jewishness\". He claims that all Jewish politics is \"tribal,\" and essentially, Zionist. Zionism, to Atzmon, is not a settler-colonial project, but a trans-historical \"Jewish\" one, part and parcel of defining one's self as a Jew. Therefore, he claims, one cannot self-describe as a Jew and also do work in solidarity with Palestine, because to identify as a Jew is to be a Zionist. We could not disagree more. Indeed, we believe Atzmon's argument is itself Zionist because it agrees with the ideology of Zionism and Israel that the only way to be a Jew is to be a Zionist.\n\nPalestinians have faced two centuries of orientalist, colonialist and imperialist domination of our native lands. And so as Palestinians, we see such language as immoral and completely outside the core foundations of humanism, equality and justice, on which the struggle for Palestine and its national movement rests. As countless Palestinian activists and organizers, their parties, associations and campaigns, have attested throughout the last century, our struggle was never, and will never be, with Jews, or Judaism, no matter how much Zionism insists that our enemies are the Jews. Rather, our struggle is with Zionism, a modern European settler colonial movement, similar to movements in many other parts of the world that aim to displace indigenous people and build new European societies on their lands.\n\nWe reaffirm that there is no room in this historic and foundational analysis of our struggle for any attacks on our Jewish allies, Jews, or Judaism; nor denying the Holocaust; nor allying in any way shape or form with any conspiracy theories, far-right, orientalist, and racist arguments, associations and entities. Challenging Zionism, including the illegitimate power of institutions that support the oppression of Palestinians, and the illegitimate use of Jewish identities to protect and legitimize oppression, must never become an attack on Jewish identities, nor the demeaning and denial of Jewish histories in all their diversity.\n\nIndeed, we regard any attempt to link and adopt antisemitic or racist language, even if it is within a self-described anti-imperialist and anti-Zionist politics, as reaffirming and legitimizing Zionism. In addition to its immorality, this language obscures the fundamental role of imperialism and colonialism in destroying our homeland, expelling its people, and sustaining the systems and ideologies of oppression, apartheid and occupation. It leaves one squarely outside true solidarity with Palestine and its people.\n\nThe goal of the Palestinian people has always been clear: self determination. And we can only exercise that inalienable right through liberation, the return of our refugees (the absolute majority of our people) and achieving equal rights to all through decolonization. As such, we stand with all and any movements that call for justice, human dignity, equality, and social, economic, cultural and political rights. We will never compromise the principles and spirit of our liberation struggle. We will not allow a false sense of expediency to drive us into alliance with those who attack, malign, or otherwise attempt to target our political fraternity with all liberation struggles and movements for justice.\n\nAs Palestinians, it is our collective responsibility, whether we are in Palestine or in exile, to assert our guidance of our grassroots liberation struggle. We must protect the integrity of our movement, and to do so we must continue to remain vigilant that those for whom we provide platforms actually speak to its principles.\n\nWhen the Palestinian people call for self-determination and decolonization of our homeland, we do so in the promise and hope of a community founded on justice, where all are free, all are equal and all are welcome.\n\nUntil liberation and return.\n\nSigned:\n\nAli Abunimah\n\nNaseer Aruri, Professor Emeritus, University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth\n\nOmar Barghouti, human rights activist\n\nHatem Bazian,"}

After she refused to drop the rape charges, he concocted a scheme that landed her in jail for seven months, making it seem as though Ms. Sumasar was the likely perpetrator of a series of brazen armed robberies, for which she was accused of impersonating a police officer.\n\nAt his trial in State Supreme Court in Queens, prosecutors produced evidence that Mr. Ramrattan cajoled and extorted witnesses to falsely testify that she had robbed them. He even staged fake crime scenes, prosecutors said, in which he planted evidence, handcuffing one of Ms. Sumasar's supposed victims to a pole and planting several bullets at the scene of one of the imaginary crimes.\n\nBefore Mr. Ramrattan was sentenced on Wednesday, Ms. Sumasar delivered a stinging victim impact statement, noting that he showed no remorse and was so intent on revenge that he would have stopped at nothing to destroy her. \"I don't have words for you,\" she said as as he stared ahead, stone-faced, while she spoke. \"You are pure evil. You are a sociopath. You need help.\"\n\n\"Someone needs to put a stop to your madness,\" she added.\n\nDuring her seven months in jail, awaiting a robbery trial, Ms. Sumasar, a former Morgan Stanley analyst, was separated from her young daughter. She lost her business, and her house went into foreclosure. Her bail was set at $1 million, which she could not afford. Mr. Ramrattan, meanwhile, was free until an informant came forward in late 2010 and exposed his plot.\n\nMr. Ramrattan was convicted in November of a series of charges, including rape, conspiracy and perjury. The nearly monthlong trial offered two opposing plot lines that were seemingly irreconcilable. Prosecutors portrayed Ms. Sumasar as a single mother duped by a wily confidence man intent on malicious vengeance. But the defense characterized her as a dejected lover who had turned on Mr. Ramrattan after he said he was leaving her to return to his wife and family.\n\nMembers of the jury said the guilty verdict was predicated on their acceptance of Ms. Sumasar's account of being bound with duct tape and viciously raped by Mr. Ramrattan, which apparently gave him a motive to create his ruse.\n\nIn his plea for leniency, Mr. Ramrattan insisted that he was innocent, saying that he had spent years helping the police solve cases as an informant. \"I stand before you with no choice but to accept what is going to happen,\" he said. \"Think about all the cases I made over the years, the rape victims I assisted.

Bush in 2006 and agreed to stay through more than two years of President Obama's first term, repeatedly declined to criticize the policymakers who devised a response to the September 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead, including the U.S. Ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens.\n\n\"Frankly, had I been in the job at the time, I think my decisions would have been just as theirs were,\" said Gates, now the chancellor of the College of William and Mary.\n\n\"We don't have a ready force standing by in the Middle East, and so getting somebody there in a timely way would have been very difficult, if not impossible.\" he explained.\n\nSuggestions that we could have flown a fighter jet over the attackers to \"scare them with the noise or something,\" Gates said, ignored the \"number of surface to air missiles that have disappeared from [former Libyan leader] Qaddafi's arsenals.\"\n\n\"I would not have approved sending an aircraft, a single aircraft, over Benghazi under those circumstances,\" he said.\n\nAnother suggestion posed by some critics of the administration, to, as Gates said, \"send some small number of special forces or other troops in without knowing what the environment is, without knowing what the threat is, without having any intelligence in terms of what is actually going on on the ground, would have been very dangerous.\"\n\n\"It's sort of a cartoonish impression of military capabilities and military forces,\" he said. \"The one thing that our forces are noted for is planning and preparation before we send people in harm's way, and there just wasn't time to do that.\"\n\nGates said he could not speak to allegations that the State Department refused requests for additional security in the months prior to the attack. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been increasingly targeted for criticism by Republicans for her handling of the crisis and the government's response, with some even raising the possibility that the State Department engineered a coverup to protect her political future.\n\nBut when Gates was asked whether he thought that might be a possibility, he replied flatly, \"No.\"\n\n\"I worked with Secretary Clinton pretty closely for two and a half years, and I wouldn't want to try and be somebody...trying to convince her to say something she did not think was true,\" he said, adding that he has not spoken with Clinton about the events in Benghazi.\n\nGates also defended the administration's circumspect response to the ongoing civil war in Syria, saying that despite the obviously vexing threat of Syrian disintegration, it would be a \"mistake\" to think America should - or even could - play a more muscular role in shaping the outcome.\n\n\"I believe that we have misjudged the Arab Spring and the Arab revolutions,\" Gates said. \"We tend to forget that if you look back over the last 200, 250 years, the history of revolutions is not a pretty one.\"\n\n\"I think in all of these countries, including Syria, you have the threat of civil war, the threat of these countries falling apart,\" he said. \"And for us to think we can influence or determine the outcome of that, I think, is a mistake. I thought it was a mistake in Libya. And I think it is a mistake in Syria.\"\n\nWhile calls for outright military intervention - \"boots on the ground\" - have not gained any traction among policymakers on either side of the aisle, many have suggested arming the rebels working to unseat Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The United States is already providing nonlethal assistance to some rebel groups in Syria, and the administration has signaled that it is revisiting its earlier opposition to sending arms and munitions to rebel groups.\n\nGates, however, warned that \"caution, particularly in terms of arming these groups and in terms of U.S. military involvement, is in order.\""}

Please leave your email here and we will contact you if or when more parkas are available! Name Email * In the meantime, you might be interested products we currently have in stock \u2013 REI Windbreakers from Palmer Station, Antarctica or a US Antarctic Program Patch (the same one featured on Antarctic Program parkas). This is a used Canada Goose down parka, made exclusively for the official United States Antarctic Program and affectionately named \"Big Red\" by Antarctic researchers. This parka is an Antarctic Program exclusive version of the popular Canada Goose 4565M \"Expedition Parka\", which sells new for $995.00 USD. These are the closest available parkas to \"Big Red\" currently for sale on Amazon:\n\n\n\"Big Red\" is issued by the US Antarctic Program to all scientists and staff serving at the two largest American research stations in Antarctica, McMurdo Base and South Pole Station. The parkas for sale here have been sold as surplus by the Antarctic Program, and were sourced from their New Zealand clothing warehouse and an Emergency Cold Weather Gear cache at the South Pole.\n\nThe \"Big Red\" Parkas' Story\n\nPropelled by their success in providing jackets to the Antarctic Program, Canada Goose has become a major luxury winterwear brand known for producing the highest-quality parkas in the world. In fact, their success is so tied to this jacket that their signature \"Canada Goose Arctic Program\" patch is copied from the official \"United States Antarctic Program\" patches featured on Big Red. The closest civilian-available equivalent to this jacket is the Expedition parka, and until now there was no way for civilians to obtain the original Antarctic model.\n\nEvery year. over 1,000 members of the Antarctic Program wear Big Red throughout Antarctica, from the coastline to the frozen plateau of the South Pole. The parkas available here have all seen service on-continent, and after the Summer 2016 Antarctic research season were sold as surplus by the Antarctic Program.\n\nParka Conditions: These parkas have experienced some of the harshest conditions in the world, and will have varying signs of wear depending on how many seasons they were worn, what Antarctic bases they served at, and who wore them. We have professionally refurbished these parkas by fixing all major defects, inspecting each one, and ensuring that each parka is 100% wearable and functional. We have graded the parkas as Fair, Good, and Very Good depending on the overall wear and fading of the parka, and priced accordingly. Example photos are shown in the listing, but individual parka's features and condition will vary. The grades are described as follows: Fair \u2013 The parka may show color fading and obvious wear from service in Antarctica. Scuffs, stains, or small rips may be present, and there may be evidence of field repairs done by the Antarctic Program as well as one or more visible patches from our tailor. All major flaws have been fixed. Good \u2013 The parka is in good condition, without major tears or damage, but may have general signs of wear, fading, visible (but not excessive) patches, repairs or minor stains/imperfections. Very Good \u2013 The parka is in excellent condition, with minimal fading and minor signs of wear, and no major patches or signs of repair.\n\nINDIVIDUAL PARKAS WILL VARY!\n\nEach one of these parkas is a unique piece of Antarctic history, with a story to tell! The parka that you receive will have tags branded either Canada Goose or Snow Goose (the previous brand name of Canada Goose), depending on the parka's age. The hood will feature a white or brown faux fur ruff or, in some cases, authentic Coyote fur. Parka conditions, as described above, are based on overall condition \u2013 some parkas, of any condition, may need to be dry-cleaned.\n\nYou will receive a randomly-selected parka of the size and condition you choose . The example photos shown in the image gallery are representative examples of each parka condition \u2013 due to the uniqueness of each parka, variations may be present depending on the parka you receive.\n\n\"Big Red\" Parka Features\n\nThese parkas feature multi-layered down insulation, multiple pockets (both interior and exterior), wind skirt, and fur hood trim (Coyote fur or synthetic, depending on variation). There are also several Antarctic Program exclusive features not available on civilian parkas, including a square reflector on the back meant for use during the long Antarctic night, velcro for a name patch, and the official USAP chest patch replacing the Canada Goose logo, which reads \"National Science Foundation / United States Antarctic Program\".\n"}

Below is an overview of properties that may be set on this object. Any other properties on this object are passed directly to the fetch method (see below). fetch The function to use for fetching the AJAX results. By default, window.fetch() is used, unless you use a jQuery build. If you use a jQuery build, it will automatically replace the default with a wrapper that uses $.ajax() internally. If you don't use a jQuery build, you are encouraged to ship a polyfill for window.fetch() , because not all browsers support this yet (or you can always specify this property to implement custom fetch logic).\n\n\nIf you implement this callback yourself, make sure you can accept the same parameters as window.fetch() . In addition, you will receive a third parameter which matches the parameter to the query() function documented below.\n\n\nMake sure you return a Promise that resolves to either a Response object, an Array with result items, or an object with a results array and an optional more boolean. The latter case is further documented on the query() function below. formatError Function that returns an HTML-formatted error message in case of an AJAX error. By default, Selectivity.Locale.ajaxError is used. The function receives two parameters: term and error . The first is the term being searched for while the latter is the error object that resulted from the failed request. Please be aware that because the function returns raw HTML, you are responsible for properly escaping any output to prevent XSS attacks. minimumInputLength An integer that specifies the minimum amount of characters required before an actual AJAX query will be performed. params Function that should return an object with additional query parameters to be added to the URL. Receives term and offset parameters. The term is a search term to search for and the offset is an integer of results that should be skipped for pagination. quietMillis Number of milliseconds to wait before submitting AJAX requests when the user is entering a search term. It is advised to use some number around 200 to 300 (milliseconds) to not delay results too much, while not submitting too many requests while the user is typing. url URL to send the AJAX requests to. This can be given either as a string or as a function returning a string. If a function is given, it is passed an options object with offset and term properties, just like the query method documented below. Note the URL does not need to contain (all) query parameters, as those can be specified using the params option.\n\nallowClear Boolean Set to true to allow the selection to be cleared. This option only applies to single-value inputs.\n\n\nIf you have used a <select> element to initialize the Selectivity instance, this option defaults to true unless the element has a required attribute.\n\nbackspace Highlights BeforeDelete Boolean If set to true , when the user enters a backspace while there is no text in the search field but there are selected items, the last selected item will be highlighted and when a second backspace is entered the item is deleted. If false , the item gets deleted on the first backspace. The default value is false .\n\ncloseOnSelect Boolean Set to false to keep the dropdown open after the user has selected an item. This is useful if you want to allow the user to quickly select multiple items. The default value is true .\n\ncreateTokenItem Function Function to create a new item from a user's search term. This is used to turn the term into an item when dropdowns are disabled and the user presses Enter. It is also used by the default tokenizer to create items for individual tokens. The function receives a token parameter which is the search term (or part of a search term) to create an item for and must return an item object with id and text properties or null if no token can be created from the term. The default is a function that returns an item where the ID and text both match the term for any non-empty string and which returns null otherwise.\n\n\nThis option only applies to multiple-value inputs.\n\ndata Object or Array Initial selection data to set.

The suit also seeks injunctive relief to prevent \"further illegal conduct\" by Microsoft.\n\nThursday's lawsuit is the latest in a long line of antitrust attacks on Microsoft, stretching back to 1995, when the Justice Department won a consent decree from the software giant in which it promised to behave fairly with competitors. Since then, Microsoft has been dogged by accusations of market abuse from rivals and authorities, including claims that it tried to knock Netscape Communications out of the browser market. Those charges led to a federal appeals court decision in 2001 finding the company had illegally abused its monopoly in desktop operating systems, followed by a settlement that many observers saw as a slap on the wrist.\n\nEchoes of Netscape rang through Thursday's suit from RealNetworks.\n\n\"Our case is based on many of the same types of Microsoft conduct that have already (been) declared to be illegal--such as failure to disclose interface information and imposing restrictions on PC makers--as well as a broad course of additional predatory conduct,\" Kimball said.\n\nReal said its lawsuit is complementary to the European Commission's ongoing investigation of Microsoft business practices. Real is cooperating with that inquiry.\n\nIn a statement, Microsoft responded that key allegations of the suit appeared to conflict with evidence of strong competition in the digital media market.\n\n\"RealNetworks' legal action today is unfortunate and particularly surprising given the intense competition in the digital media marketplace,\" Microsoft said. \"The facts are clear. There is vibrant competition in this marketplace and Real Networks' own reported growth shows that they have thrived on Windows and many other operating system platforms. Computer manufacturers are free to install and promote any media player on new PCs. Consumers are free to use any media player--and many consumers use several different media players.\"\n\nThe charges\n\nReal's 64-page complaint accuses Microsoft of \"tying\" its Windows Media Player to its Windows operating system, shutting out competitors such as Real and instantly achieving\n\n\n\"virtually universal distribution.\" From October 2001 to March 2003, for example, Microsoft's \"tying\" ensured that Windows Media Player was preinstalled on about 95 percent of PCs shipped, the suit reads. By contrast, it continues, RealNetworks' digital media player was preinstalled on less than 2 percent of the estimated 207 million new PCs shipped.\n\nRealNetworks said Microsoft has failed to share important information about the Windows code, thus hurting the performance of its RealPlayer product. For example, Microsoft refused to disclose details about certain security features, preventing Real from using them directly, according to the lawsuit.\n\nOther charges allege that Microsoft used contractual restrictions and financial incentives to \"force PC makers to accept Windows PC operating systems with the bundled Windows Media Player and to restrict the ability of PC makers to preinstall or promote competing digital media players.\"\n\nAccording to the suit, PC makers told Real that their contracts with Microsoft kept them from removing or changing the status of a Windows Media Player; promoting RealOne subscription services during the first run of a new PC; and providing a desktop icon for Real Networks. \"Microsoft's agreements with PC makers are exclusionary and anticompetitive,\" the suit concludes.\n\nThe suit also says Microsoft's pricing practices stifle competition. It alleges that Microsoft effectively forced competitors to provide free versions of their software to compete with Windows Media Player--a practice that has resulted in significant losses for RealNetworks. \"Microsoft's below cost pricing, separately or together with Microsoft's other exclusionary conduct, poses a dangerous probability of creating a monopoly in the digital media markets,\" RealNetworks said in the filing.\n\n'Knifing the baby'\n\nThe suit is just the latest legal headache for Microsoft stemming from its efforts in digital media. Start-up Burst.com has filed a patent infringement suit against the software giant, accusing Microsoft of stealing the technology it uses in the latest version of its digital media software, Windows Media 9. And digital rights management developer InterTrust Technologies has filed a patent suit over security locks in Microsoft's media software to prevent unauthorized copying.\n\nAnd the story stretches back much farther.\n\nRob Glaser, a former Microsoft executive, started RealNetworks a decade ago, quickly establishing the company as the leader in the nascent business of delivering audio and video over slow dial-up Internet connections.\n\n\nspecial report\n\n\nRealNetworks"}

To sabotage or attack them at the beginning of an invasion would be rather easy, and some actually are Russian icebreakers.\u00a0\nThe complicated hydrography (with the huge difference in salinity depending on depth and location) of the Baltic Sea poses quite a challenge for MCM and ASW specialists; the Germans and Danes are experienced in this area, British, French, Spanish, Italian and American personnel not so much.\nNow about problems caused by ice cover in addition to navigation:\nASW ships could also suffer from damage to bow sonars due to ice collisions and MCM ships often have a wooden hull surface that would not be suitable for passing even through cleared lanes, much less thin ice. Aircraft carriers could not freely turn into the wind to facilitate aircraft launches with full fuel and much payload. Accidents happen with inexperienced bridge crews who never before cooperated with icebreakers. Submarine operations are impeded under the ice; sub-launched missiles would not be available, periscope IFF would not be available, snorkeling would not be available and radio communications would be limited as well. On the other hand, sonobuoys could not be dropped, and helicopters' dipping sonars would be useless as well, so aerial ASW over ice is quite a dud in general.\nSome nuclear attack submarines would be prepared to break through the ice once in a while, but the generally rather shallow waters don't suit the large SSNs well and their crews rarely if ever trained in this area.\nI understand that naval-minded people like to think about uses for navies, but Baltic defence hardly is one. A deterrence against invasion needs to be effective all-year, and in worst case the defence (counterattack) needs to be successful all-year as well.\nLikewise, I suppose air power-minded people will think about air attack as relevant, but again I doubt it. A Baltic defence conflict scenario would need to escalate to include Belarus (which the Russians better keep neutral and use as radar base and secure supply route) and the Ukraine (imaginable that sometime in the rather distant future they might want to re-take territory from Russia) in order to enlarge the area enough to make air attack potentially decisive.\nA Baltics-only defence scenario could see a concentration of air defences that would take weeks to dismantle, if that succeeds at all. Russia could move several high-end air defence regiments from the Moscow area to Latvia by road within a week or so.\nThat's why I recently looked at the brigades (equivalents) count: I think the land forces and political decisions are all-important for Baltic deterrence and defence, with air and sea power being distant subordinates.\nS O"}
{"id": 729, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Naturalist in theory, Mercenary in practice! After accomplishing some of my own Herculean and Sisyphean labours (of which more later) and having reached middle age I put them down on paper but there were no takers because the publishers felt that what I had written wouldn't sell. However, unlike in times of yore, these days intellectual expressions spurned by print publishers can still find a readership on the Internet where most things and especially unsolicited information and advice can be offered for free. So here are the results of my labour. But before people can get to my writings proper a small warning as to what they are in for is in order. I believe neither in God nor in Utopia. I neither think that there is any human destiny nor that there is any pre-determined purpose in nature. I hold instead that everything depends on sheer chance and so life is, always has been and always will be unpredictable.\n\nA Cheerful Sceptic!\n\nThus for me if there is any sin it is that of trying to make life predictable by binding it into the tyrannical confines of religion, ideology and private property and using society and the environment as dustbins for the negative side effects of such sinning. It is this sin that is frequently visited on us in the form of covert and overt wars, mayhem and murder and environmental disasters. So, like all true blue naturalists and following in the footsteps of the first and greatest of them all, the Buddha, I too believe in nothing (It is of course a different matter that later the Buddha's followers unable to bear the scary thought of this nothingness transformed him into a God and Buddhism into a religion). Being a naturalist I am consequently also a sceptic because I am inherently suspicious of grand theories whether religious or secular. However, since I do not expect anything from life I am nevertheless a cheerful sceptic! A Bhil Family At the threshold of my adult life in 1983 I became an apostate from modern technology because of these heretic ideas. Instead of pursuing a career as a civil engineer and manager for which I had trained for five years before that at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, I chose to lead a life of social activism among the Bhil adivasis (tribals or indigenous people as some others prefer to call them) in Alirajpur district of Madhya Pradesh in India. I have often been castigated for supposedly wasting my education as an engineer. My answer has been that I have used my training to much better effect in cooperating with the Bhils to conserve nature through watershed development leading to climate change mitigation as in the picture below to the left.\n\nErosion Plugged\n\n\nInitially I still had some belief in Marxism and Gandhism despite some of their utopian and deterministic aspects. However ten beautiful years spent among the supremely anarchist Bhils made me shed these shackles of my mental bondage. The Bhils have traditionally lived non-accumulative, minimalist lives close to nature and have fought fiercely to maintain its pristine glory and their subsistence lifestyles and a typical Bhil family is pictured above. They held their own right up to the end of the first millenium after Christ. Their monuments to their martyrs called \"Gathas\" and shown in the picture below to the right testify to this rich and colourful martial history.\n\n\nMemorial to Bhil Martyrs However, their bows and arrows were no match for the firearms that their adversaries began to use against them with the advent of the second millennium after Christ and since then they have been continually dispossessed of their habitats and pushed back into remoter and remoter corners till after independence no remote corners remained to be penetrated by the modernising Indian state. Thus, the initial matter of concern for me when I arrived in Alirajpur was the absolute mismatch of traditional Bhil culture and lifestyle with the prevailing modern scenario and their consequent devastation. Education, meaning the learning of the complicated aspects of the modern world and being able to synthesize these with their own rich culture was a must if the Bhils were to survive as equal human beings in a competitive democracy. This has been the goal of the modern political struggles of the Bhils. An educated Bhil painter and activist, Gosa, portrays this in the picture along side, which has pens as arrows.\n\nHowever, later I came to realise, with the prodding of my wife Subhadra who is a firebrand feminist and to whom I got married in 1993, that there is a major flaw in this picture of Gosa's. Subhadra is a dalit (translates as repressed), who are the previously untouchable outcastes of traditional Indian society. Pens as Arrows\n\nSubhadra belongs to the Mahar caste from which Babasaheb Ambedkar the great campaigner for dalit liberation hailed. She has fought her own battles against patriarchal and caste oppression including that resulting from her marriage to an upper caste"}
{"id": 730, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "The dark web has started to embrace Monero, a privacy-conscious alternative to Bitcoin.\n\nFirst, the operators of SIGAINT, a commonly used dark web email provider, decided to host a full node for Monero light wallets. Then, an eight-month-old darknet market called Oasis decided to allow vendors to accept Monero. Finally, Alphabay, the largest darknet market in operation right now, announced the first phase of Monero implementation on their platform.\n\nWhy Monero?\n\nStaff members at Alphabay and Oasis say that customers and vendors have simply demanded the Monero option. \"It's a lot more secure than Bitcoin, especially when it comes to obfuscation,\" said an anonymous member of the Alphabay support staff.\n\nAlthough the darknet marketplaces tend to get negative press, the reality is that many of them bend over backwards for their customers; at least until they (some of them) exit scam. \"We have received a lot of requests about it; we've studied the cryptocurrency, and we've decided to implement it,\" said an Oasis staff member. \"This is what we do when users (both customers and vendors) suggest that we implement or change features. We love to hear back from everyone.\"\n\nThe hidden service set up by the operators of SIGAINT acts in a manner similar to Electrum for those who are familiar with that particular Bitcoin wallet. The hidden service allows individuals to use lightweight Monero clients as opposed to running a full node on their own. When visiting the hidden service via the Tor Browser, information about Monero is shown, including the following message:\n\n\"The SIGAINT operators firmly believe that Monero is the next logical step in Darknet commerce. It solves most of the privacy problems that plague cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin.\"\n\nBitsquare and ShapeShift.io appear to be the two options for obtaining Monero via Tor at the moment.\n\nWhy Not Dash or Zcash?\n\nIn addition to their reasons for supporting Monero, the SIGAINT operators have reasons not to prefer other options, such as Dash or Zcash. In the case of Dash, the site operators are wary of possible collusion by that digital currency's supernodes. With Zcash, the operators are concerned about the company's registration in the United States, the fact that mixing is done on an opt-in basis and the possibility of secret inflation initiated by the maintainers of the system.\n\nThe site operators also claim CoinJoin is not enough to maintain transaction unlinkability in Bitcoin. In a Reddit comment, Bitcoin Core contributor Luke-Jr seemed sympathetic to this viewpoint. \"Only a fool would use Bitcoin as it is today for darknet,\" he stated.\n\nThe staff members of Alphabay and Oasis seemed less inclined to talk about other privacy-centric digital currencies. \"Haven't read about [them] yet,\" said an Alphabay staff member when asked about Dash and Zcash.\n\nOne staff member from Oasis, which runs on donations, made it clear that they're mainly interested in keeping their customers happy:\n\n\"Users requested the Monero implementation; we wouldn't have done anything without their request. There are tons of other cryptocurrencies out there and we obviously cannot implement them all. We will always be based first on our users' feedback.\"\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin's main value proposition is as a fungible, bearer ecash that cannot be censored or tracked, but it's unclear whether Monero will be able to chip away at the leading digital currency's nearly $10 billion market cap. The price of Monero roughly doubled in the aftermath of these darknet announcements before coming back down to the 0.007 BTC area.\n\nAlthough staff members from Alphabay and Oasis did not seem philosophically married to Bitcoin in their comments to Bitcoin Magazine, Monero faces many challenges on the road toward more widespread adoption on the dark web or as a store of value. Even Riccardo Spagni, a well-known Monero developer, does not tell people they should buy Monero. Instead, he views it as a place of experimentation for features that cannot currently be tested on Bitcoin. It's possible that this sort of testing will take place on Bitcoin sidechains in the near future.\n\nEven in a scenario where Monero gains traction on the dark web, it's unclear if that would be enough for it to become a preferred store of value. Bitcoin still has a much longer track record and a much more liquid market, so it's possible that darknet market customers and vendors will use Monero as an appcoin more than anything else, even if moving in and out of the Monero system would harm their privacy.\n\nThe push toward Monero on the dark web is a development worth watching, but it's not the first time a darknet market has accepted an alternative, privacy-conscious digital currency"}

{"id": 732, "ended": true, "length": 718, "text": "I am convinced that over the past two years I've experienced what can only be characterized as illegal harassment and discrimination by various members of the administration of Rutgers University. This illegal harassment and discrimination is a result of Rutgers not complying with mandated State and Federal laws regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) related to my personal medical issues.\n\nSpecifically, I have been diagnosed with PTSD, panic disorder, and ADHD among others. I have been desperately trying to obtain help from multiple deans and advisory staff members at the University since my first semester there in the Fall of 2012. Every time that I have presented my personal situation to the administration over the past three years I have been told there is nothing that they can do, and that I would have to drop out. According to them, if they gave me help they'd have to \"give every student who came in after failing their class a free pass\". I was told all of this even after I had presented documentation from my physicians and others substantiating my chronic psychiatric illnesses and disabilities. At one point in my dealings with one of the University Deans I candidly disclosed my various diagnoses, and how my illnesses severely affect my ability to study, execute assignments, take tests, etc. The Dean callously and unsympathetically told me that I \"should have been a man, and did what I needed to do\" complete my classes.\n\nSuffering from the severe symptoms of multiple psychiatric disorders while trying to \"negotiate\" with a University staff that is uneducated regarding section 504 of the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) has proven to be one of the most difficult things I've ever done. To date, I have not received the proper scholastic assistance and accommodations to which Rutgers is legally obligated to provide me according to the ADA. Compounding my difficulties is the fact that I want to move on and complete my education even if it is not at Rutgers University, however, I am unable to do so because Rutgers has placed a financial hold on all of my transcripts. This financial hold is the result of an outstanding unpaid bill for a class that I was unable to attend due to my illnesses.\n\nIt is an unfortunate fact that someone experiencing the symptoms that are typical with certain types of psychiatric illnesses can easily be swept aside, and told to \"man up\" by those who are unfamiliar with these illnesses. Not every person with psychological illnesses looks sick, but we are. Thus, the intent of this petition is to garner attention and support for myself and the untold numbers of other students in similar situations. There are many of us that desperately need your help. By signing this petition and showing your support you will let the Rutgers University administration, as well as, Federal and State lawmakers know that students with these disabilities and challenges are not alone or invisible, and we are not voiceless. Together we will demand that all staff in administrative and guidance positions at every level of education be trained correctly to give proper and legal advice to students who come to them regarding psychiatric matters related to the ADA.\n\nAlso, with your signing of this petition I am hoping that it will help me to attain my own personal goals. Namely, I am demanding that Rutgers University: 1) purge my transcripts of all the classes in which I performed poorly due to my illnesses, 2) expunge the outstanding balance for the class I was unable to attend due to my illnesses, and 3) release the financial hold of my transcripts. I am demanding these resolutions due to the unjustified and illegal lack of assistance."}

It smacks of medieval sorcery. No one ever tells me how these animals change, just that they did. Magically. Although I love myths, magic and science fiction \u2014 for entertainment \u2014 I don't want to base my life on such things.\n\n\u2026 says the man who needs no explanation for Jesus' miracles or a virgin birth.\n\nHis logic is amazing. He's telling the world, \"I don't get it, so there's no way it could have happened!\"\n\nHe's not done yet, either:\n\nThe problem is that what we know about science \u2014 the laws devised from actually observing the universe \u2014 do not allow for the kind of evolutionary scenario that I mentioned above.\n\nWell. I guess that settles it then. The guy who own writing informs us of how little he knows about science says science itself disproves evolution.\n\nWait! There's more!\n\nThen there is this thing called entropy. You might have heard the word, but are not sure what it is. Entropy applies everywhere in the universe. The universe would not be the universe as we know it, were it not for entropy. In terms I can understand, entropy is this: \"Given time, all systems go from order to disorder.\" Actually, this is one of the few ways we can tell the direction of time's arrow. Time makes things worse. But according to evolution, over time, different life forms evolved and became more and more complex. It is almost as if evolution caused time to go backwards \u2014 but only for evolution. This sounds like a great fairy tale, but it makes for terrible science.\n\n\u2026 Says a man who has clearly never heard of Google\n\nSo why would any of us still believe in evolution when Pastor Anti-Darwin, Ph.D. has totally debunked the foundation of modern science?\n\nWell, he tells us why:\n\nSome people just follow the media and the academic elite because they think that those people must be very smart. But many of these very smart people cling to evolution because they want the approval of their peers, and they think that God would cramp their lifestyle.\n\nWe accept evolution because we just want people to like us. That's really the secret of the whole scientific method right there.\n\nI can appreciate one thing from Martens' piece: He makes it clear at the end that you can't possibly believe in both God and evolution. To deny evolution means accepting God. Since all of us immoral heathens want nothing to do with God, we cling to evolution, what with its \"facts\" and \"fossils\" and \"mountains of peer-reviewed evidence.\"\n\nThe comment section at the news site is just tearing Martens apart \u2014 and he totally deserves it. If only more pastors would follow in his footsteps and gleefully proclaim how out of touch with reality they really are.\n\n\u2026\n\n***Update***: Martens has responded to the criticism in the article's comment section and explains that he has a Ph.D. in Physics (?!?). On a bare-bones ZoomInfo page for him online, it unusually lists his education as \"PhD, Physics\" with no mention of where he earned his degree from. That's weird, right? (***Update***: His PhD apparently comes from the University of Manitoba.)\n\nMartens also says he has \"friends who are atheists, pagans, gays, Muslims\"\u2026 I suppose that's possible, but I still don't believe him. I want names. I want to talk to one of his atheist or gay friends. Just one. C'mon, Dr. Pastor Martens, give us a name!\n\n***Update 2***: Commenters are saying that the University of Manitoba Physics program is not accredited.\n\nThey *may* have also found his Ph.D. thesis.\n\n(Thanks to Brian for the link)"}

He recalls being surprised not to see any students in the institute's laboratories, where volt meters and scientific equipment remained in their original packaging.\n\nThough Kauffman spied students elsewhere, he said he could never get a reliable account of how many were actually enrolled at the school. He also could not verify that the institute had addressed what a 2011 external audit called a host of \"deviations\" from sound practices, including a lack of accounting software, a cash-based payment system, and $118,000 in spending by the school over a five month period on weapons, international travel, and salary supplements.\n\nKauffman didn't have the authority to demand a new, broader audit of the institute, but he reported his concerns to his superiors at USAID. They never acted, he said, and he recalls an official in the agency's Office of Afghanistan-Pakistan Affairs expressing worry that canceling the institute's funding would create what the official called \"bad press.\"\n\n\"Every time something came up, they jumped to keep this guy [the institute's leader] happy, despite the problems, despite the lack of financial transparency,\" said Kauffman, who is now a private development consultant based in the San Francisco Bay Area. In fact, USAID continued giving the institute funds, totaling at least $12.3 million through last Sunday, according to USAID spokesman Sam Ostrander.\n\nKauffman's experience is only a small part of the controversy suddenly surrounding the long-running U.S. effort to promote the education and training of the largely illiterate population in Afghanistan. More than three-quarters of a billion dollars in U.S. funds have been used to finance the effort, and USAID has repeatedly depicted it as one of its signal accomplishments there.\n\nLast month, Afghanistan's newly-appointed education minister raised questions about the veracity of that claim when he told his country's parliament that some aid funds had flowed to so-called \"ghost schools, which are only on paper,\" according to several Afghan media accounts of the May 27 session. The minister, Assadullah Hanif Balkhi, said that officials in the previous government \u2014 in power from 2004 to 2014 \u2014 lied about the number of schools to obtain more foreign funds.\n\n\"It is a fact that there are no schools in some parts of the country, but all the expenses \u2014 including teachers' salaries \u2014 are being paid, and now we will bring reforms to this waste,\" Balkhi told the parliament, according to Tolonews, a publisher and broadcaster based in Kabul.\n\nAsked to provide more detail, a spokesman for the ministry, Kabir Haqmal, later told NBC News \u2014 the Center for Public Integrity's publication partner for this article \u2014 that the matter is still under investigation. In some cases, he said, schools may have been closed due to fighting while \"permanent absentees\" were kept on the books for years, following a requirement of Afghan law.\n\n\"There could be schools that do not exist, but we [are] assessing all our records and so far have not found any such instances,\" Haqmal said. \"That does not mean there are no ghost schools, but we just do not have that information yet. We are taking this very seriously and will share our finding with public very soon.\"\n\nThe new minister's claims have provoked the top federal auditor for U.S. reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, John F. Sopko, to express concern that \"U.S. and other donors may have paid for schools that students do not attend and for the salaries of teachers who do not teach.\"\n\nIn a June 11 letter to acting USAID administrator Alfonso E. Lenhardt, released by Sopko on June 18, Sopko said the allegations about \"ghost schools, ghost students, and ghost teachers call for immediate attention,\" and asked the agency to explain within two weeks what it is doing to investigate the reliability of its data and the potential misuse of its funds.\n\nAccurate data, Sopko said, \"is essential for gauging progress in USAID's education programs and for making future funding decisions.\"\n\nUSAID spokesman Ostrander, in an emailed response to questions, said the agency will provide a detailed reply to Sopko by the June 30 deadline. According to a written statement Ostrander provided to the Center for Public Integrity from Larry Sampler, assistant to the USAID administrator for Afghanistan and Pakistan, the agency has already asked the Afghan Education Ministry for more information. USAID currently has a full-time employee assigned to help the ministry improve the reliability of its data, according to Sampler's statement.\n\nLike all the agency's projects in Afghanistan, \"USAID-implemented education"}

The top tax rate for individuals would be lowered from 39.6 per cent to 37 per cent.\n\nThe legislation repeals an important part of the 2010 health care law known as Obamacare \u2014 the requirement that all Americans carry health insurance or face a penalty \u2014 as the GOP looks to unravel the law it failed to repeal and replace this past summer.\n\nIt also allows oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n'Real tax relief', or 'messing up America'?\n\nDespite Republican talk of spending discipline, the bill will push the huge national debt ever higher.\n\n\"This was a promise made.

Mothers had a higher body-mass index and didn't eat as healthily as childless women, chugging more sugary drinks and eating more total calories and saturated fat. (More on Time.com: Babies Who Start Solids Too Early More Likely To Be Obese)\n\nBoth moms and dads exercised less than their child-free counterparts, but in a completely unfair twist, fathers' BMI didn't differ from that of men without children.\n\nParents are more apt to not take good care of their health at a time when they really need to be modeling healthy behavior for their miniature doppelgangers. That, of course, is easier said than done. The pressures of parenting are relentless, and sometimes it's easier to stick a frozen pizza in the microwave than fuss with coaxing kids to whole grains and leafy greens.\n\n\"All parents can relate to the idea of demands and trade-offs,\" says Jerica Berge, lead researcher and an assistant professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the University of Minnesota. She's also the mother of a 2-year-old and 6-year-old. \"We've all felt that we want to cook a healthy meal, but we've got to get out of here to make that appointment. We all relate to that feeling of not being able to pay attention to your health because of parenting demands.\" (More on Time.com: Did Your Doctor Call You Fat? You Should Thank Her For It)\n\nIn the study, published online Monday in the journal Pediatrics, moms got less exercise per week, 4.5 hours of physical activity compared with the 6 hours that non-mothers got. The American Heart Association recommends 30 minutes of exercise per day most days of the week.\n\nMothers also ate more calories, 2,360 compared with childless women's 1,992. \"The difference between those is significant,\" says Berge. The research didn't focus on what the difference might be attributed to, but Berge didn't disagree when this reporter suggested those 368 calories could easily result from grazing on children's leftovers.\n\nResearchers found that mothers and non-mothers ate similar quantities of nutritious foods \u2014 whole grains, fruits, vegetables \u2014 but moms also ate more unhealthy foods. \"We think moms, though trying to model by eating fruits and vegetables, might be having a conflict with time demands so instead of opting to cook a healthy meal, they're making chicken nuggets and macaroni and cheese,\" says Berge. \"They're probably eating them with their kids too, so they are eating high-fat foods at the same time they're eating healthy foods, and it kind of undoes the healthy foods.\" (More on Time.com: Toddlers' Junk-Food Diet May Lead to Lower IQ)\n\nFrom a public-health perspective, Berge says it's critical to intervene so that the behavior is not perpetuated from generation to generation.\n\nPediatricians, for example, address a child's dietary intake at well-child visits; that might be a good time to ask about the family's eating habits, too. If everyone's dining daily on pizza and corn dogs, the pediatrician might offer a gentle reality check.\n\nIf time is the problem, involve the kids, coercing them to set the table and getting them involved in the prep work. Figure out how to serve healthy foods quickly; putting baby carrots and dip on a plate takes no more time than setting out chips.\n\nWhat constitutes physical activity may also need some rethinking. It doesn't just have to be working the elliptical at the gym. Moms, don't sit on the bench at the park; kick a ball around with your kids. Choose stairs over elevators. Walk to school. \"Incorporate physical activity into time with your kids because it's probably not going to happen on its own,\" says Berge."}

These include a mix of water fountains, classroom and bathroom faucets, kitchen kettles and other fixtures. The testing covered slightly fewer than half the public schools in the state.\n\nThe report found that 72 percent of the schools, or 588 schools, had one or more fixtures exceeding recommended levels for lead or copper, most of them for lead. Of all the samples, 9 percent, or around 5,000 samples, exceeded recommended levels.\n\nKitchen kettles and classroom faucets were most likely to have high levels of lead or copper. Suuberg said some of these were fixtures that are rarely used so there was standing water. Others were used more frequently.\n\nThe schools did not receive state money to fix the problems, but Suuberg said in many cases, the schools were able to make fixes within their current budgets. For example, they turned off fixtures, flushed them out or replaced them. Grants and loans are sometimes available from water suppliers and other state programs if larger plumbing projects are required, such as replacing pipes.\n\nThe program's budget was $2.1 million, and it has $600,000 left. Environmental officials hope to use that money to continue the testing program at additional schools through the end of the year.\n\n\"We think the idea of detecting it and dealing with it is the right thing to do,\" Suuberg said.\n\nThe school-by-school results of the tests and the full report follow:\n\nLcca Schools List by The Republican/MassLive.com on Scribd\n\nleadinschoolsprogramfinalreport-522017 by The Republican/MassLive.com on Scribd"}

It was just too expensive.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, tech startups typically build their businesses with help from cloud computing services \u2013 services that provide instant access to computing power via the internet \u2013 and Frenkiel's startup, a San Francisco outfit called MemSQL, was no exception. It rented computing power from the granddaddy of cloud computing, Amazon.com.\n\nBut in May, about two years after MemSQL was founded, Frenkiel and company came down from the Amazon cloud, moving most of their operation onto a fleet of good old fashioned computers they could actually put their hands on. They had reached the point where physical machines were cheaper \u2013 much, much cheaper \u2013 than the virtual machines available from Amazon. \"I'm not a big believer in the public cloud,\" Frenkiel says. \"It's just not effective in the long run.\"\n\n>'I'm not a big believer in the public cloud. It's just not effective in the long run.' Eric Frenkiel\n\nFrenkiel's story shows that while cloud computing is suited to many tasks \u2013 including getting your startup off the ground or running a modest website \u2013 it doesn't make sense for others. When Zynga's online gaming empire expanded to epic sizes in 2012, the company made headlines in shifting much of its operation off the Amazon cloud and into its own data centers, but smaller operations are making the move too.\n\nLike MemSQL, the ride-sharing startup Uber recently moved most of its tech off the Amazon cloud, according to the company that now houses its physical servers, Peak Hosting. And various others, from analytics outfit Mixpanel to online clothes-trading startup Tradesy, have disclosed similar shifts.\n\n\"I don't know how much this is written about,\" says Kit Colbert, an engineer at VMware, whose software is used by cloud services as well as in private data centers. \"Within IT departments, public clouds do tend to get more expensive over time, especially when you reach a certain scale.\"\n\nThree years ago, Frenkiel and MemSQL tapped Amazon Web Services, or AWS, for the computing power they needed to build and test the software product at the heart of the company, a kind of new-age database. Renting virtual servers from Amazon was more convenient than buying a fleet of physical machines, and the prices seemed reasonable \u2013 not to mention the $10,000 in Amazon credits that MemSQL received through its seed funder, Y Combinator. \"When you're lean and just getting started,\" Frenkiel says, \"it's obviously the way to go.\"\n\nBut then, early this year, his Amazon bill started to rise.\n\nAnders Papitto, an engineer at San Francisco startup MemSQL. Once, he used Amazon servers to build and test software in the cloud. But now, like every other engineer at MemSQL, he uses the company's private fleet of computer servers.\n\nMemSQL's database product runs across tens and even hundreds of servers, and as the company started testing the software on an ever larger number of Amazon virtual machines, Frenkiel and company realized the cloud no longer made sense \u2013 at least not for the task at hand.\n\nThis past April, MemSQL spent more than $27,000 on Amazon virtual servers. That's $324,000 a year. But for just $120,000, the company could buy all the physical servers it needed for the job \u2013 and those servers would last for a good three years. The company will add more machines over that time, as testing needs continue to grow, but its server costs won't come anywhere close to the fees it was paying Amazon.\n\nFrenkiel estimates that, had the company stuck with Amazon, it would have spent about $900,000 over the next three years. But with physical servers, the cost will be closer to $200,000. \"The hardware will pay for itself in about four months,\" he says.\n\nOne of the perks of the Amazon cloud is that you can instantly expand and shrink your pool of machines, paying only for what you need at any given time. That's a great thing if you're building a new company \u2013 or running a website where traffic ebbs and flows. But MemSQL reached the point where its workload was relatively constant, where it was using pretty much the same number of virtual servers around the clock.\n\n\"The public cloud is phenomenal if you really need its elasticity,\" Frenkiel says. \"But if you don't \u2013 if you do a consistent amount of workload \u2013 it's far, far better to go in-house.\"\n\nJohn Hall, the chief technology officer and technical co-founder at the Santa Monica, California-based Tradesy, recently came to a similar realization. \"We've got only seven servers, and we've got a tremendous amount of computing power for the price,\" Hall says. \"Versus"}

Of the 27 million people that Obamacare left behind, about half of them don't buy insurance because it is too expensive.\n\nSo any debate to repeal and replace Obamacare must acknowledge the failures of Obamacare and try to insure more people at a lower price.\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion of Obamacare, Medicaid and other aspects of our varied and largely broken healthcare system over recent months \u2013 and a lot of bad information. But mostly, there have just been a lot of ideas that don't address the core problem of access and price of insurance.\n\nAs most of you know, I am not a career politician, and I don't think like one, which makes it difficult sometimes in Washington.\n\nIn my over 20 years as a doctor, I've seen both the good and the bad aspects of healthcare. One of the main reasons I ran for the Senate was to combat the Obamacare takeover of our healthcare system.\n\nMore: Eliminate barriers to good health care | Kim Greene\n\nNow, make no mistake, healthcare was broken before Obamacare, but Obamacare accelerated the decline and increased prices at alarming rates.\n\nI am in favor of repeal and I've been fighting for it since I was elected. Obamacare cost too much, mandated too much, told the states what to do too much \u2013 and still left 27 million people uninsured.\n\nWe can and must do better.\n\nThere are many facets to healthcare reform, but today I want to address one that is not getting enough attention as part of a fix \u2013 Association Health Plans.\n\nCurrently, under the law, certain types of employer groups may band together to offer insurance to their members and employees, thus allowing them to have a larger group and more leverage to get protections against pre-existing conditions and high prices.\n\nBut the current association rules are strict and the hoops that people have to jump through to join them and comply with regulations are still too steep. Additionally, not enough groups and individuals are even eligible to form or join these plans.\n\nOn Thursday in Kentucky, I will have a discussion with members of many groups who could become leaders in offering group insurance to their members, and to individuals.\n\nFrom the chambers of commerce to credit unions, the farm bureaus to fast food franchisees, there are millions of Kentuckians who could be eligible to join such groups if we change the laws and regulations as part of the Obamacare repeal debate.\n\nMore: McConnell touches on health care bill, protesters rally in Elizabethtown\n\nMy goal is that no one has to go at it alone. A husband and wife's plumbing business should not have to buy insurance as a pool of two, dreading that one of them may get cancer. Association plans would let plumbers, carpenters, welders or any type of small business band together to get group health insurance.\n\nThe biggest problem in health insurance is if you are on your own or part of a very small group, you have no leverage for prices, and if someone gets very sick, then you don't have the protection of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people sharing the risk.\n\nThat's what association health plans do. They let individuals join an association that then buys health insurance as a group. Not just those I mentioned above or those I'm meeting with in Louisville. Literally any group - your church, the NRA, the ACLU. Any group of people who choose to do so could offer cheaper, better health insurance.\n\nRight now, the insurance companies don't treat people in the individual or small group market like valued customers whose business must be won. Why? They don't have to.\n\nI want to turn the tables on this out of control big business. I want the consumer to be king. I want the insurance companies to come on bended knee to these large groups, forced to negotiate.\n\nThis can happen. The credit unions in Kentucky have over 800,000 members. The groups who appeared with me have over a million. But really, this is not limited, at all.

{"id": 750, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Last year, lobbying organizations spent a total of $3.2 billion to influence the U.S. Congress, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The effects of this lobbying are widely understood: Both Democrats and Republicans concur that these interest groups exercise too much power over our nation's government, and many believe that their influence has corrupted our nation's institutions. Unfortunately, events this year have shown that outside interest groups are beginning to shape our own student government in a similarly troublesome fashion.\n\nThis year, Undergraduate Students Association councilmembers Sunny Singh and Lauren Rogers received significant monetary gifts in the form of free trips to Israel paid for by the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee, respectively. Although these groups have wide-ranging agendas, both have openly campaigned against divestment from corporations that profit from Israeli violations of Palestinian human rights. These efforts include providing \"complimentary\" trips that integrate programming tailored to their anti-divestment positions.\n\nTo determine whether these trips constitute a conflict of interest, we can refer to the USAC bylaws. To quote the text itself: \"No Association member, elected or appointed, shall directly or indirectly receive improper benefits, as defined below, as a result of his or her position \u2026 (and) have an unauthorized financial interest or obligation which might cause divided loyalty or even the appearance of divided loyalty.\"\n\nThis definition highlights two key issues: the receipt of benefits as a result of one's position and the creation of conflicting loyalties to the student body and to the provider of the benefits.\n\nRegarding the first part of this definition, the ADL and the AJC offered trips to these students precisely because of their positions as elected representatives with political decision-making power; Singh took part in the ADL's \"Campus Leaders Mission to Israel\" and Rogers took a trip targeted to \"California student leaders.\" Both trips occurred after the students were elected to their leadership positions.\n\nRegarding the second part of the definition, Singh and Rogers received free international flights, meals and hotel stays, all potentially worth thousands of dollars. One can expect that after having been given these costly gifts, the councilmembers may have felt obligated to return the favor, perhaps by voting in agreement with the ADL and AJC's staunch anti-divestment stance.\n\nIn Singh's case, the ADL openly stipulated its post-trip expectations, writing that participants were expected to apply what they learned on the trip through their various student leadership positions and that the ADL would provide them assistance in doing so upon their return to campus. By accepting these trips and voting on divestment, Singh and Rogers entered a situation in which their obligation to represent students conflicted with their obligation to the groups that provided them such lavish benefits.\n\nThese issues are crucial for reasons that extend beyond the question of divestment. First, we must consider that if off-campus groups can influence the treatment of divestment resolutions, then there is every reason to anticipate that other groups with interests in campus decisions will line up to offer councilmembers their own free trips and gifts. In fact, there is already evidence that this is occurring; recently, the American Petroleum Institute has started to lobby universities against implementing resolutions calling for divestment from the fossil fuel industry.\n\nSecond, by ignoring the influence of political lobbies on UCLA's student governing bodies, we risk allowing them to recreate the same problems we see on a national level. Recently, councilmember Avi Oved's participation in the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference sparked protest from many campus communities who are offended by AIPAC's positions. Although student participation in these conferences is not problematic in itself, involvement by councilmembers suggests USAC's own endorsement of AIPAC's political positions and allows AIPAC to advance its systematic efforts to change student government decisions.\n\nAfter UC Berkeley's divestment resolution passed the student government in 2010, AIPAC Leadership Development Director Jonathan Kessler clarified this organizational strategy to an audience of college students: \"We're going to make sure that pro-Israel students take over the student government and reverse the (divestment resolution) vote,\" he said. \"This is how AIPAC operates in our nation's capital. This is how AIPAC must operate on our nation's campuses.\"\n\nUnless credible efforts are taken to curb the influence of outside interest groups on student government, we know exactly where we are headed. Our Congress' approval rating stands near a historic low, and the perception that special interest groups have more influence than average citizens is one of the main reasons why. Because outside organizations are now soliciting members of UCLA's governing bodies, Students for Justice in Palestine has asked the Judicial Board to review these conflicts of interest and offer clear guidance on these matters. We also hope that USAC updates its bylaws to prevent non-student organizations from exercising undue influence on student decisions.\n\nRiazi is a member of Students for Justice in Palestine and a fourth-year comparative literature and economics student.

Carhart has been featured in pro-abortion literature and film and appeared on television \u2014 or at least he used to make those appearances, until a woman died after one of his abortions earlier this year. Live Action sent two undercover reporters into Carhart's clinic. Both were told that the baby would be killed within the womb and left there for two or three days, which would make the baby like \"meat in a crock pot.\"\n\nFrom the detailed Live Action report on their Carhart investigation:\n\nHe casually described the abortion as a \"shot into the fetus\" to ensure that \"[i]t'll be dead for two days before you deliver it.\" He told her the injection also causes the baby to \"[get] soft, like mushy [makes squishing sound], so you push it through\u2026 so it's like putting meat in a crock pot.\" If this method is unsuccessful, he would have to remove the baby \"in pieces,\" using, he joked, \"a pickaxe, a drill bit.\" Both investigators asked if Carhart's abortions \"hurt\" the babies. He replied by arbitrarily inventing his own parameters for when a fetus feels pain. \"so, after about two to three weeks after birth\u2026 I think then they have pretty good knowledge of pain, but before that I'm not so sure that they do.\" In fact, there is wide consensus in the scientific community that babies feel acute pain by 20 weeks of gestation.\n\nCarhart wasn't exactly honest about the risk of his procedure, either:\n\nFinally, Carhart blatantly lied to both our investigators about the danger of his abortions, coercing his patients into a risky procedure. \"I've never had to send anybody to the hospital.\" Less than a year before, his staff were forced to call 911 after he injured a woman in an abortion. Our second investigator asked Carhart if she should call an ambulance if she goes into labor in her hotel room.

Or you could suggest that he was helped by those who knew he was the son-in-law of India's most powerful politician. But whichever way to you want to see Robert Vadra, there is little doubt that he made, and is still making, his biggest killing in the deserts of Rajasthan, a state run by a Congress government under Ashok Gehlot.\n\nParts of this story have already been told in the media, including Firstpost. What we now bring you is the real scale of Vadra's land holdings, and the humongous profit potential embedded in owning over 10,000 acres of land acquired for a song from unwary farmers. While his mother-in-law is trying to ensure that farmers get more than market prices, Vadra's caper is about skimming the cream himself with inside knowledge.\n\nSixty percent of the state (208,110 sq km) is low-cost desert land. It is dead land with no water or habitation in sight. The cost is often as low as Rs 20,000 an acre at some places. You can't make a killing unless you know someone would want to buy land at significantly a higher price than this.\n\nIn this desert state, Vadra picked up piece by piece of wasteland that was strategically located near power sub-stations in Bikaner and elsewhere. And from the few examples at hand, he is raking it in. A plot of 30 hectares costing Rs 4.45 lakh bought two years ago now fetches nearly Rs 2 crore!\n\nNot only that, but in some places he is practically a monopoly seller of the land. In Kolayat, for example, Vadra calls the shots. His companies own nearly 90 percent of the wasteland there.\n\nThrough his agents and companies, he directly bought hundreds of acres of land from small and big farmers in areas with solar power potential. According to sources, Vadra owns over 10,000 acres of land in the state today.\n\nOnly the state government - and the central government - knew that land around power sub-stations would be valuable once they announced plans incentivise solar power generation. So, logically, the state should have bought land first.\n\nIt did, but it did something peculiar. The Congress government in Rajasthan acquired 50,000 hectares of land for solar plants, but bypassed the wasteland near power sub-stations during the acquisition process. Solar plants situated close to sub-stations are most economical since this means you have to invest less in grid lines to evacuate the power.\n\nDid Gehlot's government know that Vadra was going to buy, or did Vadra know in advance that the state government was going to announce it solar policy well in advance? Firstpost sent a mail to Vadra to get his version of things, but at the time of writing he had failed to respond.\n\nVadra started creating a land bank near power sub-stations from June 2009. Barely eight months later, in February 2010, the Central Government announced the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (NSM) Policy under which huge subsidies (nearly 40 percent) were offered for setting up grid-tied solar power plants.\n\nAlmost immediately, Vadra's land located near power sub-stations soared in value. The land bought by the state government had practically no takers because most of it was not close enough for easy grid connections. The government is now mulling developing solar parks on this land by setting up elaborate evacuation systems. It will spend a pretty penny in doing so, while Vadra is sitting on crores of profits - and potential profits.\n\nNot one of the 23 companies which obtained licences to set up grid-connected solar power plants under NSM opted for government land! This, despite the fact that the state government offered to lease out or allot the land at 10 percent of the market rate.\n\nNow, stuck with land that no one wants, Rajasthan Energy Minister Jitender Singh says his government will build huge solar parks on the 50,000 hectares by setting up the necessary infrastructure.\n\nFor hundreds of private developers who have registered for solar plants in Rajasthan, land near a power sub-station is the top choice. This means they don't have to bear the cost of putting up gridlines and related infrastructure to connect to transmission sub-stations. Not only that, by setting up solar projects next to sub-stations, the investor suffers minimum loss in transmission and distribution of power.\n\nThe state government's land policy helped Vadra make crores because its own land policy involves only leasing the land, not selling it.\n\n\"This makes things more uncertain for a developer, because the government keeps changing and so does the solar policy,'' a private developer requesting anonymity said.\n\nFor instance, on 24 February 2009, the Rajasthan government had issued"}

Here's an indicator of how seriously members took that role in the past: Back in February 2010, final debate on extending the Patriot Act provisions took about 20 seconds on the Senate floor.\n\nAnd, at the time, the Senate didn't even bother to announce that it was extending key provisions of the law.\n\nThere were few reporters in the Senate's press galleries when that happened, and the odds are slim to none that anyone watching on C-SPAN 2 from outside the Capitol would figure out what the Senate had just passed by voice vote. In fact, the Senate inserted the Patriot Act extension into a substitute amendment to an unrelated House bill \u2014 an extension of higher payment rates to doctors treating Medicare patients, known as the \"doc fix.\"\n\nPhysical copies of the amendment text surfaced that evening, setting off a scramble in newsrooms where people were paying attention. #WGDB would know, since both of us were there.\n\nMeredith Shiner covered the story for Politico, and I contributed coverage for CQ.com:\n\nThe three Patriot Act provisions were set to expire at the end of 2009. But neither House nor Senate Democratic leaders showed any appetite for tackling a substantive rewrite of the law last year. In December, Congress cleared a short-term reauthorization until Feb. 28 this year as part of the fiscal 2010 Defense appropriations bill (PL 111-118). One of the expiring provisions allows the government to seek orders from a special federal court for \"any tangible thing\" that it says is related to a terrorism investigation. Another allows the government to seek court orders for roving wiretaps on terrorism suspects who shift their modes of communication. The third provision allows the government to apply to the special court for surveillance orders involving suspected \"lone wolf\" terrorists who do not necessarily have ties to a larger organization. That authority was first enacted as part of a 2004 intelligence overhaul law (PL 108-458).\n\nA more robust debate took place in December 2012, when senators voted 73-23 to extend provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act for five more years. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., led an unsuccessful effort to amend the bill to require a report on the gathering of domestic communications such as phone calls and emails.\n\nAs a member of the Intelligence Committee, Wyden likely knew something about what the report would say, a point Intelligence Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., made on the floor at the time.\n\n\"The goal of this amendment is to make information public about a very effective intelligence collection program that is currently classified. All of the information has already been made available to the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary committees. It is available to all members,\" Feinstein said. \"All they have to do is read it.

She added: \"We do not wish to give children to single parents or divorced people. It is not a religious rule but a human rule. Children need both parents, male and female.\"\n\nPreviously, orphanages around the country were allowed to hand-pick parents and match them with children. But that process, officials said, operated with scant oversight and was plagued by corruption, trafficking, delays, favouritism and prejudice.\n\nThe government now requires orphanages to submit records of children to a central authority that maintains a database. Prospective parents are asked to register with the authority, where an automated system will match them with children.\n\nThat means children from any orphanage can potentially be matched with single parents anywhere in the country, something the nuns of Mother Teresa's order frown upon. At a meeting in Delhi, Maneka Gandhi, the Minister for Women and Child Development, said the Missionaries of Charity had refused to register children in their care with the central authority.\n\n\"They have cited ideological issues with our adoption guidelines related to giving a child up for adoption to single, unwed mothers,\" said Ms Gandhi. \"They do not want to come under a uniform secular agenda.\" She added that the government will try to persuade the order to work with the new system because it has \"valuable, good people\" and experience in adoption.\n\nThe order, however, said it will give up its license. In Delhi it has transferred six unadopted children to Holy Cross Social Services, a Catholic organisation.\n\n\"We want to bring everybody under a uniform, secular website. We don't want these different groups running their own parallel systems any more,\" an official in the ministry of women and child development said. The vacuum left by the order is being filled by other agencies.\n\n\"We are seeing a sudden rise in children coming to our adoption home,\" said Lorraine Campos, assistant director of Palna, one of the oldest adoption homes in the capital. \"It could be because the Missionaries of Charity is not accepting any more.\n\n\"We don't have a problem with single parents or divorced people; we have to accept that society is changing. But we carefully study the kind of job pressures of the applicant and we also ensure that they have a family support system that can step in to give care to the child.\"\n\nThe Indian system does not, however, allow adoption by gay prospective parents. \"We have not progressed to that extent yet,\" Ms Campos said. Adoption agencies say the new system has cut the waiting period from several months to a few weeks.\n\n\u00a9 The Washington Post"}

Five-Bullet-Point Executive Summary mozjpeg relies on three technologies (progressive JPEG encoding, jpgcrush, and trellis quantization) to reduce the size of JPEG images. Progressive JPEG is supported in libjpeg-turbo, but jpgcrush and trellis quantization are not.\n\nWhen compared to progressive JPEG alone, the addition of jpgcrush and trellis quantization improved the compression ratio by 4-15% (average 8.3%) in our testing but increased encoding time by approximately 4-7x. Decoding time was, however, reduced by anywhere from 2-62%.\n\nWhen compared to baseline (the only mode that is fully accelerated in libjpeg-turbo), the combination of progressive JPEG, jpgcrush, and trellis quantization improved the compression ratio by 15-27% (average 20%) in our testing but increased encoding time by approximately 34-59x. More than half of the compression ratio improvement came from the use of progressive JPEG, which is supported in libjpeg-turbo as well. Decoding time was increased by anywhere from 17% to 3x, with most of this again being due to the use of progressive JPEG.\n\nArithmetic coding (which is supported in libjpeg-turbo) generally produces similar compression ratios to the ones that mozjpeg is capable of producing, but arithmetic-coded images decode more slowly than the ones produced by mozjpeg (and arithmetic coding is not widely supported.)\n\nWhen compared to baseline, the combination of baseline and trellis quantization improved the compression ratio by 10-18% (average 13%) in our testing but increased encoding time by approximately 17-40x. Decoding time was, however, decreased by anywhere from 4-11%.\n\nTrellis quantization does not produce images that are \"mathematically equivalent\" to baseline or \"regular\" progressive JPEG images.\n\njpgcrush and trellis quantization currently break backward ABI compatibility, but a solution is in the works for that. In short, while we still have our doubts as to the overall usefulness of mozjpeg, we have upgraded our assessment of the technology from \"completely useless\" to \"possibly useful in some situations.\" However, the slow performance and narrow scope of usefulness still makes it a non-starter for merger with libjpeg-turbo. Background On March 5, 2014, Mozilla announced the mozjpeg project, a JPEG encoder that is designed to provide better compression for web images, at the expense of performance. Since mozjpeg builds upon the libjpeg-turbo source code, quite a few people have asked, \"why didn't Mozilla just integrate their changes into libjpeg-turbo?\" The words \"at the expense of performance\" provide the simplest answer to that question, but I felt that a more detailed review was in order. For starters, Mozilla did approach me regarding the possibility of integrating their code into libjpeg-turbo, but we both basically agreed that the project goals are incompatible. As the README file for mozjpeg says: 'mozjpeg' is not intended to be a general JPEG library replacement. It makes tradeoffs that are intended to benefit Web use cases and focuses solely on improving encoding. It is best used as part of a Web encoding workflow. For a general JPEG library (e.g. your system libjpeg), especially if you care about decoding, we recommend libjpeg-turbo. mozjpeg's sole purpose is to reduce the size of JPEG files that are served up on the web. Thus, Mozilla wants their solution to compress as tightly as possible out of the box. We, on the other hand, want our solution to compress as quickly as possible out of the box. There is really no way to reconcile those two goals. mozjpeg, which as of this writing is at version 2.1, relies on several methods to reduce the size of JPEG images: Progressive JPEG encoding\n\njpgcrush, which determines the progressive encoding configuration that will produce the best compression ratio\n\nTrellis quantization. This is basically a more intelligent algorithm for deciding what data to throw out during lossy compression. It should be noted that, unlike progressive encoding and jpgcrush, trellis quantization does not produce images that are mathematically equivalent to baseline JPEG images. Each of these methods provides an incremental improvement in compression ratio, but with an extreme loss of compression speed. Performance Probably the best way to illustrate the above statement is to put some numbers to it. The attached spreadsheet compares the performance of various compression modes in libjpeg v6b, libjpeg-turbo v1.3.x, and mozjpeg v2.1 using the same images and benchmarks that were used in the libj"}

For a long time now, I've known myself to be one of the latter. Just like Big Mac meals, a couple more beers, getting fit .. when the urge takes, buffets sound like a good idea but quickly turn into a thing of regret. I'm not the best person then to get the most out of an all-you-can-eat situation, the star of which is essentially bits of meat/fish/veg dipped in boiling hot grease. Still, it was fun to get hands on and do the dipping, coating, and deep fryin' at the table. I think I got through about 6-8 kushikatsu before I reached saturation point. It was around the 10 mark that I started to feel a bit nauseous!\n\nI think, compared with the real thing you might get down in Osaka, the pieces of meat/fish/veg here are so small that the percentage of grease consumed ends up being much larger. Also, it doesn't help to get carried away with salad bars, and pasta/noodle side dishes. Something, I fear, I will never learn.\n\nAs I said, the hands-on aspect is fun, but the end result is a table situation that looks like wild bears have raided a picnic (after the humans have left), covered in grease. Definitely not the scene for a romantic occasion.\n\nFun experience overall, and one that I would recommend to have a go at once. Long term though, this buffet is a heart attack waiting to happen!"}

It's got massive air inlets, a wider grille, additional lateral air intakes and outlets, tinted bezels for the optional Matrix LEDs and wider wheel arches.\n\nOther visual features include the RS-specific diffuser insert, oval tailpipes of the RS exhaust system and the surface-mounted spoiler lip. Then there's the standard 19\u2033 wheels, though buyers might consider going for the more imposing 20\u2033 optional alloys.\n\nPowering the all-new RS5 is a 2.9-liter TFSI V6 bi-turbo engine, which Audi built from the ground up. It produces 450 PS (331 kW) as well as 600 Nm (443 lb-ft) of torque, which is an increase of 170 Nm (125 lb-ft) compared to the previous generation model. In a straight line, it will go from zero to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.9 seconds and max out at 280 km/h (174 mph) with the optional dynamic package.\n\nAccording to Audi, this V6 unit consumes just 8.7 liters of fuel per 100 km (27 US mpg), while corresponding to 197 grams CO2 per km \u2013 a gain of 17% over the previous model in terms of efficiency. Another significant gain is related to weight, where the new RS5 Coupe tips the scales at 1,655 kg (3,648 lbs), approximately 60 kg (132 lbs) less than before \u2013 the optional carbon fiber roof helps too.\n\nAside from the fact it sits much lower compared to the production model, the RS5 Coupe also boasts a sports suspension with Dynamic Ride Control (DRC), ceramic brakes and dynamic steering with RS-specific tuning. Also, by using the standard Audi drive select system, drivers can make their personal driving experience more \"individual, dynamic or comfortable.\"\n\nMoving on to the interior, you'll find details such as RS sports seats with optional diamond stitching in Fine Nappa leather, a flat-bottomed RS multifunction sport steering wheel, RS logos on the seats, steering wheel, door sill trims and selector lever and special RS displays in the Audi virtual cockpit.\n\nAs for infotainment choices, there's the optional MMI navigation plus with MMI touch, Audi connect & LTE. Passengers can even go online with their mobile devices via the Wi-Fi hotspot option, and as you'd expect, there's Apple CarPlay and Android Auto availability. Other high-end technologies present in the new RS 5 Coupe include the head-up display and as many as 30 driver assistance systems.\n\nFollowing its debut at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show, Audi's all-new RS5 is set to hit dealerships in Germany and other European countries this June, priced from \u20ac80,900.\n\n*Updated with live pics from Geneva\n\nPHOTO GALLERY"}

My defense was good, but Adrian Peterson and Cam Newton tried their best to kill my team, and they did to the tune of a 2-11 record. Yes, beyond everything I am PISSED, but that cannot keep me from helping YOU in winning your league with defensive rankings. While \"start your studs\" is the rule of thumb during the season, the playoffs are a complete crapshoot, and defensive players are notorious for making/breaking playoff runs. These rankings are specifically geared towards the fantasy playoffs first week, accounting for player trends and NFL opposition. You may scratch your head or wash out your eyes at some of the names I recommend starting/sitting, But trends and likelihood of solid/great weeks versus duds are also accounted for as you seek another (perhaps first) fantasy football championship!\n\nDannell Ellerbe (WLB-N.O.)\u2013 Ellerbe is a half sack away from tying his career high in sacks, four and a half, and has only played in five games this season. The Saints defense can use all the help it can get this season, and Ellerbe has been an under valued linebacker since he joined the Saints defense after missing the first eight games due to a quad injury. Jameis Winston and the hot Bucs are a tall order, but Ellerbe is a strong start this week and in the playoffs.\n\nAnthony Barr (SLB-MIN)\u2013 Barr started the first half of the season at a snail's pace,. But he has shown signs of life of late, hinting at some of the playmaking ability he gave us all glimpses of last season. He is a risky play, but that risk is curbed by the fact that the opposition is the Jaguars offense that has virtually no run game. Bortles can get the ball down field in a hurry, but he can also be inaccurate and is prone to careless mistakes. It is worth the gamble this week if you have room to play Barr or are in a league that rewards tackles for loss or deflected passes.\n\nKwon Alexander (MLB-T.B.)\u2013 Sit Kwon Alexander this week. No, you don't need to get your momma to come slap me because this is a bad matchup for the Bucs' leading linebacker. If you look over the Bucs past five games in MLFS and most standard leagues, Alexander has struggled to post double digit fantasy points posting a mere 22 tackles one and a half stuffs, one sack and zero passes defensed. He got off to a blistering start, but is in a bit of a funk, and why risk starting him in the playoffs versus one of the least sack prone QBs in Drew Brees? No sense.\n\nVic Beasley(SLB-ATL)\u2013 Beasley is he second leading fantasy linebacker behind only Vontaze Burfict. He gets to tee off on the anemic Rams offense and Jared Goff as the Falcons look to keep their divisional lead over the Bucs. The Falcons secondary is suspect at best. But the Rams will keep it conservative with Goff and no run game. Beasley is going to be in for an insane week.\n\nDerrick Morgan (OLB-TEN)\u2013 Starting Morgan can be playing with fire until you realize that since October 9th, he has only two games in which he has not recorded a sack. The Broncos have played it conservatively with Siemian and rookie Lynch this season. But, the offensive line still has some major holes which opens up the possibilities for the Titans and Morgan. He is a solid, steady start this week as he should be a lock for a sack or at minimum a tackle for loss or two.\n\nRyan Shazier (ILB-PIT)\u2013 Although he has been quiet the past two weeks, Shazier is a must start this week as the Steelers take on the Bills. The Bills have allowed 34 sacks and present a limited pass offense, which could open the playbook for the Steelers front seven and Shazier. While the Bills are very run-heavy and possess dangerous weapons in Taylor and McCoy, if the run game is stumped, it will be Steel Curtain time for the Steelers defense. Shazier is a solid play this week as a sack is virtually certain for the Steelers' backer.\n\nJoey Bosa (DE-S.D.)\u2013 Like all rookies, Bosa has experienced ups and downs this season. Still, he is a must start this week for the Chargers as Cam Newton and the baffling Panthers are on tap. The Panthers offensive line is an embarrassment and Bosa is sure to make them pay.\n\nJerry Hughes (DE/OLB-BUF)\u2013 I hate telling owners to bench defensive ends in the playoffs, but you simply cannot trust Hughes as he has exactly one sack over the past five games and zero over their last three.

But tritium is an element that we know a lot about,\" Dale Klein, chairman of Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s Nuclear Reform Monitoring Committee, told a news conference in Tokyo.\n\n\"It can be released safely into the ocean. We know worldwide what the safe limit for tritium release is,\" said Klein, who once headed the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nTepco has been treating water stored at the plant with a system known as ALPS (Advanced Liquid Processing System), which removes all radioactive materials except for tritium.\n\nThe processing has left the utility with vast amounts of water contaminated with heavy doses of tritium. About 350,000 tons of the water is currently stored in hundreds of large tanks, each of which poses a potential leak risk.\n\nTepco has said the level of tritium in the water is between 1 million and 5 million becquerels per liter. The legal limit for release to the sea is 60,000 becquerels.\n\nTritium has a half life of 12.3 years, so it would take decades to die down to permitted levels if left undiluted. The element is about one-thousandth as radioactive as the isotopes cesium-134 and cesium-137, according to Tepco.\n\nTepco said it has not decided yet what to do with the tritium-tainted water, as a government panel is currently trying to figure out what options are available.\n\nKlein said he understands the option to release the water into the Pacific \"is intensely emotional\" among local fishermen, but he is confident that the they will eventually agree with his view.\n\nHe noted that fishermen in the past agreed to an equally controversial decision to discharge clean groundwater pumped up at the site before it seeps into the reactor buildings and becomes contaminated.\n\nMeanwhile, Tokyo Electric Power Co. said Monday it will release all available radiation data associated with the Fukushima No. 1 plant after facing criticism for failing to promptly announce leaks of radioactive rainwater into the sea.\n\nTepco said it had a policy of disclosing radiation information for contaminated water stored at the plant facilities if there is a risk of that water reaching the sea. This policy did not cover rainwater in drainage ditches, however radioactive it might be.\n\nThe utility has been criticized for not promptly releasing information about radioactive rainwater when it had data confirming leaks had taken place.\n\nInformation from Jiji added"}

The reality could be that now Abraham has re-signed the Falcons may not have the Salary Cap room to bring back Lofton.\n\nKelvin Hayden & James Sanders\u2013 Both of these defensive backs were picked up in free agency late last year and both played well and helped the team especially Sanders as Hayden had some injury problems and only appeared in 8 games. Hayden was due to meet with the Chicago Bears on Wednesday but to this point no agreement has been reached.\n\nEric Weems\u2013 The Falcons kick returner has signed a three year contract with the Bears. With so many Touchbacks in today's NFL the position of kick returner is not so important and the Falcons can easily give these duties to someone already on the roster like Douglas or Franks.\n\nTodd McClure\u2013 The Falcons veteran centre looks like he will have to find what would only be his second ever NFL team and the Rams are interested. The emergence of Joe Hawley last year has obviously played a part in this but McClure would bring some stability to an ever changing O-Line.\n\nThe Following players have all been re-signed:\n\nHarry Douglas, Chris Redman, Antone Smith, Jason Snelling, Michael Palmer, Vance Walker, Kroy Biermann & Thomas Decoud.\n\nThat leaves:\n\nMike Cox, Reggie Kelly, Kirk Chambers, Brett Romberg and Mike Peterson."}

After the FUD surrounding the patents have cleared with the release of React.js 16, Microsoft joins to use the popular React.js library in the email service Outlook.com - originally known as Hotmail before MSFT acquision.\n\nReact originates from Facebook, and the core contributors are currently all employed by the social media behemoth. React popularised the building of declarative UIs on the web and elsewhere (mobile, VR, etc\u2026) and is now popping up everywhere from start-ups to IT industry giants. The recent State of JavaScript 2017 survey shows React.js dominating the JavaScript scene in 2017, and is showing no signs of decline in 2018 and beyond.\n\nApple has embraced React some time ago on it's developer documentation site, and with the latest renewal Microsoft of Outlook.com joins the bandwagon. In the introductory post from August 2017 the company touts improvements in the technology space:\n\nRecent advances in programming, design, and artificial intelligence have enabled our engineers and designers to improve the Outlook.com web experience in several areas\u2014and we're eager to get your feedback.\n\n- Introducing the Outlook.com beta\n\nThe above is not a technical post per se, so it's no wonder that React was not specifically mentioned.

A quick look under the hood gives shows that the new inteface is running MS Office UI Fabric for React with the React version still being 15.6.2 - the MIT licensed version of the React 15 series.\n\nEarlier Microsoft has already recommended using React.js for SharePoint development. Outlook.com is one of the largest email services, with some 400 million active users. It's short of Gmail's 1 Billion+, but mind that Microsoft handing over a key web property's UI tech to React.js.\n\nThis move is another testament to how profoundly the original developers of React.js shaped the landscape of contemporary web development."}

Whether a default would amount to repudiation is an open question, but one that need not be answered at a time when tax revenues are sufficient to service current debt. Not only is the debt limit consistent with the Constitution's separation of powers, but there is a colorable argument that it, or something like it, is constitutionally mandated.\n\nLiberal legalists and pundits are abuzz with the idea that an obscure constitutional clause empowers the President to burst through the debt limit if Congress declines to raise it. While their focus on the constitutional text is welcome, their theory as to what it means would be merely laughable if some politicians had not begun to embrace it as a way out of a difficult negotiation.\n\nThe President has no more unilateral power to issue new debt on the credit of the United States than he has to collect taxes or make expenditures that have not been enacted by Congress. To claim such a power would be unprecedented, unconstitutional, and absurd. Moreover, the affront to the Congress's rightful prerogatives would be serious, even for those seeking to avoid the hard work of putting the federal budget in order.\n\nSection Four\n\nSection four of the Fourteenth Amendment provides, \"The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.\" It also declares \"illegal and void\" \"any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave.\"\n\nThis clause simply means that Congress and the President cannot question the validity of debt that is already incurred, but it in no way requires the nation to incur more debt. Even if it precludes temporary default\u2014which is far from clear\u2014it could not authorize the President to incur additional debt.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment was among those proposed and ratified during Reconstruction, and section four was its least-debated provision. During the Civil War, the Union had taken on massive debt to fund the war effort and had promised pensions to wounded soldiers and soldiers' widows and orphans. The Confederate states had done about the same. Members of the 39th Congress, which excluded representatives of the Confederate states, feared that a future Congress dominated by Southern Democrats would wipe out Union debt and possibly seek to have the federal government guarantee the Confederate debt\u2014an appalling possibility that would reward those who had financed an insurrection and risk political disruption for years to come.[1]\n\nTheir solution was to amend the Constitution to declare Confederate debt unenforceable while barring subsequent Congresses from \"question[ing]\" \"the public debt of the United States.\" This formulation was somewhat narrower than that of earlier proposals, which stated that federal \"obligations\"\u2014potentially a more expansive category than debts\u2014would be \"inviolable.\"[2] But it was also broader than the specific question at hand: the vitality of Civil War debts. This was deliberate. Senator Benjamin Wade, a proponent of the amendment, set forth the rationale:\n\nI believe that to do this will give great confidence to capitalists and will be of incalculable pecuniary benefit to the United States, for I have no doubt that every man who has property in the public funds will feel safer when he sees that the national debt is withdrawn from the power of a Congress to repudiate it and placed under the guardianship of the Constitution\u2026.[3]\n\nThe Supreme Court's sole opportunity to interpret and apply section four was in a 1935 case, Perry v. United States, which challenged Congress's attempt to pay off bonds subject to a gold clause in devalued legal tender. The Court stated:\n\nIn authorizing the Congress to borrow money, the Constitution empowers the Congress to fix the amount to be borrowed and the terms of payment. By virtue of the power to borrow money \"on the credit of the United States,\" the Congress is authorized to pledge that credit as an assurance of payment as stipulated, as the highest assurance the government can give, its plighted faith. To say that the Congress may withdraw or ignore that pledge is to assume that the Constitution contemplates a vain promise\u2026. This Court has given no sanction to such a conception of the obligations of our government.[4]\n\nThis principle, said the Court, \"applies [] to the government bonds in question, and to others duly authorized by the Congress.\"[5]\n\nConstitutionality of the Statutory Debt Limit\n\nArticle I of the Constitution vests the power in Congress \"to borrow money on the credit of the United States\" and the power \"to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United"}

After all, the industry's created several waves of innovation that's supporting this across multiple layers in the stack:\n\nOpen source software instead of paid developer tools\n\nAWS instead of your own datacenter\n\nPer-click ads instead of Superbowl commercials\n\nOff-the-shelf SaaS tools versus building your own\n\nApp stores for efficient global distribution\n\nNot only do a number of these trends make building new products cheap, in many cases it's about driving the costs down to zero. If we zoom just into AWS / cloud computing, you see how a massive amount of competition is leading to significantly lower costs \u2013 even some vendors giving away their services pro bono:\n\nAs cloud providers rush to build new data centres, and battle for market share, businesses are finding that the cost of putting their computing and data storage into the online cloud is getting ever cheaper. In the past three years prices are down by around a quarter, according to Citigroup, a bank; and further significant falls look all but inevitable. Some providers, such as Microsoft, have started providing their services free to startups, in the hope of turning them into paying customers as they grow. (Economist)\n\nHowever, this is opposite of what's happening. Instead, startups are raising more capital and burning more capital to get to their Series As. It might be cheap to build the v1 of your app, but getting traction is a whole other story. Compared to a decade ago, it's getting more expensive to get traction, while at the same time, growth is getting harder from intensive competition, consolidation, and saturation.\n\nWhy costs are rising\n\nThere are two underlying reasons for the increasing costs: Salary/comp for your team, and growth has shifted more towards paid acquisition. While the former is obvious (especially to those paying rent in San Francisco), the second is more nuanced, since it's driven by a number of industry trends.\n\nAs we've said, growth is getting harder, and as a result, companies building new products are evolving their strategies away from counting on traditional channels like virality, SEO, and organic, and more towards paid acquisition to scale. Even though traction is difficult to achieve in today's climate, venture capital is plentiful for those who hit a solid growth curve. This means that companies have an advantage when they execute well also have a natural product/channel match for paid acquisition channel. (Think high LTVs, lack of ad competition, being good at fundraising.)\n\nWhat's happening as a result\n\nAs a result of this pivot towards paid acquisition to scale, we see four trends that go along with rising costs:\n\nStartups are raising more money to get to traction Companies are trying paid marketing earlier There's an increase in emphasis on paid referral programs rather than virality Companies are going for deeper monetization in order to open up paid channels\n\nLet's look at each of these trends.\n\n1. Startups are raising more money to get to traction\n\nMore focus on paid acquisition means startups need to raise more money to raise money only once they can prove out their traction. We're seeing more companies raising more money to get more traction before they raise, and when they do take the new round, it's often to fund bigger and more expensive paid acquisition efforts.\n\nThe median seed round tripled from $272K to $750K between 2010 and 2016 according to analysis from Tom Tunguz over at Redpoint, and that growth extends to later rounds too. Companies across the board are raising bigger rounds, often from non-traditional investors, to drive growth for the next fundraise or for an exit (source: Quartz):\n\nIn the initial stages, this extra money enables buying early growth through testing and sub-scale campaigns to compliment organic growth. As a company scales, these bigger rounds buy you time and acquisition resources to build a defensible but expensive flywheel.\n\n2. Companies are trying paid marketing earlier\n\nThe good news about more companies trying paid acquisition is that it's easier than ever to experiment with paid marketing early. Self-serve ad systems are now the norm, which we can see from recent self-serve ad launches from newer platforms like Snap and Quora. Companies can test and master paid spend much earlier and run meaningful experiments with budget as low as $50. This allows an earlier and better understanding of unit economics and how to optimize the other steps in the funnel.\n\n\"Today, advertisers of all sizes expect platforms to offer them a number features as basic built-ins: self-serve, hyper-targeting, analytics, dynamic pricing. The way ad platforms are now structured with these features allows you to run small tests with sub-scale campaigns. It takes minimal time to make the creative, and it's super easy to do testing for startups and new products.\"\n\n\u2014 Sriram Krishnan, ex-Revenue Products at Snap, Mobile Ad"}

The photo of Barton appeared on an anonymous Twitter account. It was not immediately known who posted the photo or when it was taken.\n\nBarton, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and the longest-serving member of Congress from Texas, announced his re-election bid this month in a district that includes several counties in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Earlier on Wednesday, his spokeswoman told the Dallas Morning News he had no plans to step down.\n\nBarton issued a statement saying that while separated from his second wife, prior to their divorce in 2015, he had sexual relationships \"with other mature adult women\". The 68-year-old said each relationship was consensual and had ended.\n\n\"I am sorry I did not use better judgment during those days,\" said Barton. \"I am sorry that I let my constituents down.\"\n\nA woman whom the Post did not identify told the newspaper of Barton's threat over the sexually explicit photographs, videos and messages he had sent to her. The woman described sexual encounters and contact extending over five years, beginning with her posting a message on Barton's Facebook page in 2011.\n\n\nShe also shared with the Post a secretly recorded telephone conversation with Barton in 2015 in which he warned her against using the material \"in a way that would negatively affect my career\".\n\nThe Post reported that the woman, who is not married, spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her privacy.\n\nA message left at Barton's district office in Arlington, Texas, was not returned. The voicemail for his office in Washington was full.\n\nIn a statement to the Post, Barton said a transcript of the telephone conversation provided by the newspaper may be \"evidence\" of a \"potential crime against me\". He also said Capitol police had informed him on Wednesday they were opening an inquiry. Capitol police did not respond to a request for comment late on Wednesday.\n\nThere is no federal law prohibiting sharing intimate pictures of other adults without their consent. In 2015 Texas passed a revenge porn law which the Dallas Morning News said criminalized \"the act of intentionally disclosing pictures or videos 'depicting another person with the person's intimate parts exposed or engaged in sexual conduct' without their consent\".\n\nBarton was a consultant in the oil and gas industry before he joined the House in 1985. He is the vice-chairman of the powerful energy and commerce committee, which he chaired from 2004 to 2007.\n\n\nHe made headlines in 2010, when he apologised to BP for the company's treatment by Congress during hearings over the disastrous Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In 2013, he cited the biblical flood to dispute human links to climate change.\n\nBarton has been the longtime manager of the GOP congressional baseball team. In June, he was taking part in a team practice when a gunman opened fire, injuring another congressman and others."}

If you go beyond the literal meaning of this quote, I'm sure you'll find it as useful in your life as I have mine.\n\nThe words still ring just as true today as when I first heard Jennifer Aniston's boss say them in the movie. To this day, it is still one of my favorite, can't-get-enough-of \"chick-flicks\" (in fact, I'd put it up there with the top ten-and how Monster-in-Law didn't make the list, I don't know\u2026but that's another blog for another time). For those of you who are \"too cool\" for \"chick-flicks\" (hey, to each his own, right?) and are unfamiliar with the movie, Aniston plays a young and eager account executive who never gets the recognition she deserves in a job where she always produces, in boss language, BIG RESULTS. This inspires her to make some drastic moves, like claiming she's engaged to someone she's not, all in an effort to receive praise from important colleagues. At the end of the day though, her actions, ethical or not, didn't bring the payoff she was expecting because they weren't genuine.\n\nThe moral of the story, in my opinion, is to get up, dress up, and show up, EVERY SINGLE DAY.\n\nBelieve me, people take notice when you do AND when you don't.\n\nYour boss hired you to do your work well\u2026so don't expect a pat on the back every time you achieve that status. And if you do get those pats on the back, don't think your job is done. Keep going. Show up; don't give up. Remember\u2026your goal is to keep moving UP that ladder. On the flip side, if you're not quite the best at what you do yet, keep \"showing up\" and you'll still gain the respect you're looking for from your boss and colleagues.\n\nWhen I say \"show up\" everyday, I don't just mean dragging yourself into the office like this. I mean\u2026\n\nNever stop trying \u2013 This applies to even the best account executive out there. The second you stop trying or think you're good enough \"as is\", that's when \"the next best thing\" will take your place. You are never too wise to stop learning\u2026or too good to feel nervous \u2013 I was once told by one of my news anchor mentors, \"the second I stop getting nervous on air, is the second I shouldn't do this job anymore.\" The same theory applies in public relations and to all of your accounts. \"Showing up\" goes beyond your list of big media hits\u2013 \"show up\" and bring the whole package! Dress like you care, talk like you care, treat your colleagues and clients like they matter. After all, remember that your job title has Public Relations in it \u2013 building relationships with the people that matter is not part of your job description \u2013 it's ALL of your job description. Don't just do it for your clients, do it for yourself. \"Attitudes are contagious\u2026is yours worth catching?\" Need I say more\u2026\n\nHey, none of us are perfect and we've all felt like Aniston's character before \u2013 and we all have those days where we just don't feel like \"showing up.\" But take the advice of Jerry McGuire's mentor, Dicky Fox\u2014 greet each day at work as if you have something to prove - and remember what Jennifer Aniston's character showed us\u2026life's too short to sulk, deceive, or lack confidence. And in this day and age, quite frankly, the list of job openings is too short as well.\n\nBottom line, figure out the job you want to have and \"dress\" for it every day \u2013 I bet your boss, your colleagues (or someone your colleagues can introduce you to), will take notice and help you get there."}

One of the more impudent boys replied, \"We came to see you perform a miracle.\"\n\nThe teacher walked slowly over to the boy and menacingly responded, \"We don't perform miracles here, but we do cast out devils!\"\n\nFor some reason I feel impressed to speak today against the devil and his angels\u2014the source and mainspring of all evil. I do so prayerfully, because Satan is not an enlightening subject. I consider him to be the great imitator.\n\nI think we will witness increasing evidence of Satan's power as the kingdom of God grows stronger. I believe Satan's ever-expanding efforts are some proof of the truthfulness of this work. In the future the opposition will be both more subtle and more open. It will be masked in greater sophistication and cunning, but it will also be more blatant. We will need greater spirituality to perceive all of the forms of evil and greater strength to resist it. But the disappointments and setbacks to the work of God will be temporary, for the work will go forward (see D&C 65:2).\n\nIt is not good practice to become intrigued by Satan and his mysteries. No good can come from getting close to evil. Like playing with fire, it is too easy to get burned: \"The knowledge of sin tempteth to its commission\" (Joseph F. Smith, Gospel Doctrine, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939, p. 373). The only safe course is to keep well distanced from him and any of his wicked activities or nefarious practices. The mischief of devil worship, sorcery, casting spells, witchcraft, voodooism, black magic, and all other forms of demonism should be avoided like the plague.\n\nHowever, Brigham Young said that it is important to \"study \u2026 evil, and its consequences\" (Discourses of Brigham Young, comp. John A. Widtsoe, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1941, pp. 256\u201357). Since Satan is the author of all evil in the world, it would therefore be essential to realize that he is the influence behind the opposition to the work of God. Alma stated the issue succinctly: \"For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil\" (Alma 5:40).\n\nMy principal reason for choosing this subject is to help young people by warning them, as Paul said, \"lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices\" (2 Cor. 2:11). We hope that young people, unfamiliar with the sophistries of the world, can keep themselves free of Satan's enticements and deceitful ways. I personally claim no special insight into Satan's methods, but I have at times been able to identify his influence and his actions in my life and in the lives of others. When I was on my first mission, Satan sought to divert me from my future path and, if possible, to destroy my usefulness in the Lord's work. That was almost fifty years ago, and I still remember how reasonable his entreaties seemed.\n\nWho has not heard and felt the enticings of the devil? His voice often sounds so reasonable and his message so easy to justify. It is an enticing, intriguing voice with dulcet tones. It is neither hard nor discordant. No one would listen to Satan's voice if it sounded harsh or mean. If the devil's voice were unpleasant, it would not entice people to listen to it.\n\nShakespeare wrote, \"The prince of darkness is a gentleman\" (King Lear, act 3, sc. 4, line 143), and \"the devil can cite Scripture for his purpose\" (The Merchant of Venice, act 1, sc. 3, line 95). As the great deceiver, Lucifer has marvelous powers of deception. As Paul said to the Corinthians, \"And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light\" (2 Cor. 11:14; see also 2 Ne. 9:9).\n\nSome of Satan's most appealing lines are \"Everyone does it\"; \"If it doesn't hurt anybody else, it's all right\"; \"If you feel all right about it, it's OK\"; or \"It's the 'in' thing to do.\" These subtle entreaties make Satan the great imitator, the master deceiver, the arch counterfeiter, and the great forger.\n\nWe all have an inner braking system that will stop us before we follow Satan too far down the wrong road. It is the still, small voice which is within us. But once we have succumbed, the braking system begins to leak brake fluid and our stopping mechanism becomes weak and"}

Later that year, sleeper cells of terra retroviruses from Africa awoke in major urban centers following a heavy night of sex with the local monkeys. The resulting AIDS epidemic, which inflicted heavy casualties in several large American cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco, appeared to represent another victory for nature over civilization.\n\nWith thousands dead, the Reagan administration conducted a series of strikes and assaults against nature throughout the eighties. Fierce anti-nature activist James Watt was appointed Secretary of the Interior. Watt led many successful attacks on forest ecosystems and terra cells in the American west. Still, the dark toll on the American psyche was large. The personal and emotional scars left by the 1980 attacks ran so deep, that Reagan was emotionally unable to talk about AIDS and its victims until 1987. His silence will always be remembered by the American people.\n\nTerra strikes in the technological heartland of America with the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989.\n\nEventually, terra attacks seemed to wane. But at the beginning of the first Bush administration, nature extremists struck back at America's technological heartland. The Loma Prieta earthquake on October 17, 1989 caused 66 deaths and inflicted $6 billion of damage in the Bay Area. This new strike, which occurred during the 1989 World Series, again moved America into action.\n\nAccommodation and Negotiation in the 1990s [ edit ]\n\nDuring the latter half of the first Bush administration and during the Clinton administration, efforts were made to reach a negotiated settlement with the forces of nature. A series of accords and treaties were reached, culminating in the Kyoto peace treaty in the late 1990s, negotiated by Al Gore. It seemed that peaceful coexistence of nature and Planet Earth with America was imminent. However, a new threat to America had been developing. Richard Nixon, as part of an effort to oppose the Soviet Union agricultural victories over nature, had secretly begun funding of the EPA in 1970. One of its radical leaders, known only by his codename \"Mother Nature\", leader of the terrarists, would come to pose a major threat to America.\n\nThe War Against Terra (TWAT) begins [ edit ]\n\nAftermath of the 2001 extremist weather front attack on Texas. Note the presence of WMD.\n\nIn early 2001, the selection of Bush as president left the American people feeling optimistic. However, later that year, a series of attacks led by the forces of Mother Nature would shock America. In early June, an extreme weather front, Tropical Storm Allison, devastated Houston, Texas, killing 22 civilians and causing $5 billion of damage. An even more shocking attack occurred on September 11, as forces of gravity and oxidation, groups allied with Mother Nature, effected the collapse of the World Trade Center in New York City.\n\nThe Search for WMD [ edit ]\n\nThe attack on Houston had been one in a long series of attacks caused by extremist ocean ecosystems on the United States. The elimination of ocean ecosystems soon became a priority of U.S. foreign policy. In early 2002, the United States struck Afghanistan. Eventually, all ocean ecosystems harbored by the Afghan Taliban regime were eliminated and destroyed. In October 2002, the United States implemented policies designed to restrict the flow of critical components of the ocean ecosystem: whales, mollusks, and diatoms (or WMD).\n\nTWAT implementation - life is destroyed in Baghdad as part of The War on Terra.\n\nIn 2003, Bush ordered a controversial invasion of Iraq, justifying the attack by saying that Iraq was harboring a desire for ocean ecosystems."}

But although Every Open Eye doesn't necessarily have a stand-out single of that stature (few do), the overall consistency throughout the album serves to starkly define CHVRCHES as uniquely now; relevant; and above all, here to stay.\n\nThe time between their debut and sophomore record has seen subtle shifts in tone to '80s Miami and nods to the likes of M83 and Chromatics; Every Open Eye sounds lush, intense, and gloriously colorful (Spike Stent and Bob Ludwig's mixing and mastering work here is impeccable). And at the center of it all, Mayberry's vocals have never sounded better. Though there's a slight smoothing of her Scottish accent, her voice punctuates each song with utter charm and clarity and it's notable that when her vocals are absent or pushed to the back of the mix, the album's energy drops considerably. \"Leave a Trace\" glitters beautifully against her vocals and the fight between the verse and the chorus on \"Playing Dead\" is sumptuous. But it's on \"Make Them Gold\" that CHVRCHES truly soar-Mayberry's voice breaks through the darker tones of the early part of the record like sunlight breaking through darkened clouds. It's one of their best tracks to date and one that the center of the record is built around.\n\nThere is a small stumble on the diluted \"High Enough to Carry You Over,\" which without Mayberry on lead vocals and with over-gleaming synth lines sounds like a weaker Years and Years track. Equally, the following \"Empty Threat\" still sounds delectable but over-familiar\u2014a rehash rather than a redevelopment and an imitation rather than an improvement. But these are minor quibbles, with the album climbing towards its conclusion with the aforementioned \"Playing Dead\" neatly placed between the multi-layered swirl of \"Down Side of Me\" and the organ-tinged slow-burn of the closing \"Afterglow\"\u2014lush, beautifully unfolding, though teasingly never quite peaking as you'd imagine it would do.\n\nEvery Open Eye is the sound of a band moving steadily forward, while keeping one foot grounded in the origin of their success. No, it isn't any gargantuan leap, but it is a collection of expertly constructed luminous and shimmering pop tracks, honed with care and delivered with clarity. It has become par for the course for British electro-pop bands to stumble horridly when it comes to the follow-up to successful debuts. CHVRCHES not only look set to buck that trend, but to continue their upward trajectory towards the summit of their ambitions. (www.chvrch.es)\n\nAuthor rating: 8/10"}

It's the third year Google is running Chrome Dev Summit, and this year you could feel that the event is a new priority for Google.\n\nSource: Robert Nyman, https://www.flickr.com/photos/robertnyman/22956167599/\n\nChrome Dev Summit is rather small with roughly 300 participants, mainly from browser vendors, web standards folks, influencers and of course Googlers. This mix of people creates a unique atmosphere, much similar to EdgeConf, as everyone attending, are deeply involved with the web., which made the networking, discussions, and hallway track at this year's event simply fantastic.\n\nGoogle's vision for the Web\n\nThe first day was kicked off with a keynote by Darin Fisher, VP of Chrome, where he talked about the \"State of Chrome\". Darin provided a bunch of key milestones, numbers, and achievements by Chrome, which was great to see shared by a browser vendor. It's clear that Chrome continues to gather momentum, with more than 800 million users on mobile, in addition to its massive desktop base.\n\nThe web is a priority and a 1st class platform to build apps for Google\n\nThe main takeaway from this year's Chrome Dev Summit was that Google sees the web platform as a \"1st class platform\" in the app ecosystem. For some this might not be news, but in an Android dominated world, I think this is an incredibly powerful statement. It shows Google is committed to build the web, as an open platform, where competition and standards play an important role.\n\nIt gives me hope that we'll continue to see Google investing into Chrome and the web platform as alternative app platform to it's proprietary Android platform. Our current mobile platforms need an open alternative, and the web can be that.\n\nThe emphasis of the web being ready as a fully fledged application was implied in in most of the event's sessions. Each session showed how new primitives like Service Worker, Push Notifications and Physical Web, can be put together in into an incredibly compelling app model named Progressive Web App. Alex Russel coined Progressive Web Apps a few months ago, and is compelling because PWA's work across browser, devices, platforms and most importantly, vendors.\n\nSource: Robert Nyman, https://twitter.com/robertnyman/status/666667370912415744\n\nGoogle wants developers to build for the web, regardless of the targeted browser, platform and device, and that's huge!\n\nA flashback to the good days of Google I/O\n\nThis year's Chrome Dev Summit reminded me of the good days at Google I/O, where I attended to get an overview of how Chrome is doing and how Google sees the future of the web. I've been missing this., as Google I/O in the recently years has changed its focus to be the premier Android and Google Cloud event.\n\nThe change of Google I/O is a natural consequence of Android growing and Google focusing on a broader variety of products, but this broader focus has also meant that going to Google I/O as a front-end/web developer, isn't very attractive anymore. Google I/O has simply lost it's value, as the number of sessions related to the web have declined to almost zero.\n\nA web-focused event from Google has been much needed, as they continue to be driving many important initiatives on the web, and with Chrome Dev Summit they have filled that gap.\n\nGoogle I/O 2011. Source: Danny Sullivan, http://searchengineland.com/live-blogging-the-google-io-2011-day-2-chrome-keynote-76766\n\nWish all browser vendors did the same\n\nChrome Dev Summit was great, but the web is more than once vendor and is built by multiple browsers, implementations and opinions coming together. It's important for us making to the web, to have each vendor sharing its vision for the web, but so far we mostly heard about Google's.\n\nGoing forward I hope this will change, and we'll see all the major browser vendors doing events similar to Chrome Dev Summit. Microsoft has already stepped up by doing it's first Edge Dev Summit, so let's see what the future brings.\n\nMaybe someday we can have all browsers vendors present at the same event?\n\nThat would be wonderful.\n\nAnd Google, why didn't you just call it \"Chrome Summit\"? Much easier to say, remember and a shorter hashtag :)"}

All seven suspects are accused of aggravated assault; five are also accused of obstructing justice. An indictment against three minors who allegedly took part in the incident, two weeks ago, was also filed in the Jerusalem District Juvenile Court; they, too, are accused of aggravated assault.\n\nThe prosecution is seeking remand in custody for all 10 suspects until the conclusion of legal proceedings.\n\nThe violent incident took place in an area between Beit Hanina and the Neveh Yaakov neighborhood in northern Jerusalem. Amir Shweiki and Samer Mahfouz from Beit Hanina, both 20 years old, were set upon by a mob of Jewish youths in an unprovoked attack, and brutally beaten with baseball bats and iron bars. Shweiki was seriously injured and is still hospitalized with a head injury in the neurosurgical ward at Hadassah University Hospital, Ein Karem. Mahfouz was lightly injured, but last week was hospitalized again after his condition deteriorated.\n\nAccording to the indictment filed by attorney Yael Igra Unger, on the night in question, Shweiki and Mahfouz were sitting in a public park in Neveh Yaakov: \"At a certain point, one of the accused came up to the plaintiffs and asked if they had a cigarette and a lighter in order to ascertain whether the plaintiffs were Arabs. The plaintiffs said no and he left. A few minutes later, all of the accused plus three minors approached the plaintiffs as a group, armed with iron bars and boards.\"\n\nThen, says the prosecution, \"the accused and the minors surrounded the plaintiffs, calling out, 'Arabs, Arabs \u2026' Curses were exchanged. Then the accused and the minors pounced as one on the plaintiffs, some of them wielding iron bars and wooden bats, and began savagely beating the plaintiffs, just because they are Arabs. One of the accused struck one of the plaintiffs on the head very forcefully from behind with a baseball bat; another one struck him with his fist and the plaintiff fell to the ground and lost consciousness. Meanwhile, some of the accused and the minors beat the second plaintiff with iron bars, fists and kicks until he too fell to the ground and lost consciousness for a few minutes.\"\n\nEven after the two young Palestinians lost consciousness, the incident didn't end.\n\n\"The accused and the minors continued to beat the plaintiffs as they lay on the ground,\" says the indictment. \"They beat them fiercely with iron bars and fists, and kicked them hard in the head and face, and all over their bodies. Then the accused and the minors immediately ran away, leaving the plaintiffs lying on the ground in the park, bleeding.\"\n\nThe charges of obstruction of justice relate to what occurred following the attack. At that time, according to the indictment, five of the adult suspects and one of the minors met. They were concerned that someone might have seen them beating the Arab men, and agreed that if anyone were arrested by the police \"he won't say anything.\" In addition, \"a few days later, one of the accused instructed another one to delete everything in his phone.\"\n\nThe beating of Mahfouz and Shweiki marked a peak in the violence and harassment against Palestinians in Jerusalem in recent weeks. Among other incidents, Arab taxi drivers have been beaten or attacked with tear gas, riders on the light rail train have been harassed, and passersby have been subjected to verbal and physical violence."}

In fact, Rand Paul's words to the Courier-Journal, in their editorial board interview, were even more extreme than the paper's editorial reveal.\n\nThe interview that reveals Rand Paul's views on civil rights was done in April. People have linked to the editorial, but the transcript has not been circulated.\n\nConway's charge today on \"Hardball\" sent me searching. Below is a transcript (the piece below is at the very end of the interview):\n\nQuestion: Would you have voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\n\nRand Paul: I like the Civil Rights Act in the sense that it ended discrimination in all public domains and I'm all in favor of that.\n\nQuestioner: But...?\n\nRand Paul: (nervous laugh) You had to ask me the \"but.\" um.. I don't like the idea of telling private business owners - I abhor racism - I think it's a bad business decision to ever exclude anybody from your restaurant. But at the same time I do believe in private ownership. But I think there should be absolutely no discrimination on anything that gets any public funding and that's most of what the Civil Rights Act was about to my mind.\n\nQuestioner: And then it was extended by most to most localities to include all... Would you be in favor of just local--\n\nRand Paul: On a local basis it might be a little different. The thing is I would speak out in favor of it. (pause) I mean, I look at the speeches of Martin Luther King, and I tell you I become emotional watching the speeches of Martin Luther King. I love it because he was a transformational figure... [...] (goes on to talk about Martin Luther King for a few moments)\n\nQuestioner: But under your philosophy it would be okay for Dr. King to not be served at the counter at Woolworths?\n\nRand Paul: I would not go to that Woolworth's, and I would stand up in my community and say it's abhorrent. um... But the hard part, and this is the hard part about believing in freedom is, if you believe in the First Amendment, for example, you to, for example-- most good defenders will believe in abhorrent groups standing up and saying awful things, and we're here at the bastion of newspaperdom (sic) and I'm sure you believe in the First Amendment, so I'm sure you understand people can say bad things. It's the same way with other behaviors. In a free society we will tolerate boorish people who have abhorrent behavior, but if we're civilized people we publicly criticize that and don't belong to those groups or associate with those people.\n\nQuestioner: But it's different with race, certainly a hundred years, discrimination based on race was codified under federal law.\n\nRand Paul: Exactly, it was institutionalize and that's why we had to end all of the institutional racism in um.. I was in favor of completely of that ...\n\nIt's just stunning.\n\nThe current playbook being used by Rand Paul was first used in Virginia by Bob McDonnell, regardless of whether they know each other or not. It's simply how ultra conservative candidates are running their races, focusing on economic issues, while hiding their extreme views on social issues, including women's rights, but also on civil rights where Rand Paul is concerned.\n\nThere is an undercurrent of opinion dogging the Tea Party that posits they are racist. It has also dogged the Republican Party since their Southern strategy was implemented, of which the Tea Party is an extreme element.\n\nFrom the Louisville Courier-Journal editorial board, after their interview with Rand Paul, an article entitled \"In Republican Senate race, a dismal choice\" was an indictment on the Republicans in the race. That was an understatement where Rand Paul is concerned.\n\nThe trouble with Dr. Paul is that despite his independent thinking, much of what he stands for is repulsive to people in the mainstream. For instance, he holds an unacceptable view of civil rights, saying that while the federal government can enforce integration of government jobs and facilities, private business people should be able to decide whether they want to serve black people, or gays, or any other minority group. He quickly emphasizes that he personally would not agree with any form of discrimination, but he just doesn't think it should be legislated. His perspectives -- like Mr. Grayson's -- are repellent to those who believe in a woman's right to choose whether to have an abortion. Indeed, Dr. Paul wouldn't even permit exceptions in the case of rape or incest. He says the mother and the unborn zygote have equal rights.\n\nIf you still care, considering Paul's civil rights views, on Sarah Palin being qualified to be president he says \"absolutely,\" also saying he feels \"a"}

The tourists survived.\n\nThe elephant riding industry is extremely lucrative in Koh Samui. Local officials and tour operators apparently sought to protect its commercial interests with varying explanations for the animal's behaviour.\n\nThere were initial local media reports that Mr Crowe had teased the animal by appearing to offer it a banana after dismounting to take a photograph. But those were quickly denied by Eilidh in a comment on a local news website.\n\nThen island officials said they suspected that \"hot weather made the elephant angry\" \u2013 a confusing claim as the elephants are native Asian animals and temperatures at the time were about the average 30C.\n\nMr Samattapong said that the elephant had been tranquillised and brought under control and was now being treated."}

That required both a smooth tunnel and a smooth camera. In this article we look at how I constructed the tunnel and smoothed it using Catmull-Rom splines.\n\nTo better feel the experience of the smooth tunnel, I suggest downloading the game for iPad or iPhone. Radial Blitz \u2013 A high paced 3d reaction game\n\nTunnel segments\n\nThe tunnel is comprised of many, relatively short, segments. While playing there are only about 10 segments at any given time. As they disappear behind the camera they are removed and a new one is added to the front end of the tunnel. This both limits the amount of geometry drawn per frame, but also prevents the tunnel from ever intersecting itself (which it might otherwise do).\n\nEach segment has has only two key geometry properties:\n\nto : The location at at the end of this segment. This is float3 point defining the middle of the tunnel fragment.\n\n: The location at at the end of this segment. This is point defining the middle of the tunnel fragment. orient : The direction the tunnel is facing at the end of the segment. This is a float4 quaternion, which also encodes the \"up\" direction.\n\nThese are stored as a doubly-linked list, the calculations need the previous and next segments. The chain of to positions defines the core structure of the tunnel.\n\nInstead of orient I previously using two float3 values, one for the facing direction and one for the up direction. If you were standing on a tile in the tunnel, with your feet pointing to the front of the tile, the facing is a vector defining which way, in world space, you would be looking. The up vector is the world direction from your feet to your head.\n\nStoring two values is kind of wasteful, and somewhat unstable. A single float4 quaternion is able to encode both of those values, and can be directly interpolated. The facing and up vectors are derived as needed.\n\nCreating segments\n\nDeciding the values for the segments wasn't hard, but involved a lot of fine tuning. To create the next segment I need to extend from the previous one, getting the position and facing at the end of the next segment.\n\nTo create a straight segment I'd take the facing vector at the end of the previous one and multiply it by the segment length. To provide some variation I add some random rotation to the vector. In order not to create too chaotic of a tunnel, this rotation is held for several segments. This results in long smooth tunnel corners.\n\nThe variance parameters are all controlled by the levels, thus allowing some levels to be more chaotic and bendy than others. There's also an upgrade in the game that reduces the variatian: aiming in a straight tunnel is easier than a bendy one.\n\nInterpolating\n\nIf the segments were simply straight sections between the to positions, the tunnel would feel rather jagged. This is a video showing what that might look like. Notice the sharp delineation between segments and how the camera changes are also abrupt: adjusting for sudden changes in facing .\n\nIn graphics and animation the answer to any question of smoothing is usually splines. Likely a cubic spline as well, since everybody loves t^3 values. This answer is of course quite general as there are many ways to satisfy the values in a spline.\n\nThe Catmull-Rom values are suitable for path smoothing in games. There's even built-in functions in DirectX for this type of spline.\n\nA spline just lets us interpolate between two points, creating a smooth transition from one to the other. To interpolate we actually an additional two points, the one before the first and after the second. These four points are the control points, and define the overall curve. With these values we can calculate an interpolated position at t , the unit interval in the range 0...1 : when t=0 we should be at point and when t=1 at point .\n\nCode details\n\nThe control points are only scalars, thus the equation needs to be done for each dimension in the position, and also for each component of the quaternions. This calculation defines the structure of the tunnel itself, not just the mesh defining the visuals. It needs to be done a lot, per-frame, when calculating where all the game objects are located. For each segment however, most of the calculation can be pre-calculated.\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 intOrient = float4x4( SplineParams( av.X, bv.X, cv.X, dv.X ), SplineParams( av.Y, bv.Y, cv.Y, dv.Y ), SplineParams( av."}

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game, originally released back in the 1960s. The goal of the game is to uncover a mine field while trying to not trigger any of the mines. After uncovering an element without a mine, the game will always show a number that indicates the amount of surrounding mines. This adds a nice strategic aspect to the game.\n\nWhat sounds simple is actually so much fun that different versions of Minesweeper are frequently included in some of the major operating systems.\n\nOur Minesweeper clone will be really simple, with only 85 lines of code and some pixel art. We will learn quite a few things about Unity programming and implement the popular Flood Fill algorithm.\n\nAs usual, everything will be explained as easy as possible so everyone can understand it.\n\nRequirements\n\nKnowledge\n\nOur Tutorial does not require any special Unity skills besides some knowledge about the basics like GameObjects and Transforms. Understanding recursion (a function calling itself) will definitely come in handy for the Flood Fill algorithm.\n\nFeel free to read our easier Unity Tutorials like Unity 2D Pong Game if you want to get used to this powerful (yet simple) game engine first.\n\nUnity Version\n\nOur Minesweeper Tutorial will use Unity 5.0.0f4. Newer versions should work fine as well, older versions may or may not work. The free version of Unity 5 now comes with all the engine features, which makes it the recommended version.\n\nProject Setup\n\nLet's get to it. We will start Unity and select New Project:\n\n\nWe will name it minesweeper, select any location like C:\\, select 2D and click Create Project:\n\n\nNow we can modify the Camera to make sure that the game will be in the middle of the screen later. At first we will select the Main Camera in the Hierarchy and then set the Background Color to black. We will also modify the Size and the Position like shown in the following image:\n\n\nThe Default Element\n\nLet's add the default elements to our game. The default elements are those that we see if we didn't click on one yet. Their purpose is to hide whatever is below them.\n\nAt first we will need some kind of image that we can use. We will keep it simple and draw a 16 x 16 pixel image in a drawing tool like Paint.NET:\n\n\nNote: right click on the image, select Save As... and save it in the project's Assets folder.\n\nAfter saving it in our Assets folder, we can select the image in the Project Area:\n\n\nAnd then we can modify the Import Settings in the Inspector:\n\n\nNote: the Import Settings specify how big the image is in the final game, and if some kind of compression should be used or not.\n\nAlright, now we can drag the image from the Project Area into the Scene:\n\n\nNote: everything in the Project Area is just a file, something we may or may not use for our game. Once we drag our default element into the Scene it becomes part of the game world.\n\nLet's select the default element in the Scene or in the Hierarchy and then take a look over to the Inspector.

In the background of the lovely fun, smiles and laughter that we had that weekend was the knowledge of what was coming.\"\n\nMs Davis worked out a detailed schedule for the gathering on the weekend of July 23-24, including the precise hour she planned to slip into a coma, and shared her plans with her guests in the invitation.\n\nMore than 30 people came to the party at a home with a wraparound porch in the picturesque Southern California mountain town of Ojai, flying in from New York, Chicago and across California.\n\nOne woman brought a cello. A man played a harmonica. There were cocktails, pizza from her favourite local joint, and a screening in her room of one of her favourite movies, \"The Dance of Reality,\" based on the life of a Chilean film director.\n\nAs the weekend drew to a close, her friends kissed her goodbye, gathered for a photo and left, and Ms Davis was wheeled out to a canopy bed on a hillside, where she took a combination of morphine, pentobarbital and chloral hydrate prescribed by her doctor.\n\nKelly Davis said she loved her sister's idea for the gathering.\n\n\"Obviously it was hard for me. It's still hard for me,\" said her sister, who wrote about it for the online news outlet Voice of San Diego. \"The worst was needing to leave the room every now and then, because I would get choked up. But people got it. They understood how much she was suffering and that she was fine with her decision. They respected that. They knew she wanted it to be a joyous occasion.\"\n\nMs Davis took her life a little over a month after a California law giving the option to the terminally ill went into effect. Four other states allow doctor-assisted suicide, with Oregon the first in 1997.\n\nOpponents of the law warn it could become a way out for people who are uninsured or fearful of high medical bills.\n\nMarilyn Golden of the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund, said her heart goes out to anyone dealing with a terminal illness, but \"there are still millions of people in California threatened by the danger of this law.\"\n\nMs Davis spent months planning her exit, feeling empowered after spending the last three years losing control of her body bit by bit. The painter and performance artist could no longer stand, brush her teeth or scratch an itch. Her caretakers had to translate her slurred speech for others.\n\n\"Dear rebirth participants you're all very brave for sending me off on my journey,\" she wrote in her invitation. \"There are no rules. Wear what you want, speak your mind, dance, hop, chant, sing, pray, but do not cry in front of me. Oh, OK one rule.\"\n\nDuring the party, old friends reconnected and Ms Davis rolled in and out of the rooms in her electric wheelchair and onto the porch, talking with her guests.\n\nAt one point, she invited friends to her room to try on the clothes she had picked out for them. They modelled the outfits to laughter. Guests were also invited to take a \"Betsy souvenir\" \u2014 a painting, beauty product or other memento. Her sister had placed sticky notes on the items, explaining each one's significance.\n\nWearing a Japanese kimono she bought on a bucket-list trip she took after being diagnosed in 2013, she looked out at her last sunset and took the drugs in the evening with her caretaker, her doctor, her massage therapist and her sister by her side. Four hours later, she died.\n\nFriends said it was the final performance for the artist, who once drew pictures on a stage with whipped cream.\n\n\"What Betsy did gave her the most beautiful death that any person could ever wish for,\" Mr Alpert said. \"By taking charge, she turned her departure into a work of art.\""}

The eye opening (palpebral fissure) narrows and the eyeball retracts into the orbit when looking inward toward the nose (adduction). When looking outward toward the ear (abduction), the reverse occurs.\n\nDuane syndrome Type 2: The ability to move the affected eye(s) inward toward the nose (adduction) is limited, whereas the ability to move the eye outward (abduction) is normal or only slightly limited. The eye opening (palpebral fissure) narrows and the eyeball retracts into the orbit when the affected eye(s) attempts to look inward toward the nose (adduction).\n\nDuane syndrome Type 3: The ability to move the affected eye(s) both inward toward the nose (adduction) and outward toward the ear (abduction) is limited. The eye opening narrows and the eyeball retracts when the affected eye(s) attempts to look inward toward the nose (adduction).\n\nEach of these three types has been further classified into three subgroups designated A, B, and C to describe the eyes when looking straight (in primary gaze). In subgroup A, the affected eye is turned inward toward the nose (esotropia). In subgroup B, the affected eye is turned outward toward the ear (exotropia), and in subgroup C, the eyes are in a straight primary position.\n\nDifferent clinical types may be present within the same family, suggesting that the same genetic defect may produce a range of clinical presentations.\n\nThe most common clinical presentation is Type 1 DS (78 percent of cases) followed by Type 3 (15 percent) and Type 2 (7 percent). Involvement of both eyes (bilateral) is less common than involvement of one eye only (unilateral). Approximately 80-90 percent of cases are unilateral. Of the unilateral cases, the left eye is more often affected (72 percent). Amblyopia (reduced visual acuity in an eye) due to a lack of binocular vision occurs in about 10% of DS cases and is more common in familial autosomal dominant CHN1 gene familial cases.\n\nDuane syndrome is usually an isolated finding (approximately 70 percent), but may be associated with other malformations. Major anomalies associated with DS can be grouped into five categories: skeletal, auricular (having to do with the ears), ocular (having to do with the eyes) and neural (having to do with the nervous system) and renal (having to do with the kidneys and urinary tract).\n\nDS can also be associated with other well-defined syndromes. These include Okihiro's, Wildervanck, Holt-Oram, Goldenhar and M\u00f6bius syndromes."}

The brand with the tagline first coined by Shrek: \"Fear of God is like an onion.\" \"Their prices make you cry?\" \"NO! Layers. Onions have layers. Fear of God is all about layers.\" Their recent season 4 lookbook evokes the grunge look of the 90s, with flannels and a heavy focus on denim pieces. It calls to mind the small, rural towns where the sports stars of yesteryear always seemed to hail from. Founder Jerry Lorenzo has opted to buck the trend of \"all-slim-everywhere\" as \"too rocker\", opting instead for more drapey top layers and playing with different kinds of materials; one notable standout being the sherpa hoodie.\n\nWhether you believe Fear of God started some of the current trends towards bomber jackets and extended hem lines for layering, or merely hopped aboard said trends, that look has become ubiquitous. This allows you to sample such fast fashion staples as H&M, providing plenty of options for cheap bombers (see our frugal friday for more options) and other basics. It becomes a question of what you are paying for.\n\nA step above H&M is contemporary streetwear brand Elwood Clothing. Their longline tees such as their curved hem tees work great for layering and achieving the Fear of God style at a very reasonable price.\n\nAs you move up the price ladder, the quality and construction obviously get better, but you can replicate the look with cheap basics pretty well. Brands such as wemoto offer a solid compromise on the price, while still affording you the ability to build solid outfits without breaking the bank. They carry a range of interesting bomber jackets and outerwear, generally priced around \u20ac100, combined with some interesting button downs and shirts. However, the Fear of God look is so heavily based on layers that your best bet is to sample multiple brands to find the pieces you need.\n\nAn additional option is represent clothing, offering extended tees in varying neutral colors, ideal as a bottom layer. Staples such as Levi's provide established quality on denim jackets. Ultimately, you are looking for layers, layers, layers, and it is unlikely that all those layers will come from the same brand, meaning you will want to draw upon a range of options.\n\nHopefully you've enjoyed this post of Budget Alternatives!

The gameplay is slower then a normal Street Fighter player would be use to, but that does not take away from the gameplay at all. The game incorporates the actual actors into the game, which is a first for the street fighter dynasty, making the graphics look more like an early Mortal Kombat game. The gameplay however, is still the authentic Capcom fighting that we have grown to love. The story mode of the game, which pits you up against various characters from the movie, revealing dialogue before each fight differs from the actual storyline of the movie. You fight characters who were your allies, and you fight others who never crossed Guile's path in the movie. This setup however, leads to an interesting game, as you are not fully aware of what will happen next and the player is given the option of choosing different paths, allowing for repeated unique gameplay. The versus mode in the game, holds true to the street fighter identity, allowing for hours of fun with family and friends alike. The one problem with the game is missing characters. Dhalsim and T. Hawk were oddly left out of the game, which does not add up because Sawada, a side character from the movie, who was not in any previous Street Fighter game was included. The absence of these characters becomes even more mind boggeling when it is learned that Akuma is a special character in this game. Akuma, a long time fan favorite, was not even in the movie, but somehow snuck into the game, replacing two movie characters, who could have been included at least as special characters. Now Street Fighter: the Movie: the Game, may not be the greatest Street Fighter game of all time, but it is still an amazing and unique game that deserves attention from die hard Street Fighter fans. Regardless of if you liked or hated the movie, this game is one of the greats and is definately a gem in any video game collection.Read full review"}

To see why, let's first look at the raw Yes/No results reported since the beginning of 2012 (see the graph on the right \u2014 click on it for a larger version; all data from Wikipedia).\n\nAt a first glance, the picture isn't very clear. Some pollsters are showing a strong movement \u2014 for instance, TNS BMRB is showing an enormous fall in the number of No voters since early 2013 \u2014 but it's hard to spot a uniform pattern.\n\nTo make the results more comparable, many experienced psephologists recommend excluding the undecided voters (see for instance this blog post by John Curtice from last September). If we do that, Ipsos MORI, TNS BMRB and YouGov move closer together, but there are still huge differences (see the graph on the right).\n\nVery broadly speaking, it does look like Ipsos MORI, TNS BMRB and YouGov are in agreement, just as Angus Reid and ICM seem to concur, and Panelbase appears to be on its own. There's no way to conclude at this stage who's right and who's wrong (we won't know until the day after the referendum), but the gap between the first group and the second one is about six percentage points, and the gap between the second one and the third one is about three points.\n\nIf we adjust the opinion polls by this amount, it becomes much easier to spot common trends. Of course, nobody knows for sure which pollster to use as the target, so I've done this exercise three times, once for each pollster group. However, to save space I've only included the graph where Angus Reid and ICM were to chosen to be the target that the other pollsters were brought into line with (see the graph on the right).\n\nWhen displayed like this, it becomes very clear that the support for the No side seems to have peaked around the summer of 2013, and that Yes has been rising ever since.\n\nIf we were to draw a trend line through the results since August 2013, these adjusted figures would lead us to expect a very respectable Yes victory (55% to 45%), and Yes should overtake No in polls adjusted this way around mid May (the trend line isn't shown on the graph).\n\nOn the other hand, if we adjust Panelbase, Angus Reid and ICM to force them into line with Ipsos MORI, TNS BMRB and YouGov, the trend line leads to the conclusion that Yes will lose by a bawhair (49% to 51%).\n\nAnd finally, if we adjust all the other polls to bring them into line with Panelbase, it looks like Yes will win by a landslide (58% to 42%) and that Yes will overtake No as early as late February.\n\nTo summarise, if Ipsos MORI, TNS BMRB and YouGov are right about the proportion of Yes voters, we should expect a very close referendum result if the current trends continue; if ICM and Angus Reid are right, we'll see a solid Yes victory; and if Panelbase are right, we'll get a Yes landslide.\n\nThere's a lot of work still to be done for the Yes side, but it's very clear why the No campaign is starting to panic."}

He hunts down some of the deadliest aliens in the galaxy as sport. Unlike the first game, players controlled the hunter, rather than the hunted.\n\n\nThe game was set on an unknown alien planet. Although the planet itself revolves around a sun-like star, the actual planet itself does not spin, meaning that the planet is composed of three distinct areas of light - roughly equivalent to daylight, dusk and night-time. In the game, these three areas would act as hub areas. The first and only environment that has been revealed so far is the city.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game featured a reputation system as well as choices. Players were free to do whatever they want in the game world, be it mug people or search for bounties. The way players interacted with the environment ultimately decided how the environment reacts to Killian. For example, if players got a job that consists of retrieving weapons, players could have chosen to bring back the weapons or keep them; each outcome was to have its own consequences.\n\nPrey 2 traded the linear progression of the first game for a open world environment centred around verticality. To get around, the game featured a parkour system that was similar to the SMART system in Brink. Killian also had available a pair of rocket boots that he could trigger right before hitting the ground, in order to safely descend.\n\nThe player was to be able to choose how to take out enemies, be it through stealth or brute force, while some bounties would trigger scripted events such as chases. To make hunting easier, Samuels had access to a special view mode where he can scan groups of people to see if any have bounties over their heads. This could be done outside of missions while exploring the environment.\n\nRumors of Cancellation and Delay\n\nFollowing E3 2011, where the game was shown behind closed doors and a trailer was released, Prey 2 disappeared for nine months. When most of the Prey 2 panels were cancelled at GDC 2012, some assumed that the game had been outright cancelled.\n\nOn April 20, 2012 Bethesda sent out a press release stating that Prey 2 was still in development and had been delayed due to the fact that it didn't match Bethesda's quality standards.\n\nIt was further revealed that development for the game had been stopped in November 2011. Human Head wished to re-negotiate their contract with ZeniMax, believing that the terms of their current contract were not fair. Many members of Human Head were laid off during this strike period which lasted at least until March 2, 2012.\n\nOn October 30th, 2014, Prey 2 was announced to be officially cancelled by Bethesda."}
{"id": 807, "ended": true, "length": 691, "text": "The short answer to both your questions are Yes. The long answer is, it's not so simple.\n\nThe ATR 72 you have pictured has a top speed of 276 knots and a range of 1,300 miles. It can carry around 70 passengers.\n\nThis document provides detailed comparisons of burn rates. So we can see the ATR 72 burns about 810 Liters per hour (about 214 gallons/hr). A Boeing 737-400 seats about 150, has a maximum range of about 2,400 miles, and a cruising speed of about 473 knots (almost double the range, and over 1.5 times the speed). But its burn rate is about 3,000 liters per hour (793 gallons).\n\nSo is it a strict trade-off? Speed for Efficiency? Well, not entirely.\n\nTAS is true airspeed. That is, the speed of the aircraft relative to the airmass in which it is flying . However, an decrease in density (e.g. high altitudes; air is less dense) will yield an increase in TAS. Thus, it is easier to fly at the same true airspeed at higher altitudes. Since jets are generally used on longer flights (where much of the time in the air is spent at high cruise altitude), they have to work less to fly the same speed as they would 10,000 feet below. There are other reasons why jets are more efficient at high altitudes - they have to combine less fuel with the thinner air, and there is less drag at high altitudes.\n\nSo why don't propeller planes fly at high altitudes then? Well, part of it is that turboprops are less efficient at higher speeds and higher altitudes, and jets (turbofans) are more efficient at both (obviously to a point, but airliners don't fly fast or high enough to decrease their efficiency again).\n\nSince jet engines can also produce more thrust, they are better suited to large airplanes, which are the ones used for long distances (e.g. if you wanted a propeller plane the size of an Airbus A380, you would need a lot more than 4 engines). So jets are used in situations where they are more economical, and props where they are more economical.\n\nIn summary:\n\nTurboprop characteristics\n\nEfficient at low speed, low altitude\n\nLow thrust\n\nThis leads to smaller aircraft on shorter, slower routes, like you've observed, since they don't have to climb or fly fast to get there in a reasonable amount of time. Also these short hops generally require fewer passengers, or flying a second flight is better than needing a much bigger plane.\n\nTurbofan characteristics\n\nEfficient at high speed, high altitude\n\nHigh thrust\n\nThis leads to larger aircraft on longer, faster routes, like you've observed, since they need to fly higher and faster to get there in a reasonable amount of time. Also since these routes are more \"popular\", and it costs so much to fly that far, it makes more sense to put more passengers on one plane, than two.\n\nIn general, an airline would not sacrifice fuel for faster flights if that was the only advantage, unless they knew there could be a price premium for the faster flight (e.g. Concorde)."}

Beverly Lunt go suck my dick.\"\n\nSoon afterwards, his brother Samuel, 22, wrote: \"What a day it's been Burnley crown court! Up ur arse aha nice 2 year suspended.\"\n\nBrothers remanded after abusing judge on Facebook Read more\n\nThe defendants, from Accrington, Lancashire, were recalled for a sentence review when the remarks were brought to the attention of the judge, after she had previously heard their expressions of remorse for offending.\n\nOn Friday, Lunt said: \"The question I have to ask myself is this: if I had known their real feelings at being in court, would I have accepted their remorse and contrition, and suspended the sentence? And the answer is: of course not.\n\n\"Each of the posts indicate they have not changed at all. They have not taken on board anything or learned any responsibility.\"\n\nThe Sleddens originally received two-year prison terms, suspended for two years, after they admitted being concerned in the supply of cannabis between May and September 2014. Both will now serve two years after the suspension was lifted by Lunt.\n\nSitting at Preston crown court, Lunt said the posts contained \"offensive and sexual content directed at me as a judge and also as a woman\".\n\n\nShe added: \"These were not private entries in a diary. They were placed on Facebook with the intention that others should and would read them and, if they wished, would share them. So it was a limitless audience.\n\n\"Their content is clearly indicative of how they really felt about appearing in court for this particular offence. Their tenor was boastful and jeering, and the only reasonable inference was they thought they had somehow fooled and misled the court.\"\n\nDaniel Sledden's online post was later deleted but only because he had been advised to do so by his solicitors, said the judge. She said: \"Neither defendant had thought there was anything regrettable in them or decided to delete them themselves.\"\n\nBoth brothers had since written letters of apology to the judge, the court heard. Lunt continued: \"These are two grown men. They are not children showing off. They both knew exactly what they were doing. They did not care who saw what they had written. Now I have no doubt that they are sorry they were caught.\"\n\nShe said Daniel Sledden's pre-sentence report had referred to his regret at being involved in the offence and him blaming links with his own family. His barrister told his sentencing hearing that his client had taken \"positive steps\" by gaining employment.\n\nSamuel Sledden was said in his pre-sentence report to have been remorseful for his actions and felt \"stupid\" for committing the offence. He too had since found work and had returned to college, the court heard.\n\nLunt said such expressions of remorse were \"vital criteria\" when taking into account the appropriate sentence for a defendant. She said she had based her original sentence on the delay in the case being sentenced, and their lack of offending since, together with their guilty pleas and their apparent contrition. But the terms of the suspension were now revoked following her review.\n\nBoth brothers were remanded in custody 10 days ago while the transcript of the mitigation and sentencing remarks was obtained."}

{"id": 821, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Personal impressions into the matter aside for the moment, social science examining the issue of sex differences in manipulation skill and proclivity to manipulate are scarce. But a recent study definitely fingers women as the more manipulative sex in at least one major life domain.\n\nParental mate choice manipulation tactics: Exploring prevalence, sex and personality effects. Parents and children are genetically related but not genetically identical, which means that their genetic interests overlap but also diverge. In the area of mating, this translates into children making mate choices that are not in the best interest of their parents. Parents may then resort to manipulation in order to influence their children's mating decisions in a way that best promotes the former's interests. This paper attempts to identify the structure of manipulation tactics that parents employ on their daughters and sons, as well as on their daughters' and sons' mates, and also to estimate their prevalence. On the basis of the structure of the derived tactics, four hypotheses are tested: Mothers are more willing than fathers to use manipulation tactics; parents are willing to use more manipulation on their daughters than on their sons; the personality of parents predicts the use of tactics on their children and on their children's mates; and the personality of children and of children's mates predicts the use of tactics on them. Evidence from two independent studies provides support for the first three hypotheses, but mixed support for the fourth hypothesis. The implications of these findings are further discussed.\n\nSo mothers are more apt than are fathers to manipulate their children. What is the underlying evolutionary reason for this particular sex disparity?\n\nWomen being physically weaker, having less access to weaponry, having little control over wealth, and consequently being less aggressive, need to resort to manipulation in order to promote their interests effectively. [\u2026] Furthermore, due to internal gestation, mothers are 100% certain that their children are their own; this is not the case for fathers, however, who are less certain about paternity. This indicates that mothers see their interests as being more overlapping with the interests of their children, and so they have a stronger concern about the latter's mate choices. For instance, a bad mate choice on behalf of their children that compromises the fitness of their grandchildren (e.g., a mate who is likely to run away) will be more costly to mothers, who are certain that these grandchildren are actually their own, than to fathers, who are less certain. Accordingly, mothers will be more likely to interfere than fathers if they believe that a choice is not good for their daughters or sons.\n\nThis female facility with manipulation extends to the romantic sphere. In a state of nature (no Pills, no abortion, no female economic self-sufficiency or legal coddling), women run a MUCH greater risk of life-altering changes from a single act of loving penetration. Manipulation is the tool women use to level the playing field\u2026 or, more precisely, to tilt the playing field to their advantage in a modern social environment where every lever is already halfway pulled in their direction.\n\nThe irony of this biomechanic reality is that it runs totally counter to feminist and white knight blather about \"manipulative cads/PUAs/niceguys/jerks/patriarchal oppressors\". The intimate, limbic knowledge that women are in fact the more manipulative sex drives self-regarding women (and their effeminate male custodians) to project this instinctive female power onto their protagonists. This is especially true of ugly women who most certainly feel the burn of male rejection and female ostracism more hotly.\n\nAnother consequence of the asymmetry in parental investment, with women being a scarce reproductive resource, is that parents are more interested in controlling the mate choices of their daughters than of their sons (Perilloux, Fleischman, and Buss, 2008). In particular, as men strive to gain access to women, by controlling the latter, parents can better control mate choice (Apostolou, 2010). Furthermore, due to the risk of pregnancy and the value that men ascribe to the chastity of women (Buss, 2003), the mating behavior of daughters is likely to be more consequential than the mating behavior of sons. For instance, a sexual adventure can commit a daughter's parental investment to a man that her parents do not approve of, and/or damage her reputation, compromising her future chances of attracting desirable mates. Last but not least, parents cannot be certain of their relatedness to grandchildren fathered by their sons, but they can be certain about their relatedness to their grandchildren mothered by their daughters. This means that parents may have more genetic interests at stake in the mating choices of their daughters than of their sons, which in turn would motivate them to control their daughters more. Overall, as parents are more interested in the mating behavior of their daughters than of their sons, it is predicted that they will be more willing to use manipulation on the former than on the latter.\n\nWomen vs women, redux.\n\nBlaming the patriarchy (or the"}

News4's Jackie Bensen spoke with Dr. Jullette Saussy. (Published Tuesday, Feb. 9, 2016)\n\nWashington's EMS medical director and assistant fire chief has submitted her resignation in a fiery letter that cites \"emergency\" problems within the department that put citizens' lives in danger.\n\nDr. Jullette M. Saussy told News4 she will resign after just seven months on the job.\n\nShe said in a four-page letter to Mayor Muriel Bowser that a \"highly toxic\" culture and \"lack of accountability\" within the D.C. EMS system delays crews' responses to life-or-death situations.\n\n\"People are dying needlessly because we are moving too slow,\" Saussy wrote in the letter dated Jan. 29. \"Every time we send scarce resources to low-level calls, we deplete our resources and prolong response times to true emergencies.\"\n\nDC Fire Chief Reacts to Medical Director's Resignation\n\nNews4's Pat Collins has reaction from the District's fire chief to a damning letter of resignation from the department's medical director, who is stepping down after just seven months on the job. (Published Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016)\n\nSaussy cited a stabbing victim, Robert Wiggins, who died after an ambulance took nearly 20 minutes to reach him on Jan. 27.\n\n\"He suffered a potentially survivable injury, but it took more than 18 minutes for a transport ambulance to reach the 35-year-old man on 37th Street SE,\" the letter said. \"We failed that young man.\"\n\n\"Tragically, people die needlessly quite frequently and the majority of them don't make the news,\" the letter continued.\n\nD.C. Fire and EMS Chief Gregory Dean confirmed the ambulance took 18 minutes to reach Wiggins, who died four days after being attacked in an apartment.\n\n\"That's the same problem we've been having because we don't have enough resources, because they get stuck at the hospital,\" Dean said Wednesday. \"It's why we've said we're going to use a third-party provider to offset that, so we keep some unit availability.\"\n\nAs previously announced, D.C. will deploy private ambulances to help reduce some lapses in service.\n\nIn an interview with News4, Saussy, who previously ran the ambulance service in New Orleans, compared Wiggins' death to the deaths of David Rosenbaum in 2006 and Medric Cecil Mills in 2014. Each man's death was the subject of an extensive investigation into improper care by first responders. Each time, city officials promised change.\n\n\"Just like Mr. Mills and any other names we could talk about, Mr. Rosenbaum, they deserve to know that their lives are not lost in vain,\" Saussy said.\n\nShe objected to being asked to vouch for the skills of more than 700 medics to the D.C. Department of Health and the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians. She wrote that she could not ethically attest to the workers' skills when she had not been involved in their training or education, and had not met most of the workers. Her attempts to access medics had been blocked, she wrote.\n\n\"Not only can I not verify competency, there is no valid indication that they have received any form of real training or continuing education,\" she wrote.\n\nDean thanked Saussy for her service.\n\n\"We are working diligently to find an interim medical director,\" he wrote in a letter to fire and EMS crews. \"I want to assure you that all of our plans for EMS reform will continue uninterrupted.\"\n\nBowser said Wednesday that her administration is working on reforms within the fire and EMS department.\n\n\"The problems at Fire and EMS have been long documented, in terms of culture,\" she said. \"Can you turn around a culture in six months? Probably not. But we have put in place a commitment to our employees that says you're going to have the equipment that you need and you're going to have the training that we need. We think that turns around culture.\"\n\nIn the past year, the Bowser administration has held the first entry-level exam in eight years to hire new workers to the department, put a process in place to use third-party EMS providers to support FEMS and ended a 14-year lawsuit between D.C. and the largest FEMS union, spokesman Michael Czin said.\n\nEd Smith, the head of the union that represents rank-and-file EMS workers, said the union offered a number of alternatives to Saussy's plan for a comprehensive assessment of training and procedures.\n\nSaussy's last day on the job will be Friday."}

WMNF News spoke with Mark Beloch, who is homeless in Tampa. In the interview he mentions the name of a Food Not Bombs organizer, Dezeray Lyn.\n\n\"This morning I was in Gaslight Park on Ashley Drive, directly across from the Tampa Police Department. I was waiting to get something to eat from Food Not Bombs. When they pulled in, I went to get me a cup of coffee and around that time, one of the Parks and Recreation workers pulled in, came to Dezeray and told her to pack up her stuff, she had to leave. Dezeray told him that \"No. Not until everyone's fed.\" \"From there, the Parks and Recreation worker got on his phone and made calls. He was taking pictures as well. Taking photos of the table, of Dezeray, of all the homeless people in the park. That's when two Tampa Police officers pulled up, you know, walked over there. One of the officers walked to Dezeray and told her to pack it up\u2013she had to go. She asked him 'Why?' He told her 'You can't be in here.' He then asked her for her I.D. She asked him 'Why do you need my I.D.?' She cooperated, she gave him the I.D. and she asked him 'Am I under arrest? Am I being detained?' He didn't answer her. He went on his radio, made a call and checked her I.D. \"Now, while we're standing there. She's been coming to the park for 10 years, feeding. Nice organic food, vegan food, coffee, bagels, cereal. This is for people who are less fortunate.\"\n\nWhat did the police say to you about why you weren't allowed to have food that Dezeray was sharing?\n\n\"Apparently, there's a city ordinance that says: for you to feed, you have to have a permit. But, if you gotta get a permit every week to come in to feed\u2013 I don't know how long a permit lasts or if it's just for that day or that week or that month\u2013 I know this, there are other people who come out, college kids, even some of the workers who work around there come out there and give something to eat to those who don't have. \"Does the whole city have to have a permit? \"The officer came back. He held her I.D. for about 30 minutes and then he gave it to the bicycle cop. The bicycle cop came to her and said 'Oh, you're OK. I know you guys come out here every Tuesday or whatever, but, you're OK. But, there is an ordinance in effect that you have to have a permit.'\"\n\nDo they enforce this ordinance at other times?\n\n\"No, they pick and choose.\"\n\nSo, at the very end was there anyone that was still able to eat or were people turned away?\n\n\"Yes, sir. While he had her I.D., people were still walking around. People were still coming up to the table 'Hey, is there any coffee left, any bagels?' 'Aw, yeah.' She was like 'Hey, you want a bagel? You want some cereal?' Is there any coffee? There wasn't any coffee left. And then one guy walked up, he was so thirsty, he was like 'Do you have any water or milk?' She gave him a jug of water, a gallon of water. He was like 'Oh, man, thank you.' And the guy was sweating and it's chilly outside.\"\n\nFood Not Bombs says it will feed again this Saturday, in the park. Are you concerned? Is that something you might and go and get food there?\n\n\"Yes, I will. Just like I told Dezeray from Food Not Bombs: 'I'll support you, 100%. Whatever you want to do; whatever you want me to do; whatever's required: I'm there.' Because, I don't like a bully and I feel like she was bullied today. They tried to bully her. No one likes a bully, even in school. \"So, yeah. I'll be out there Saturday, getting something to eat and supporting Food Not Bombs.\"\n\nTuesday's food sharing was in Gaslight Square Park in downtown Tampa.\n\nIn 2004, Tampa Police arrested three members of Food Not Bombs for sharing food in public, but moved toward a less draconian response after public outcry.\n\nWMNF News also interviewed Steve Hegarty, public information officer for Tampa Police, who says everything would have been fine if Food Not Bombs had obtained a permit from the city.\n\n\"Yeah, we have an ordinance that says that if you're going to set up table and"}

Why?\n\nTrying to discover whether snakes evolved to slither and reevolved to produce legs, or whether there's another explanation for what appears to be double evolution, two scientists recently discovered the \"Sonic hedgehog\" gene in pythons.\n\nSonic hedgehog is a gene that is necessary for limb development, one of several genes named after the hedgehog-like spines that grow from embryos when limb development begins.\n\nThe scientist who helped carry out the snake study shows his findings in compelling imagery.\n\n\n\"It's one of the strangest body plans in vertebrates,\" University of Florida biologist Martin J. Cohn said when describing the findings.\n\nAn enhancer controls the activation of the Sonic hedgehog gene, causing it to flicker on and off. In snakes, a mutation in the enhancer keeps the gene from staying in the \"on\" position, allowing for limbs to grow.\n\n\"In lizards, Sonic hedgehog stays on and acts as the motor, driving limb development all the way down into the fingers and the toes,\" explained Cohn.\n\nIn the recent study Cohn and Francesca Leal published in Current Biology, researchers discovered Sonic hedgehog flickered to \"on\" at certain stages of python development. That's why pythons sometimes have small claws protruding from their skin: They are beginning to develop limbs.\n\nView Images A four legged snake eats a mouse Photograph courtesy Julius Cstenyi\n\nWhat that means is it's possible for the pythons of today to grow legs\u2014and it doesn't require an entire evolutionary cycle for them to do so.

Secularism generally means a belief that religion is somehow separate from reality, and should be kept separate from important human systems such as government, education, ethics, and the economic system. Proponents of secularism emphasize reason and science as more valid foundations for civilization than religion. However, in denying religion, secularists often underestimate the need in human systems for meaning and purpose, community, and a sense of humility before a greater power. American society currently faces a crisis in which a fanatical \"religious right\" has started growing in power through being paradoxically allied to a secular, corporate culture devoid of purpose and meaning. I will argue that the religious right is essentially a secular movement and is fueled by and allied to secularism. This is in contrast of the reaction that many have against the religious right, which is to reject religion and push for stronger separation of church and state. I believe that the solution to the current crisis in America lies in a restoration of true religious freedom, and and end to a society that forces secularism on people (both on its own and under the guise of \"religion\").\n\nFreedom of Religion vs. Secularism\n\nMany people fail to make a distinction between religious freedom and secularism, erroneously believing that in order to acheive religious freedom, we must purge the public sector of anything religious. Yet, many of the problems that exist in our society exist precisely because of this purging of religion, which has systematically shut out a sense of meaning and purpose from our educational system, our legal system, and our economic system. America does not have true religious freedom because many peoples' religious beliefs cannot be freely expressed through their actions in their careers, in the laws of their government, and in their choices of day-to-day life. American society has become the pinnacle of materialism and greed in the world: it is in dire need of religion to reinstill a sense of purpose in the lives of individuals and the functioning of social and governmental institutions.\n\nIndividuals can embrace religious freedom while having religion play an active role in their lives: there are many who are deeply religious, yet respect and sometimes even study and participate in religions other than the one(s) they identify with. As a society, we can also embrace these ideals: instead of separating religion from education, we can teach about different religions and encourage students to share their experiences, traditions, and beliefs with each other in order to build a greater understanding; in government, we could bring religion into the dialogue and use religious principles to impart a sense of purpose and direction to our policies. Too often the only way that religion enters into the public arena is in the form of the religious right, which I believe is neither religious nor right: instead of reacting by pushing for greater secularism (which feeds the religious right as I will argue below) we should be working to include other kinds of faith in the dialogue.\n\nSecular Religion: ChurchOne?\n\nI often jokingly talk about how I am going to start a for-profit, corporate religion named ChurchOne, named in the spirit of Bank One, Realty One, CharterOne Bank, RadioOne, and the latest corruption, ProduceOne. Yet the spirit of ChurchOne already exists. There are countless churches that exist merely as self-perpetuating social systems, devoid of a real sense of meaning, purpose, and humility before God. These are the churches where people talk about \"Accepting Jesus into your heart\" but are unable to answer in any meaningful way when you ask them what it means to believe in Jesus. These churches often serve political ends: the religious right is strongly allied with a political force that serves the secular interests of large corporations. The religious right is more about an us/them mentality than it is about a search for purpose and meaning, and the accompanying political machine certainly wants to supress any widespread discussion of purpose and meaning, for it needs to mask the fact that its sole goal is profit for a small group of privileged people. The religious right also has no humility whatsoever--they believe that they are right and all others are wrong. Although the religious right uses the language of religion, at its core it is a secular entity that is driven by politics (see language in religion). Yet the reaction that many have against the religious right is to reject religion and embrace secularism even more strongly, which ironically just fuels the religious right more.\n\nThe Solution?\n\nSecularism is easy to overcome; the problem is that up until now we have been actively embracing it instead of properly identifying it as a problem. Once we recognize the link between secularism and the religious right, and the ways in which secularism can stifle religious freedom, we can start to move from promoting secularism to offering a more constructive alternative. We do not need to embrace religion as"}

He is a very crude, sometimes obnoxious and ignorant man, but at the same time extremely sympathetic and someone you can love for his faults, as well as the situation he is in which will hopefully change his character. Cop is ironically enough, a detective. He has been demoted, and suspended from the force because he disobeyed his captains orders, and killed drug dealers before they could be brought to conventional justice, through no fault of his own of course. He wasn't fired from the force based on merit alone. He is now demoted to training a new prospect, Ernie. Ernie is wide eyed, naive with a big heart, and even bigger ambitions. He is the goody two shoes if you've ever seen one. Naturally the cops tactics don't sit right with Ernie initially, but as our story progresses he will slowly learn that sometimes, justice isn't what the law says. The Cop is specifically ordered to stay away from a recent string of serial killings. Although, that is simply not in his nature, and he slowly begins to track down the killer on his own time. As he probes the case further, and further the stakes get higher and higher, with not only his life but the lives of those around him. Cop will learn to love again after he lost his life of 20 years to a freak accident he places guilt on himself for. He will learn what the serial killer is trying to say, and attempt to stop him before he says more. Ernie will grow and learn to be a man, following the flawed cops example. Both of them are about to dive head first in a world that neither of them is fully prepared to deal with. However there is no stopping now and the story only becomes more and more explosive, and intriguing with each episode with a wonderfully colorful supporting cast to follow the adventures of as well. Our series is over the top and fun. We all well aware of the absurdity of the product, and embrace the nature of it. We have fun with what we're doing. We know that this can be considered a b-movie, and we embrace cheesiness and use it to our advantage. We play on common police movie tropes such as everyone having a mustache, the always angry police commissioner, and the rogue cop who plays by his own rules who is kicked off the force. We aren't re-inventing the wheel here, we're just putting our own spinners on it.\n\nWe've finished the first episode, watch it here:\n\nWHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP?\n\nWe are a group of young adults who all have a love of films and the filmmaking progress, and wish to have the opportunity to develop our skills while simultaneously entertaining you to the best of our ability. We simply want to be able to create without having to worry about breaking the bank, as were all getting near college age, and we don't have money to spare on a project this ambitious. Not to say that it's too much money...but it is certainly more than any of us can handle.\n\nWe filmed the pilot to a new mini-series with what budget we could scrounge up. Unfortunately all of the budget was spent on the creation of the episode. Please watch the episode and if you enjoyed it at all, please donate to help us make a second one. We all love what we do and cannot wait to do it with a higher budget. More money can propel any project's entertainment value through the roof. And we want to have access to good sets, costumes, make-up, props, locations, etc... We need your help to create the series. So if you want to watch more, help us make it.\n\nThe project we're creating is another episode in what will become a series, with an overarching plot line. These donation options are for the second episode in what we hope to be a 5-6 episode mini-series. If this endeavor proves successful, and we don't have funds left over from this venture...we will do a Kickstarter for each individual episode as it is hard to think that far ahead. The episode format is best for maximizing our budget, and resources. We want to have creative control and to not have our lack of funding as of right now. The equipment required is already owned, so this is of no concern to us.\n\nCONTENT WARNING\n\nAlthough we're young we believe firmly in humor that we think is funny.

It is a closed system in that no sand enters the glass and none leaves. The amount of sand in the glass is constant\u2014no sand is created or destroyed within the hour glass. This is the analog of the first law of thermodynamics: there is no creation or destruction of matter-energy. Although the quantity of sand in the hour glass is constant, its qualitative distribution is constantly changing: the bottom chamber is filling up and the top chamber becoming empty. This is the analog of the second law, that entropy (bottom-chamber sand) always increases. Sand in the top chamber (low entropy) is capable of doing work by falling, like water at the top of a waterfall. Sand in the bottom chamber (high entropy) has spent its capacity to do work. The hour glass cannot be turned upside down: waste energy cannot be recycled, except by spending more energy to power the recycle than would be reclaimed in the amount recycled. As explained above, we have two sources of the ultimate natural resource, the solar and the terrestrial, and our dependence has shifted from the former toward the latter. \u2014Daly and Cobb, FOR THE COMMON GOOD\n\ntable of contents\n\nSTORAGE, EMERGY AND TRANSFORMITY\n\n\"The literature on evaluation of nature is extensive, much of it reporting ways of estimating market values of the storehouses and flows in environmental systems. In recent approaches to environmental evaluation (Repetto 1992), monetary measures were sought for the storages of nature. Others have used the simple physical measures of stored resources, especially energy.\n\n\"Shown in Figure 12.1 a is a storage of environmentally generated resources. Energy sources from the left are indicated with the circular symbol. Energies from sources are used in energy transformation processes to produce the quantities stored in the tank. Following the second law, some of the energy is degraded in the process and is shown as 'used energy' leaving through the heat sink, incapable of further work. Also due to the second law the stored quantity tends to disperse, losing its concentration. It depreciates, with some of its energy passing down the depreciation pathway and out through the used energy heat sink.\n\n\"To build and maintain the storage of available resources, work requiring energy use and transformation has to be done. Work is measured by the energy that is used up, but energy of one kind cannot be regarded as equivalent to energy of another kind. For example, one joule of solar energy has a smaller ability to do work then one joule of energy contained in coal, since the coal energy is more concentrated than the solar energy. A relationship between solar and coal energy could be calculated by determining the number of joules of solar energy required to produce one joule of coal energy. The different kinds of energy on earth are hierarchically organized with many joules of energy of one kind required to generate one joule of another type. To evaluate all flows and storages on a common basis, we use solar emergy (Odum 1986; Scienceman 1987) defined as follows:\n\n\"Solar emergy is the solar energy availability used up directly and indirectly to make a service or product. Its unit is the solar emjoule.\n\n\"Although energy is conserved according to the first law, according to the second law, the ability of energy to do work is used up and cannot be reused. By definition, solar emergy is only conserved along a pathway of transformations until the ability to do work of the final energy remaining from its sources is used up (usually in interactive feedbacks).\n\n\"Solar transformity is defined as follows:\n\n\"Solar transformity is the solar emergy required to make one joule of a service or product. Its unit is solar emjoules per joule. \" [p.p. 201-203]\n\nTable 12.1.

{"id": 839, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Hey everyone Nate from Growers House here, I'm here with bill the owner of UHS Urban Horticulture Supply an indoor garden equipment manufacturer and distributor who just came out with a very unique double ended lighting fixture [Digilume 1000w Complete Fixture] that he personally brought down to us we could test it under our spectroradiometer. He actually built this in conjunction with a high end light facility. Because we do a lot of testing of other lights we wanted to see how this light compares. We did a video because this light tested very well. A little bit of the background with this light, about what it can do? Bill will talk a little about it, how did it first come about?\n\nBill- Well basically what we did we felt we needed to have a fixture that was better than the competition so the first thing we had to do was take a look at the industry leaders such as Gavita and ePapillon the two major brands of double ended lighting for the horticultural industry. We did a lot of tests to see what we could get at all different heights over the plant canopy. We set out to design a superior product specifically to other similar fixtures. The way to create demand for a brand like Digilume we have to have a product that is superior. So we took those test results at different heights and tried to determine what the benchmark was for other fixtures. Giving us a goal to beat. After designing back and forth for a few months and rigorous testing and redevelopment, we got test results that are suitable for us to put out a significant amount of PAR above the current competition.\n\nNate- So from what I understand Digilume is designed to be an indoor light as opposed to the Gavita or ePapillon which were designed for greenhouses and their footprints were designed for that use. The Digilume is designed to hang about 36 to 48 inches above the canopy as a primary lighting source for indoor applications not greenhouses\n\nBill- That's correct. We recognize the trends in other climates or parts of the world other lights work as supplemental lights for greenhouses but for north America most of the commercial setups are being designed for indoor use in a non-greenhouse environment. The funny thing is these commercial setups primary lights in indoor facilities are being outfit with lights like Gavita and ePapillon that were designed to be supplemental lights for outdoor greenhouses. It's backwards. We wanted to design a light designed specifically for indoor application.\n\nNate: I must say when I first looked at this light I thought I looked kind of peculiar. It has a long reflector that is kid of parabolic in shape. I was curious how it was going to test. And this is a high frequency ballast that goes up to 1150watts just like other standard DE fixtures these days. The cool thing is seems like the intensity and distribution came down a lot more intense and a lot more even than I would expect from a reflector like this. You mentioned this reflector can be substituted in for a Gavita fixture if you wanted to?\n\nBill- We did a few things differently with the Digilume DE. You're right you can take this fixture here with 98% reflective German aluminum the best aluminum you can get on the market. This fixture not only had better light output but can be used in universal applications in the horticultural industry with other products that are already on the market. So yes we are able to fit no only the Digilume reflector arm but also the Gavita reflector arm and a few others.\n\nNate. That's great. Price point wise you guys are able to get in there at not only the same price but a little better than the competitors out there?\n\nBill- Yes that's right we have very competitive pricing we already have pre orders for thousands of these units for mostly larger commercial setting but also medium sized commercial settings so we are able to get the prices down. And be more cost effective not crushing the price but quite a bit less than the competitors\n\nNate- that's good, I mean if it performs better and it's a lower prices it is going to well in the marketplace. I can you guys we tested this before we filmed this video and the results are really good. This is the best double ended fixture we have yet to test at our facility. Check out the results with a spectral graph and the par measurements over the 4x4 Foot print at different heights.\n\nNate- The results for the Digilume DE, it did extremely well. This unit, at center par has the highest readings we've ever recorded for an indoor growing light.\n\nComparing it to the last DE list 1000W test we did with the ACDE, Adjust a Wing, the ePapillon, a Gavita Pro and the Magnum XXXL. Compared to a Gavita light this light is throwing out more intensity over the 4x4. There"}

That fury intensified as critics slammed a letter written by Turner's father as oblivious, \"tone-deaf\" and \"impossibly offensive.\" \"His life will never be the one that he dreamed about and worked so hard to achieve,\" Dan A. Turner wrote in a letter arguing that his son should receive probation, not jail time. \"That is a steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action out of his 20 plus years of life.\" \"He will never be his happy go lucky self with that easy going personality and welcoming smile,\" the letter says, noting that the former Olympic hopeful is now a registered sex offender. In an interview with The Washington Post early Monday morning, Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen confirmed that the letter had been submitted to the court before Turner's sentencing last week and criticised the letter for reducing a brutal sexual assault to \"20 minutes of action.\" He also slammed Turner and his father for refusing to own up to the crime.\n\n\"To this day, the defendant denies what he did,\" Mr Rosen said, adding that Turner \"preyed upon\" his victim and displayed violence. Brock Turner's attorney did not return a request for comment regarding Dan Turner's letter. The controversial letter emerged three days after prosecutors released another letter, this one written by the victim, who has not been named. The two letters stand in stark contrast. While Dan Turner's has been described as myopic, the victim's has been called powerful and moving. The victim's letter begins by bluntly addressing her attacker.\n\n\"You don't know me, but you've been inside me, and that's why we're here today,\" she read in court. She then described how she decided to attend a party so she could spend time with her younger sister. \"I made silly faces, let my guard down, and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered since college,\" she said. \"The next thing I remember I was in a gurney in a hallway. I had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my hands and elbow. I thought maybe I had fallen and was in an admin office on campus. I was very calm and wondering where my sister was. A deputy explained I had been assaulted. I still remained calm, assured he was speaking to the wrong person. I knew no one at this party. When I was finally allowed to use the restroom, I pulled down the hospital pants they had given me, went to pull down my underwear, and felt nothing.\" She described in painful detail how the hospital staff documented her assault with probes and swabs, \"shots, pills, had a Nikon pointed right into my spread legs. . . . \"I wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else.\" She described Turner as a predator picking off \"the wounded antelope of the herd, completely alone and vulnerable, physically unable to fend for myself. . . .\"\n\nShe added: \"Sometimes I think, if I hadn't gone, then this never would've happened. But then I realised, it would have happened, just to somebody else. You were about to enter four years of access to drunk girls and parties, and if this is the foot you started off on, then it is right you did not continue.\" \"You do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confused anymore,\" she said of his conviction. \"You have been convicted of violating me with malicious intent, and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol. Do not talk about the sad way your life was upturned because alcohol made you do bad things.\" And yet, that is essentially the tone of Turner's father's letter. Dan Turner's letter begins with brisk reference to the sexual assault. \"First of all, let me say that Brock is absolutely devastated by the events of January 17th and 18th 2015,\" it says. \"He would do anything to turn back the hands of time and have that night to do over again. In many one-on-one conversations with Brock since that day, I can tell you that he is truly sorry for what occurred that night and for all the pain and suffering that it has caused for all those involved and impacted by that night. He has expressed true remorse for his actions on that night.\"\n\nMr Rosen said, however, that Brock Turner never accepted responsibility for the assault. Had he done so, prosecutors probably would have agreed to a sentence of less than six years. Dan Turner's letter then launches into a description of his son's \"easygoing personality\" and the \"inner strength\" that made him such a good swimmer. Dan Turner said he and his son were \"totally in awe\" of Stanford's campus, and noted with pride the school's 4 per cent acceptance rate. Turner then described his son not as a sexual predator, but as a victim. \"He excelled in school that quarter earning the top GPA for all freshmen on the swim team"}

Some stickers are free, while others are sold in 69p packs via in-app purchase.\n\nIt's Snoop's second app of 2013, following Snoop Lion Reincarnated: Track Notes App on iPad, which offered clips and background information on his latest album. He's also putting his name to a \"rhythm-fighting\" game called Way of the Dogg, which is launching on iOS, Android, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.\n\nSnoopify also 99centbrains' second artist-focused photo-sharing app of the year, following its release in April of Major Lazer's Lazergram, which took a similar approach to Snoop's app.\n\nInstagram currently has 100m monthly active users, while Twitter and Facebook are both used heavily for sharing photos. It's no surprise, then, to see stars like Snoop Dogg exploring standalone apps as a way to encourage fans to emblazon their imagery on their shots before sharing.\n\nIn fact, Snoop has made a habit of being an early adopter of new digital services and apps that might help him connect to more fans and make money, even if those partners have gone on to have mixed success.\n\nHe was on Twitter in 2008, Instagram in early 2011 and Google+ in early 2012, for example, and also became one of the first hip-hop artists in console game Rock Band in early 2009.\n\nStreetCred and feature-phone game Snoop Dogg Boxin' in 2007, JibJab in 2008; branded soundboard app Snoop Dogg's iFizzle, a \"VoiceSkin\" for TomTom GPS satnav devices and a channel on livestreaming service Ustream in 2009, are more examples of Snoop's advisors exploring new digital-media opportunities.\n\nThen came a presence on mobile community MobileStage, a selling $200k of digital merchandise for virtual worlds and blowing up a truck to promote Zynga's Mafia Wars in 2010; his own YouTube show for Samsung and hosting a room on video service Chill and a \"Snoop Pack\" of video-editing effects for the Viddy app in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, meanwhile, Snoop struck a deal with social mobile games firm Grab Games, and bagged his own stage in console game Tekken Tag Tournament. And now apps in 2013.\n\nThere's arguably more money to be made in 2013 by stars like Snoop Dogg from other kinds of apps than photo-sharing, though.\n\nWitness Trey Songz, whose Trey Songz \u2013 The Angel Network app is reportedly generating $54k a month from sales of virtual credits, which fans then spend on sending private messages, customising their profiles and bidding to \"get noticed by Trey\" by promoting those profiles on the app's \"VIP Board\".\n\nThat app is a partnership between Songz and mobile firm Handmade Mobile, which also runs the popular dating app Flirtomatic \u2013 which uses the same model of virtual credits \u2013 and launched a now-discontinued Take Me Out Flirting app for ITV as a spin-off from its Take Me Out show.\n\nMeanwhile, if Snoop's people want to sell digital stickers within apps, they might want to have a chat to the publishers of messaging apps like KakaoTalk and Line, which are hugely popular in Asia, keen to expand to the West, and include in-app stores selling virtual stickers.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The original tutorial was written by Ernesto Garc\u00eda.\n\nUICollectionView , introduced in iOS 6, has become one of the most popular UI elements among iOS developers. What makes it so attractive is the separation between the data and presentation layers, which depends upon a separate object to handle the layout. The layout is then responsible for determining the placement and visual attributes of the views.\n\nYou've likely used the default flow layout \u2014 a layout class provided by UIKit \u2014 which consists of a basic grid layout with some customizations. But you can also implement your own custom layouts to arrange the views any way you like; this is what makes the collection view so flexible and powerful.\n\nIn this UICollectionView custom layout tutorial, you'll create a layout inspired by the popular Pinterest app.\n\nIn the process, you'll learn a lot about custom layouts, how to calculate and cache layout attributes, how to handle dynamically sized cells and much more.\n\nReady to pimp-up your collection view? Read on!\n\nGetting Started\n\nDownload the starter project for this tutorial and open it in Xcode.\n\nBuild and run the project, and you'll see the following:\n\nThe app presents a gallery of photos from RWDevCon. You can browse the photos and see how much fun the attendees had while at the conference.\n\nThe gallery is built using a collection view with a standard flow layout. At first sight, it looks all right. But the layout design could certainly be improved. The photos don't completely fill the content area and long annotations end up truncated.\n\nThe overall user experience appears quite boring and static because all cells have the same size. One way to improve the design would be to create a custom layout where each cell is free to have the size that perfectly fits its needs.\n\nCreating Custom Collection View Layouts\n\nYour first step in creating a stunning collection view is to create a custom layout class for your gallery.\n\nCollection view layouts are subclasses of the abstract UICollectionViewLayout class. They define the visual attributes of every item in your collection view. The individual attributes are instances of UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes and contain the properties of each item in your collection view, such as the item's frame or transform .\n\nCreate a new file inside the Layouts group. Select Cocoa Touch Class from the iOS\\Source list. Name it PinterestLayout and make it a subclass of UICollectionViewLayout. Make sure the selected language is Swift and finally create the file.\n\nNext you'll need to configure the collection view to use your new layout.\n\nOpen Main.storyboard and select the Collection View in the Photo Stream View Controller Scene as shown below:\n\nNext, open the Attributes Inspector. Select Custom in the Layout drop-down list and select PinterestLayout in the Class drop-down list:\n\nOkay \u2014 time to see how it looks. Build and run your app:\n\nDon't panic! This is a good sign, believe it or not. This means the collection view is using your custom layout class. The cells aren't shown because the PinterestLayout class doesn't yet implement any of the methods involved in the layout process.\n\nCore Layout Process\n\nTake a moment to think about the collection view layout process, which is a collaboration between the collection view and the layout object. When the collection view needs some layout information, it asks your layout object to provide it by calling certain methods in a specific order:\n\nYour layout subclass must implement the following methods:\n\ncollectionViewContentSize : This method returns the width and height of the collection view's contents. You must override it. Then return the height and width of the entire collection view's content \u2014 not just the visible content. The collection view uses this information internally to configure its scroll view's content size.\n\n: This method returns the width and height of the collection view's contents.

These boots are a piece of history that I wear \"every day\", well not every day, but whenever I need a good pair of boots to go with one of my kilts or retro-outfits. I purchased these boots about 5-6 years ago in brand new, unissued, condition. They were still tied together with a piece of hemp twine and had the original cotton laces in them. The laces were brittle and quickly broke, so i replaced them with oiled leather laces. The only other thing I've done to the boots is to treat them with Hubbard's Boot Oil (really sticky and thick logger boot treatment). These boots are still available used, from time-to-time, through the various surplus outfits, but you don't often find them in unissued condition. These boots were copied from the original WW2, US Army, double buckle leather boots that were issued to our troops in Europe. These French copies would work great for US reproduction WW2 boots if it were not for the fact that the leather is \"inside out\". The boots have the smooth side of the leather in which is EXTREMELY comfortable and smooth when walking in them. The soles are really hard and stiff with wide open lugs that will leave black marks on any un-carpeted floors. One really cool thing about these boots is the great maker and size stamp that is inside the boot top. These boots are a size 43 and were made in 1962 . Here are a few pictures of some French Soldiers wearing these boots in Algeria back in the 1960's: Here's a picture of a US Army soldier in France during WW2, wearing the US version of the double buckle boots:"}
{"id": 853, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Ccontinuing on some of the thoughts I mentioned in my Tuesday post on the occasion of six months since my mother's passing, I wanted to explore some of these issues further in a more general way, meditating on a few related questions.\n\nI've actually gotten a couple of private notes from folks concerned that, from what they read, I was \"repressing\" my emotions regarding my mother's passing. I actually alluded to this question in my post, i.e., that some (no doubt from their own experience) have this sense that, when a parent or someone you love dies, you are \"supposed to\" break down emotionally (\"it's okay to cry,\" etc.). Some people do that, of course, and I don't see anything wrong with it, so long as it doesn't become destructive. But not everyone mourns that way. And they don't have to.\n\nPart of what's going on is probably explainable just in terms of different personalities, and of course with me, as I mentioned, I have a lot of experience with death in a professional capacity. Most people \"don't know what to do\"\u2014one hears that phrase a lot in the middle of the experience\u2014but like most clergy, I am literally trained to \"know what to do.\" I'm nothing special in this regard. This is normal. Just like I need to know how to serve at the altar, I need to know how to process mourning.\n\nThat said, I think more is probably explainable\u2014and here I am not only talking about myself\u2014in terms of a key concept in Family Systems Theory (something I have been working to learn about over the past year or so): differentiation of self. I won't go into the details (though I suggest you read the link, if you're interested), but the important thing here is to know that some families and individuals do not have a high level of emotional dependency on one another. This doesn't mean that they're independent or indifferent. It doesn't mean they don't love each other. Rather, it means that their sense of self is not inextricably bound up in another person.\n\nIn my own family (including extended family), it's been interesting to watch the different kinds of mourning for my mother. Some people are devastated. Some people are going through the loss with a lot of stability. And there's a lot in between. Usually, the most devastated ones are the ones whose emotional selves were much more intertwined with my mother's. There are a lot of reasons that could be the case, and I won't go into them, mainly to respect their privacy. But some of those reasons are completely understandable and don't mean that something is \"wrong\" with anyone. So it's normal that, if your sense of who you are has a lot of \"hooks\" built into another person, when that person is lost (or, alternatively, if he rejects you, behaves badly, etc.), then that is much more upsetting to your own emotional stability.\n\n(As an aside, I've seen this concept of high and low differentiation of self work out even in the world of blogging, which you might think would be highly differentiated by nature. It's not, though. A few bloggers I sometimes read have followings that respond in a highly emotional way\u2014they are always telling the bloggers how wonderful they are as persons. And if someone criticizes the bloggers' writing, the response to that criticism from the following is to tell the critic that they don't understand the bloggers as persons. Criticism of ideas is perceived as an attack on the person. The systems have emerged with low self-differentiation (perhaps those writers attract that sort of person), so responses are in terms of defining the other person rather than self-definition. An example of a blogging environment with higher self-differentiation is one focused on issues where commenters rarely say anything about each other as persons, whether positively or negatively. Okay, back to the subject at hand.)\n\nThe good news is that the loss of equilibrium can be an occasion for healing. And one of the beautiful things about rites of passage\u2014not just death, but also marriages, births, baptisms, moving out, etc.\u2014is that sometimes family emotional processes that have been locked into place can unlock, and the system can adapt to become more healing. People who have been out of touch can reconnect, for instance. Or sometimes people see each other in a new light. I've seen that happening in some ways in my family. I've watched it happen as a clergyman, too, since I often get inserted into those rites of passage for families.\n\nIf I had to generally analyze my family, I'd say that my father's side tends to be more self-differentiated while my mother's is somewhat less so. Neither is \"right\" or \"wrong,\" exactly, though more differentiated selves do tend to be more stable in the long run. The danger in the more differentiated families is that people can"}

Menkart gave the opening speech and said 90 percent of children's books that Teaching for Change sells at the bookstore are by or about people of color, specifically noting that the shop does not sell Limbaugh's best-selling children's book. She said the bookstore proves there is a market for these books by or about minority people, but then added that the bookstore isn't breaking even and asked the audience for support through donations.\n\nThis is what Limbaugh took issue with on his show Monday.\n\n...This is exclusionary, it's racist, it's bigoted, and it's the opposite of everything they claim to be. And it's exactly what they accuse us of being. They claim that they're tolerant. They claim they're open-minded. They claim that they are colorblind and all that. They are the most bigoted, racist people. They exclude here and exclude there and then they don't make any money and they can't figure out why. My two books are in the top five on the New York Times best-seller list, and here's a woman at a bookstore who wants to sell books, is begging people to buy 'em, proudly says that two of the books in the top five are not even available at her store, and she wants accolades for that. These people are loony. They simply are dumb. They don't have the slightest idea what they're doing. And they happen to be running the country. And I don't just mean in Washington. People like this are in charge of the public school system. People like this are teaching your kids. People like this are running day care. People like this show up at Obama's fundraisers.\n\nMenkart says that since Limbaugh's segment aired, the nonprofit has received hate calls from fans of the conservative show accusing her of being racist. Menkart tells City Desk that all independent bookstores are struggling, no matter what type of books they are selling. Teaching for Change is accepting donations for its entire organization, which provides resources for schools, parents, and children.\n\n\"It shows what we are facing,\" Menkart says. \"That Rush Limbaugh clearly feels threatened and willing to dedicate that much airspace on his show highlights the uphill battle we are facing.\"\n\nOnly 10 percent of children's books currently on the market are by or about minority people, according to Menkart. She says the Teaching for Change staff curates the books sold at its Busboys and Poets shop to reflect the diversity of the surrounding community.\n\n\"It really reflects the diversity and we're proud of it,\" she says. \"People over and over come in and say they are so happy that we carry [these books.]\n\nUPDATE: Menkart called to clarify that 90 percent of the children's books the stores sells are by or about people of color and 10 percent of children's books currently on the market are by or about people of color. The post originally stated that these statistics applied to all books."}

{"id": 861, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Up until April 2012, members of Congress and their staff were the only people in the country actually allowed to trade stocks on insider information. That was supposed to change with the passage of the STOCK (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge) Act which was signed into law by Barack Obama on April 4, 2012. But, as we all know, laws are only meaningful to the extent our legislators and bureaucracies are willing to enforce them.\n\nGiven that intro, it is with great 'shock' that we share with you the results of a Politico study which would seem to suggest that Congressional aides continue to trade on insider information on a fairly regular basis despite the existence of the STOCK Act. We guess the SEC didn't take seriously the STOCK Act's attempt to \"criminalize behavior that is normal.\"\n\nThe first such example of a \"questionable\" trade comes to us from Daniel Swanson, an aide to Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) of the Judiciary Committee...why does it not surprise us that our first example comes from Illinois? As Politico notes, Swanson made some very \"timely\" trades in Mylan late last year as he managed to dump up to $60,000 worth of stock just two days before the DOJ levied a $465 million penalty on the company for their EpiPen billing practices. Ironically, Swanson's boss worked with the DOJ on the Mylan settlement...\n\nOn Sept. 28, 2016, three members of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the Justice Department suggesting that the drug company Mylan was violating Medicaid laws. Nine days later, the Justice Department reached a massive $465 million settlement with the firm. In between, another action happened almost invisibly: A Judiciary Committee aide to Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) dropped somewhere between $4,004 and $60,000 in Mylan stock from his and his child's portfolios. If an aide had done the same thing in the executive branch, he or she could be investigated for violating federal conflict-of-interest law. But the Durbin aide's ownership of shares of Mylan, and their timely sale, are reflective of Congress' persistent refusal to crack down on stock trading by staffers, even in firms overseen by their committees.\n\n...but we're sure the timing of the trade was just a coincidence.\n\nBut it's not just Swanson, Paul Ryan's Chief of Staff has also managed to get really \"lucky\" on the timing of some trades over the years.\n\nDavid Hoppe, a fellow Wisconsin native and former Hill aide, to serve as his chief of staff. Hoppe left lobbying jobs with both his own firm, Hoppe Strategies, and the K Street powerhouse Squire Patton Boggs to work for the new speaker. After he moved back through the revolving door, Hoppe continued to trade stock in companies with interests before Congress. David Hoppe, a longtime Capitol Hill aide-turned-lobbyist, joined the speaker's office in late 2015 as Ryan became speaker of the House. Through personal accounts, Hoppe and his wife bought and sold shares in dozens of stocks while Hoppe worked at the speaker's office, including purchases of energy and pharmaceutical stocks made shortly before Congress passed bills benefiting the companies he traded. Hoppe told POLITICO he did not discuss any stock trades with his brokers while working for Ryan.\n\nAnd the list goes on and on...\n\nDiane Dewhirst, deputy chief of staff to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, disclosed her spouse's purchase of stock in two pharmaceutical companies, Astrazeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, in December 2016, shortly before Congress passed a medical research bill that benefited both companies. Meanwhile, on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which sets energy policy and is the main committee overseeing Obamacare, at least six aides have bought and sold stock in companies with interests in the work of the committee. One longtime committee aide in an oversight role bought and sold more than two dozen health care and energy stocks during 2015 and 2016 and sold his stock in Express Scripts, the prescription drug sales company, as the company came under scrutiny over its role in setting drug prices last October. On the House and Senate appropriations committees, which make broadly influential spending and policy decisions through annual government funding bills, at least 18 House aides and 14 Senate aides have bought or sold at least one stock, through their own accounts or family members'. For example, one senior House Appropriations aide working for a member focused on energy and water funding has, through various family accounts, bought and sold shares in companies including Royal Dutch Shell, Energy Transfer Partners, Dow Chemical and Emerson Electric. Another longtime aide on the committee's staff who is focused on investigations and research, which are at the heart of the committee's decision-making, holds and trades stock in companies with major interests in the committee's work, including pharmaceutical companies such as GlaxoSmithKline and energy companies such as Occidental Petroleum.\n\nOf course, proving that a Congressional aide traded on insider information"}

Petraeus's television performance was grim, tense, and hesitant. His demeanor was that of a defendant on the stand, trying to keep his stories straight.\n\nSurprisingly, for someone who has sworn to defend the Constitution in his professional career, Petraeus stated without qualification, \"I don't vote.\" He insisted that he did not support or oppose Trump, \"nor did I support or oppose any other candidate. I've truly tried to be apolitical, non-political.\"\n\nBut in fact, Petraeus's positions have been identical to Clinton's for years, possibly up to the moment last week when he entered Trump Tower for his meeting with the President-Elect. Petraeus as Secretary of State is Hillary Clinton in a better pantsuit.\n\nAnd that's why Petraeus is not just a bad choice for Secretary of State\u2014he's a bad choice for any other cabinet position. He brings too much baggage, a damaged brand, and a long history of lying. He lied to the FBI and CIA about his handling of classified documents; he lied to his wife about his mistress; he lied to Congress about Benghazi. Why should Trump's transition team assume he's telling them the truth now?\n\nPetraeus Mishandled Classified Info and Lied about It\n\nPetraeus handed over eight black binders of classified information to his mistress Paula Broadwell, risking charges of violating the Espionage Act. These were real secrets, and it was a more than just a \"mistake,\" as Petraeus would later allege. \"The Justice Department said the information, if disclosed, could have caused 'exceptionally grave damage,'\" wrote the Washington Post. \"Officials said the notebooks contained code words for secret intelligence programs, the identities of covert officers, and information about war strategy and deliberative discussions with the National Security Council.\"\n\nThat was just the start of a series of lies and coverups. Petraeus was caught lying to the FBI in the investigation. He also reportedly lied to the CIA when he resigned, claiming he had no classified materials when, in fact, those eight books of secret information were still at his home. The administration managed to keep the FBI investigation of Petraeus secret until after the 2012 election: the election was held November 6, and Petraeus's superior James Clapper was\u2014conveniently\u2014informed November 7 of Petraeus' affair. Obama was then briefed, allegedly for the first time, on November 8\u2014the day Petraeus resigned.\n\nMishandling classified information and then lying about it, and then being allowed to walk on a misdemeanor charge? It's as if the Petraeus scandal was the dress rehearsal for the FBI's handling of Hillary's private server.\n\nPetraeus Defended Middle East Clients Over the Rights of Fellow Americans\n\nPetraeus's first impulse is to silence any criticism of Islam that could upset his Middle East clients. When he was commander of CENTCOM, those clients were the Islamic nations in the CENTCOM region. Not much changed when he joined the global financial firm KKR in 2013, as a \"door opener\" to Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and everyone else he had previously courted in his official government role.\n\nBut then in December 2015, Trump suggested a temporary ban on Muslim immigration. Petraeus's Muslim clients went ballistic. As The Federalist related earlier this year, \"In December 2015, influential Dubai billionaire Khalaf Al Habtoor published an op-ed ('Ignore Trump's bigotry at your peril').\" On May 4, Habtoor called Trump \"very dangerous\" and a \"loose cannon.\" Two days later, Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal warned against Trump's effect on U.S.-Saudi relations.\n\nA week later on May 13, Petraeus made his move against Trump. He wrote a scathing op-ed for the Washington Post, expressing his concern that Muslims would be alienated by \"inflammatory political discourse that has become far too common both at home and abroad against Muslims and Islam, including proposals from various quarters for blanket discrimination against people on the basis of their religion.\"\n\nPetraeus's op-ed reached CAIR-levels of outrage, scolding \"those who flirt with hate speech against Muslims,\" \"those who demonize and denigrate Islam,\" and \"demonizing a religious faith and its adherents.\" A bravura finger-wagging performance, the op-ed also served as a timely audition for a future Clinton administration, with Petraeus warning \"It is precisely because the danger of Islamist extremism is so great that politicians here and abroad who toy with anti-Muslim bigotry must consider the effects of their rhetoric.\"\n\nThe press made sure voters knew that Petraeus's op-ed was"}

Worldwide, only Hong Kong comes close, with 22 bookshops per 100,000, followed by Madrid in a distant third with just 16 and compared to a mere 10 bookshops for every 100,000 for London.\n\nGabriela Adamo, who until recently was the president of the city's annual book fair \u2013 an event which draws over 1 million visitors each year \u2013 says Argentina's love affair with the book is related to the wave of mass immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n\nA century ago, Buenos Aires was the shining capital of one of the wealthiest countries of the world. European immigrants poured into Buenos Aires, creating a multicultural environment in which culture and the arts thrived.\n\nAt one stage Buenos Aires boasted two English-language newspapers, various German-language papers (including at one stage a pro-Nazi paper, an anti-Nazi one and a Jewish newspaper) along with a plethora of Spanish-language newspapers, magazines and literary and arts publications. \"The book as an object became a cultural symbol back then. It's something that persists today,\" said Adamo.\n\nBut contemporary economics also plays a role: books are exempt from Argentina's standard sales tax \u2013 a whopping 21% on most goods \u2013 and internet sales and electronic book readers have yet to make inroads on the local publishing market.\n\nAmazon does not have an Argentinian site and import restrictions make it a bureaucratic nightmare to purchase books from international internet sellers.\n\n\"Argentinians still prefer to come in and browse for books,\" said Antonio Dalto, business manager of the Ateneo Grand Splendid bookshop. \"We have a website for selling books, but it only draws a small percentage of readers. As a matter of fact, they seem to use it more to select titles online, but then they come to buy the actual book here at the shop.\"\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest El Ateneo in Buenos Aires. Photograph: Dosfotos/Design Pics/Corbis\n\nThat is perhaps unsurprising, considering the grandeur of the shop's setting: opened as a theatre in 1919 and converted into a giant bookstore 15 years ago, the Grand Splendid still boasts the beautiful ceiling frescoes painted by an Italian artist almost a century ago. Around 1 million customers visit it each year to browse through its gargantuan 21,000 square feet showroom, or withdraw into one of the old theatre boxes perched for a leisurely read.\n\n\"Culture is very important to the people of Buenos Aires. Even young kids read books, we see them here every day. Books for teenagers are one of our biggest sellers,\" said Dalto.\n\n\nPublishers and booksellers say that the city's book market is distinctly catholic in taste, immune to fads or fashion. \"There's a very particular kind of reader here, with wide and varied demand,\" said Adamo.\n\nArgentina is one of the most prolific book publishers in Latin America, and the number of titles published has grown steadily each year, from 16,092 in 2004 to 28,010 last year. The total number of books printed in 2014 was 123m.\n\nPublishing experts have also linked the country's love for reading to its obsession with psychoanalysis: Argentina has more psychologists per inhabitant than any other country in the world, and according to Virginia Ungar, a member of the Buenos Aires Psychoanalytical Association, the habitual introspection of therapy makes Argentinians ideal readers.\n\n\"Psychoanalysis, reading and the arts in general are all linked because they are all an inquiry into the depths of personality. Both literature and psychoanalysis work with the word,\" said Ungar, who is president-elect of the International Psychoanalytical Association founded by Sigmund Freud in 1910.\n\nIt is not only the market for new books which is thriving: Buenos Aires also has a total of 102 rare and secondhand bookshops, far outranking London with only 68 or Berlin, with only six, and only third in terms of secondhand bookshops per inhabitant after Johannesburg and Tokyo"}

See here for Jared's on Pornokitsch and here for James Smythe's.\n\nTo me, what constitutes science fiction has always been quite clear, and my numerous attempts at defining the genre have merely been a way of communicating that certainty. But what does \"essential\" mean? I found that much harder to define. Yes, I relied a lot on my favourite novels when compiling this list \u2013 I thought they were brilliant, therefore they must be essential. Except several of them I could not quite squeeze in. My favourite DG Compton novel, for example, is Synthajoy, but in yesterday's list I instead included The Continuous Katherine Mortenhoe \u2013 because I think it covers a theme more essential to a true exploration of the science fiction genre. Likewise, I wanted to include Jed Mercurio's Ascent, a novel that has been a touchstone work for my own writing for several years. But it only hints at being alternate history in its final pages, and it barely qualifies as space fiction. Oh well.\n\nWe readily agreed that graphic novels, or bandes dessin\u00e9es, were allowed. I picked the most obvious choice \u2013 see number 26 below. I'd like to have chosen Dan Dare or the Trigan Empire, but I don't think either really characterises a tradition in British sf comics \u2013 certainly not one that continues to this day. So, much as I love them, I found their inclusion hard to justify.\n\nCertainly, there were movements during the last few decades in sf which I needed to represent in my list: cyberpunk, steampunk, New Space Opera\u2026 As long as I picked one work from each, and could justify its presence, then job done. The works I chose for those subgenres are not the most obvious ones, but I think they're the most important \u2013 or I certainly believe they deserve to be. Others may disagree.\n\nAnyway, the list\u2026\n\n26 The Incal, Alejandro Jodorowsky & Moebius (1981)\n\nIn France, there is a strong sf tradition associated with comics, or bandes dessin\u00e9e. Not all of these have been translated into English \u2013 sadly. The Incal is one of the most popular bandes dessin\u00e9e, and rightly so. It is completely bonkers, beautifully drawn, and an excellent example of what the medium can do.\n\n27 Downbelow Station, CJ Cherryh (1981)\n\nCherryh has been churning out muscular hard sf since 1976, and she's still going. Somehow she has managed to stitch all these novels in to a single future history. It's an astonishing achievement. This book is perhaps her best-known, and is very much characteristic of her oeuvre.\n\n28 Native Tongue, Suzette Elgin Haden (1984)\n\nWomen-only utopias do not happen overnight \u2013 though from some of the novels which feature them you might think so. Native Tongue charts one route, starting from a near-future in which women are reduced once again to the status of chattel. The development of a women-only language, L\u00e1adan, is instrumental in overturning this situation. This novel is both linguistic sf and feminist sf.\n\n29 The Handmaid's Tale, Margaret Atwood (1985)\n\nThe scary thing about this book is that it's completely made-up but it feels like it could really happen \u2013 might be happening now, in fact. You see it in the news every day, and sometimes you have to wonder what is going through people's heads \u2013 the Young Earthers and Creationists, the congresswoman who publicly declares women should not have the vote, New Mexico recently passing a law which requires rape victims to carry pregnancies to term\u2026 I'd consider making such people read this book, but I have a horrible feeling they'd consider it utopian fiction\u2026\n\n30 Last Letters from Hav, Jan Morris (1985)\n\nHav is not a real place, though you might be fooled into thinking so as you read this novel. Very early proto-sf often couched its tall tales in the form of travel journals, but once Gernsback bootstrapped the genre into existence, as a form of sf it seemed to go into decline. A pity, if Last Letters from Hav is any indication of what it can do.\n\n31 Metrophage, Richard Kadrey (1988)\n\nSay \"cyberpunk\" and everyone immediately thinks of Neuromancer. But I'm not convinced that's an especially essential book \u2013 cyberpunk has become a lifestyle, and does it really matter which novel \u2013 arguably \u2013 booted it up into existence? What is essential, however, is the book which folded cyberpunk back into science fiction. This one. It marked the end of cyberpunk as a sf literary movement. All the"}

On the one hand you have a very familiar and aggressive early-game, but later on in the match you gain access to weightier minions like Savannah Highmane and Call of the Wild. It's in this sense that the deck archetype straddles both the aggressive and controlling playstyles of the Hunter.\n\nThe Hybrid deck was an extremely familiar sight during the early days of The Grand Tournament expansion, but it faded fairly quickly. Things have picked up for the archetype in the latter stages of the Old Gods metagame, however, and things are looking even rosier for Karazhan. As a result, it's worth reacquainting yourself with the ins and outs of this particular deck. We're certainly finding it a blast to play, and the uncertainty factor means you can really catch your opponents off-guard.\n\nThere are a couple of new Karazhan cards that add extra flavour to the Hybrid Hunter. First up is Kindly Grandmother who provides a wonderful early-game problem for your opponent to deal with. Secondly there's Barnes, who'll hopefully deliver either that first card, Savannah Highmane or Infested Wolf onto the board.\n\nIn our next guide, we've got a tried and tested Hybrid Hunter deck list for you to mess around with, along with an overview of the fundamental strategy behind playing it. After that we've got some Mulligan advice to help you get a strong start in each match, and we wrap things up with a breakdown of the most important combos you have to play with.\n\nEditor's note - September 2016: It's going to take a little while for things to settle down for Hybrid Hunter, but we feel as though the deck list we've highlighted here is a pretty dependable one. As with all of our Karazhan deck guides, we'll be revising them in the near future once we have some more metagame experience behind us.\n\nOn this page: 1.

They simply want the workers to relocate voluntarily out of shame.\"\n\nThe bigger problem, Kang said, was that the sex workers had no power to prevent the authorities setting up the cameras should the authorities push ahead with the plan with \"Cheongryang 588\" a case in point.\n\nLast year, despite fierce protests from more than 70 sex workers, about 20 cameras were set up in the red-light district in Dongdaemun, eastern Seoul, a year after the workers were told to move out.\n\n\"We learned the lesson then, and we will not let a similar incident happen this time,\" Kang said.\n\nThe NHRC's indifference was only aggravating the workers' situation, he added.\n\n\"The NHRC was only set up to meet the global standards required by international organizations such as the United Nations.

That translates to about 1 million fewer infertile women in this age group in 2010 than in 1982.\n\nLooking at only the oldest women included in the report (women ages 35 to 44), researchers also found their infertility rate decreased over the study period, from 44 percent in 1982 to 27 percent in the years between 2006 and 2010.\n\nContrary to a public perception that infertility is increasing, \"in truth, the data don't support that infertility is on the rise,\" said study researcher Anjani Chandra, a demographer at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. [11 Big Fat Pregnancy Myths]\n\nHowever, the percentage of married women who experienced difficulties becoming pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term \u2014 medically known as impaired fecundity \u2014 increased slightly over the study period, from 11 percent in 1982 to 12 percent in the years between 2006 and 2010. Rates of impaired fecundity peaked in 2002, at 15 percent.\n\nAmong all women (not just those who are married) the percentage with impaired fecundity increased from 8.4 percent in 1982 to 11 percent in the years between 2006 and 2010.\n\nWomen are more likely to experience difficulties becoming pregnant as they get older. In recent years, 11 percent of married women ages 15 to 24 had difficulty becoming pregnant, compared with 47 percent of those ages 40 to 44.\n\nChandra said more women are now having children at older ages, which increases the risk of fertility problems and fertility loss. But the availability of fertility treatments may, in part, counteract this trend, so that on the whole, infertility rates have not changed much.\n\nUse of fertility services may also lower the percentage of women who fit the definition of infertility used in the study, Chandra said. Women who experience problems becoming pregnant today may seek medical services quickly, and become pregnant before the 12-month period that would be needed to classify them as infertile, Chandra said.\n\nIt's important to note that not all women in the study who were classified as infertile may have wanted to have a child. About 40 percent of childless women with fertility problems did not intend to have a child in the future, the study found.\n\nThe report is published today (Aug. 14) by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nFollow Rachael Rettner @RachaelRettner.

They left, and by the end of the encounter, she alleges she'd been punched in the face outside the Crown Victoria, a bar just a block away, as security guards stood by indifferently. Since then, Hughes has led a one-woman social media campaign that has put the Crown Vic on the defensive.\n\nHughes tells Jezebel that around 1:30 am on Saturday, the seemingly drunk unidentified man put his hands in her hair and got in her face at a bar called Freehold. After a brief, nonviolent altercation between the man and his girlfriend and Hughes and her friends, she says the man was ejected from the bar. She and her friends left soon afterwards and began to walk towards a main thoroughfare to catch a cab.\n\nHer friends re-encountered the couple a block away on the sidewalk outside Crown Vic, a sprawling bar with a patio and a number of picnic tables out front. Hughes says it was then that she was attacked.\n\n\"He hit me in the face and then he started beating me, and my friend Vlad threw him off of me,\" she says. \"They got into this huge scuffle, they were punching each other. I was getting my mace so I sprayed his girlfriend and then I chased him down the street and sprayed him and they ran off.\"\n\nAccording to Hughes, the security guards standing outside the bar\u2014technically employees of a separate hired security firm and not the Crown Victoria\u2014were unfazed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"One of the security guards basically was like, 'You need to be careful where you're spraying that mace,\" she says. \"And I was like, 'Excuse me?' And he was like, 'Well, I could've gotten some in my eye.'\"\n\nHughes then asked for ice for her friend, to which he reportedly said, \"We don't have to do that.\" Then he brought out one of the bar's employees.\n\n\"Basically he comes out and he's like, 'Oh, so you're the one who got punched in the face? I can see it because you're really annoying.' And I said, 'Excuse me?' And he said, 'Yeah, I'm sure it happens all the time.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt that point, Hughes started filming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer friends called the police, and they waited to make a police report. All the while, Hughes alleges, the employee kept coming over to them, an occurrence she says she also got on camera.\n\n\"I just haven't posted it anywhere yet because I'm just waiting,\" she told Jezebel (before the bar had officially responded). \"I'm just slowly gonna release the deck of cards until they make an apology.\"\n\nWhen the police finally arrived, Hughes says the employee kept interrupting, telling the cop that she was exaggerating. The cops eventually told her that they thought her attacker would be easy to identify given the presence of security cameras at both bars, and his notable costume. They were able to file a police report on the street, and she and her friends took cabs home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You cannot tell women who are literally punched in front of your security guards that they deserved it and that you aren't obligated to help them because you maybe could get maced in their face when they are attacked and trying to get someone off of them,\" Hughes says now. \"That's unacceptable.\"\n\n\"I absolutely will never go to another establishment where the people who are supposed to be outside protecting people are nervous that they might get hit by mace.

{"id": 878, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Someone who has been removed (deported) from the United States cannot apply for a new immigrant visa, nonimmigrant visa, adjustment of status, or other admission to the United States without complying with certain legal restrictions. For starters, the person must wait a set amount of time (five, ten, or 20 years) before applying for reentry, or else succeed in filing for a waiver of inadmissibility.\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (I.N.A.) is the basic collection of immigration laws in the United States. I.N.A. 212 is the law defining the circumstances under which an alien may be inadmissible and the length of time an alien must wait before applying for reentry. Case law created by the immigration courts has further addressed the circumstances under which an alien may be granted a waiver of inadmissibility. Each case is considered based on its specific circumstances and some individuals will be allowed an opportunity to reenter the United States after removal while others may not.\n\nUsing Form I-212 to Request Reentry Following Removal\n\nBy filing USCIS Form I-212 (along with supporting documents and a fee), an alien can ask the U.S. government for permission to apply for entry before the required waiting time is complete. Form I-212 is called an \"Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission into the United States after Deportation or Removal.\" You will need to support your application by showing numerous factors in your favor, such as family ties in the United States, your rehabilitation after any criminal violations, your good moral character and responsibility for a family, and more before you can return to the country.\n\nAn alien who left the U.S. voluntarily and was not legally removed or deported by the U.S. government can petition to reenter the U.S. without filing Form I-212.\n\nUsing Form I-601 to Request a Waiver of Inadmissibility\n\nIf you are separately inadmissible to the U.S. (on top of the time bar based on your prior removal), you may also need to submit USCIS Form I-601 along with your application for reentry. The name of this form is the \"Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility.\" Because there are many grounds for inadmissibility, the requirements for obtaining the waiver will vary depending on the reason you were removed.\n\nWaivers Following Serious Offenses\n\nSome people have a better chance than others of receiving waivers to reenter the United States. Getting a waiver following an aggravated felony is extremely difficult. Similarly, aliens accused of terrorist activity are not likely to receive a waiver of inadmissibility.\n\nThe term \"aggravated felony\" is defined in I.N.A. \u00a7101(a)(43). Among other things, the term includes offenses such as murder, sexual abuse of a minor, rape, drug trafficking, and illicit trafficking in firearms or destructive devices. An alien who is removed for an aggravated felony will be barred from reentering the United States for twenty years (even if removed only once).\n\nWhat USCIS Considers Upon Receiving an Application for Reentry\n\nThere is no \"typical\" case for reentry, nor specific eligibility criteria you need to meet. Each case is considered based on its unique circumstances.\n\nTwo of the most important cases that establish a framework for the courts and USCIS to follow now are \"In the Matter of Lee\" and \"In the Matter of Tin.\"\n\nThe USCIS Administrative Appeals office in In the Matter of Lee, 17 I. & N. Dec. 275, 277 (Comm. 1978) held that an immigration violation alone should not be reason for an alien to be denied reentry. The Commissioner explained that the waiver program is intended to provide aliens with \"a second chance.\" The factors to be considered when deciding whether an alien should be given a second chance to enter the U.S. were outlined in the Matter of Tin, 14 I. & N. Dec. 371, 373-74 (RC 1974), as listed below:\n\nbasis for removal\n\nlength of time since the removal\n\nlength of residence in the U.S. (only LEGAL residence can be considered)\n\nmoral character of the applicant\n\napplicant's respect for law and order\n\nevidence of reformation and rehabilitation\n\nfamily responsibilities of applicant\n\ninadmissibility to the U.S. under other sections of law\n\nhardship involved to the applicant and others\n\nneed for the applicant's services in the U.S.\n\nIllegally Returning to the U.S. After Removal Is a Felony\n\nUnder federal law (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325), anyone who enters the Unites States illegally is committing a misdemeanor and can be sentenced to a fine or to six months in prison. The law accompanying \u00a7 1325 is 8 U"}

Yesterday's Statement targets the people smugglers' business model and removes the incentive to seek irregular routes to the EU, in full accordance with EU and international law.\n\nThe EU and Turkey agreed that:\n\n1) All new irregular migrants crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands as of 20 March 2016 will be returned to Turkey;\n\n2) For every Syrian being returned to Turkey from the Greek islands, another Syrian will be resettled to the EU;\n\n3) Turkey will take any necessary measures to prevent new sea or land routes for irregular migration opening from Turkey to the EU;\n\n4) Once irregular crossings between Turkey and the EU are ending or have been substantially reduced, a Voluntary Humanitarian Admission Scheme will be activated;\n\n5) The fulfilment of the visa liberalisation roadmap will be accelerated with a view to lifting the visa requirements for Turkish citizens at the latest by the end of June 2016. Turkey will take all the necessary steps to fulfil the remaining requirements;\n\n6) The EU will, in close cooperation with Turkey, further speed up the disbursement of the initially allocated \u20ac3 billion under the Facility for Refugees in Turkey. Once these resources are about to be used in full, the EU will mobilise additional funding for the Facility up to an additional \u20ac3 billion to the end of 2018;\n\n7) The EU and Turkey welcomed the ongoing work on the upgrading of the Customs Union.\n\n8) The accession process will be re-energised, with Chapter 33 to be opened during the Dutch Presidency of the Council of the European Union and preparatory work on the opening of other chapters to continue at an accelerated pace;\n\n9) The EU and Turkey will work to improve humanitarian conditions inside Syria.\n\nOn what legal basis will irregular migrants be returned from the Greek islands to Turkey?\n\nPeople who do not have a right to international protection will be immediately returned to Turkey. The legal framework for these returns is the bilateral readmission agreement between Greece and Turkey. From 1 June 2016, this will be succeeded by the EU-Turkey Readmission Agreement, following the entry into force of the provisions on readmission of third country nationals of this agreement.\n\nOn what legal basis will asylum seekers be returned from the Greek islands to Turkey?\n\nPeople who apply for asylum in Greece will have their applications treated on a case by case basis, in line with EU and international law requirements and the principle of non-refoulement. There will be individual interviews, individual assessments and rights of appeal. There will be no blanket and no automatic returns of asylum seekers.\n\nThe EU asylum rules allow Member States in certain clearly defined circumstances to declare an application \"inadmissible\", that is to say, to reject the application without examining the substance.\n\nThere are two legal possibilities that could be envisaged for declaring asylum applications inadmissible, in relation to Turkey:\n\n1) first country of asylum (Article 35 of the Asylum Procedures Directive): where the person has been already recognised as a refugee in that country or otherwise enjoys sufficient protection there;\n\n2) safe third country (Article 38 of the Asylum Procedures Directive): where the person has not already received protection in the third country but the third country can guarantee effective access to protection to the readmitted person.\n\nWhat safeguards exist for asylum seekers?\n\nAll applications need to be treated individually and due account must be paid to the situation of vulnerable groups, in particular unaccompanied minors for whom all decisions must be in their best interests.\n\nMoreover, specific attention should be given also to persons who have members of their close family in other Member States and for whom the Dublin rules should be applied.\n\nAll applicants will also be able to appeal their decision.\n\nWill asylum seekers remain in Greece during the appeal procedure?\n\nWhen applying the \"safe third country\" concept, any return decision is suspended automatically while the appeal is being treated.\n\nWhen applying the \"first country of asylum\" concept, there is a possibility to make a request to suspend the transfer while the appeal is being treated.\n\nWhere will migrants be accommodated whilst they await return?\n\nIrregular migrants may be held in closed reception centres on the Greek islands, subject to EU legislation \u2013 in particular the EU Return Directive. Asylum seekers will be accommodated in open reception centres on the Greek islands.\n\nHow can you be sure that people will be given protection in Turkey?\n\nOnly asylum seekers that will be protected in accordance with the relevant international standards and in respect of the principle of non-refoulement will be returned to Turkey.\n\nThe EU will speed up the disbursement of funds from the \u20ac3 billion Facility for Refugees in Turkey.

Inhabited by monstrous and evil creatures that shun the daylight, the Underdark teems with entire cities and nations of derro, drow, duergar, and mind flayers (illithids). It is also home to even stranger races such as aboleths, beholders, and kuo-toas, as well as slaves of just about any intelligent humanoid found on the surface.\n\nThese evil beings battle or trade with each other for resources, magic, and power, forming alliances that collapse when plots unravel or better opportunities come along. Interspersed with the warring city-states are enclaves of gnomes, svirfneblin, dwarves, and other neutral and good folk, who remain isolated or resist encroachment by malign neighbors.\n\nLife and Society\n\nThe Underdark is a harsh realm where two overwhelming drives rule: survival and the destruction of your enemies. Perpetually dark in most regions, the Underdark is filled with creatures that long ago developed darkvision or enhanced senses to compensate, often becoming intolerant of true light as a result of their adaptation. Some places are dimly lit by glowing rocks, luminous crystals, or phosphorescent moss, lichen, and fungi. Bizarre plants are common, and visitors usually find it impossible to identify which are hostile or poisonous without magic or potentially lethal experimentation. The most precious resource is fresh water, since the Underdark has no rain and inhabitants must rely on whatever filters down from the surface. Those who discover water hoard it and protect it with their lives.\n\nBecause of the scarcity of certain resources, each city often specializes in producing a few items and trading these with neighbors in peaceful times. A typical trade caravan consists of several dozen heavily armed merchants and soldiers, with two to three patrols sent forward or behind while traveling. Although the tunnels are generally silent, echoes travel far, and a skilled Underdark scout learns to recognize subtle signs of natural animals and lurking threats by their echoes alone. Wealthier cities teleport caravans to their destinations or use existing portals to speed travel, and access to a convenient portal is often the cause of lengthy wars between nearby cities. Cities that develop a reputation for killing or enslaving caravans in peacetime (as opposed to exhibiting cool hostility and rudeness, which are expected) usually find themselves cut off from valuable resources and made easy prey for aggressors.\n\nMajor Geographic Features\n\nBecause most of the Underdark has been only cursorily surveyed, and given that the largest caves are only a few miles long, few geographical features would be considered noteworthy to a surface dweller. Lakes tend to be the largest features, although the nearby stone may dip below the surface of the water, breaking it into quasi-separate regions that can only be identified as the same body of water by the most meticulous cartographer.\n\nTunnels in the Underdark extend for miles, some ballooning into caverns thousands of feet across, only to shrink to narrow spaces too small for a halfling to squeeze through. The largest cavern halls become representations of the surface in miniature, with hills, valleys, underground rivers, and lakes. In this three-dimensional environment, most races make use of the walls and ceilings of their caverns, accessing the higher levels with natural or magical flight or levitation or wall-crawling mounts such as giant spiders or certain breeds of lizards.\n\nThe Underdark is divided into three general levels. The upper Underdark is close to the. surface, has considerable interaction (trade, raids, or conquest) with surface races, and is mainly inhabited by drow, beholders, dwarves, mind flayers, svirfneblin, and - under cities -wererats. Water and food are relatively abundant, and adaptation to darkness is mild.\n\nThe inhabitants of the middle Underdark tend to see surface races as slaves. These include drow, lone aboleths, cloakers, derro, mind flayers, svirfneblin, and kuo-toas. Water and food are difficult to find.\n\nThe lower Underdark is incredibly strange, filled with alien societies and bizarre cultures, hostile to any unlike them, ruled by aboleths, cloakers, derro, and mind flayers. Food and water are very rare,"}

The dozens of entries included contact details for A-list names including former President Bill Clinton, Mick Jagger, Donald Trump, Earl Spencer, Barbara Walters, Henry Kissinger and at least three members of the Kennedy clan.\n\nCourt papers state that Rodriguez argued that he needed to keep the journal as insurance - as he feared Epstein would make him 'disappear'.\n\n"}
{"id": 883, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Cleveland regularly gets quality draft picks due to the fact that they regularly don't make the playoffs. Logic would dictate that better draft picks means better players, but for whatever reason that has not been the case for the Browns. The fact that they go through quarterbacks like KFC goes through chicken proves this simple fact.\n\nDespite all this, I think new head coach Hue Jackson could break this trend. I know its all been said before, but this guy is rebuilding the Browns into something that actually could, in a few years, win games. Not a lot of games, but more than they currently are. Of course, he has to have players in the meantime, and with that he will put efforts in to make them as great as possible. Are there any players on Cleveland's roster that could actually cause Pittsburgh some trouble out on the field?\n\nDeMario Davis (linebacker) could be one of those players. He was picked up by Cleveland from the New York Jets this offseason, and he makes sense as an acquisition. The only system he has known in his four year tenure with the NFL is very similar to that of Cleveland defensive coordinator Raymond Horton. His stats are good, with a combined 90 tackles on last season, as well as two sacks. The stats for the season before that were even better, 116 tackles and 3.5 sacks. These stats are not why I think he could be threat to Pittsburgh. The reasons why I think Davis will mean trouble for the Steelers offense are two fold. First, this guy is durable. He has played in all 64 games since he started for the Jets, and now has made the transfer to Cleveland. Something that Cleveland needs is durable players. Yes, Davis is not a pro bowl player, but he can be used to build around. The other reason for Davis actually making an impact for Cleveland is his leadership skills. This, again, means that he can be used to build around. If you have a strong leader, then the team is stronger. This natural born leader attribute of his dates back to his college days, and even led to his former coach Rex Ryan comparing him to Ray Lewis (who Rex Ryan worked with when he was with the Baltimore Ravens). His ability on the field has not shown anything to that level, but if we're talking about character and mindset, then Davis does fit the bill. If Cleveland's more recent quarterback trouble has demonstrated anything, its the importance of leadership skills and a good character.\n\nCleveland was expected to draft a quarterback early in the draft with their first pick in the draft, going second overall. But they didn't. They traded down. And their first pick fell to fifteenth overall where they picked up Corey Coleman, a wide receiver. Coleman is very talented, and could be a real weapon, even from day one, for Cleveland. He's a fast playmaker, first and foremost as he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.37 and had a 40.5 in the vertical jump. Coleman will be able to outrun, and generally outperform, most defenders physically. Of course, physical ability is not everything but considering that Pittsburgh was 30th in pass defense across the league last season, someone like that could cause some real trouble. Couple that with his ability to run routes and his productivity, Coleman could be a real issue.\n\nOf course, Coleman is going to need someone to pass to him. And I almost don't want to say this, because I can already feel the comments section blowing up at me - but I think Robert Griffin III could be productive in Cleveland. If he can tap into whatever mojo he had in his 2012 and 2013 seasons that is. If that happens, Cleveland just solved their quarterback question, and we might actually see Cleveland win games. The first issue that RGIII has is accuracy - but coach Jackson as said that RGIII has \"made tremendous strides\" and has no accuracy issues to talk of. If that is the case, maybe RGIII was not the issue when he was with the Redskins, but rather the scheme. When he came into the league, Washington was playing a lot of the read-option and teams were not sure how to cope with that. Then teams adapted. Washington's scheme became too predictable, leading to offensive failures. Another problem with RGIII is that he has sat on the bench the all of last season. He will need lots of work to hit his stride again. Hue Jackson, I believe, may be one of the few people who could actually do that for him. When Jackson was in Cincinnati from 2012 to 2015, he helped out Andy Dalton a great deal. Jackson saw how Dalton was struggling against the blitz, so he made Dalton release the ball faster. Under Gruden, Dalton was averaging 2.33 seconds until ball release, but now is at 2.23 seconds - the quickest rate in the sport today. Dalton went from a touchdown-interception ratio of 80-49 to 44-24 and his QBR went up from 49.9 to 63.6"}

Castles don't run away, this is a fact I know about castles and now you know it too.\"\n\n--Lindybeige, Youtuber\n\n\nChapter 180 \u2013 The siege of Beihai (1)\n\n\nIt began like any morning.\n\n\nThe first to catch sight of the Jin invaders were the sentry guards atop the walls of Beihai. There were now even fewer in numbers than when Huang Ming had first arrived, but they still stood vigilantly at their posts.\n\n\nThough they were mentally prepared for an emergency, the sight of thousands of horsemen swarming the horizon shook the men. Then the sound of pounding hooves thundered in the air. Faint at first, but it grew louder as the Jins approached.\n\n\nThough Beihai had seen much conflict over its long history, in reality it had only been the site of actual battle for a handful of times. When historians and storytellers talk about the different heroic 'Battle of Beihai' through the ages, they were actually referring (or dramatizing) to the various battles that were fought in the vicinity of Beihai. The defenders of Beihai in the past had always met the Jins in the field.\n\n\nTo put it simply, Beihai had not seen an actual siege for many, many years.\n\n\nBut thanks to the training regime and drills introduced by Huang Ming and the mix of veterans who remained in the city, the young soldiers quickly scrambled into action. The gongs were beaten, their alarm quickly rousing the entire city out of the morning chill.\n\n\nHuang Ming himself was already awake, and he rushed to the city wall to observe for himself. By the time he had climbed to the top, the soldiers on duty had the city gates closed and barred.\n\n\nThe sight of seeing an advancing army from atop a vantage point was awe-inspiring.

His eyes carefully scanned the encroaching invaders, his silent survey a calming influence among the nervous soldiers. They whispered about his nerves of steel; if someone as esteemed as Huang Ming was untroubled about the crisis, surely he had a plan to resolve it.\n\n\nHuang Ming roughly estimated that the Jins were at least twenty thousand in number; the majority of whom were mounted. It seemed very small for the task of capturing a city, but the Jins were taking full advantage of Beihai's lack of soldiers.\n\n\nThe fierce Jin warriors were dressed in furs and marten hats, yelling and whipping their powerful steeds into a frenzy. One could almost feel the earth shaking beneath their hooves. Eventually their screams merged into one, a ringing battlecry of 'Ala-la-la-la-la-la!' roaring in the air; curdling the blood of those who heard it.\n\n\nHuang Ming was not worried about the horsemen at all. After all, what could they do to the walls of Beihai except to inefficiently pelt the defenders with arrows from their shortbows at an awkward angle?\n\n\nHe was far more concerned with the infantry lagging behind the dust kicked up by the cavalry. Marching less glamorously on foot were the common soldiers wielding swords and thick round shields. Further behind were the baggage train: donkeys and oxen pulling fully laden wagons.\n\n\nIt was these wagons that was the focus of Huang Ming's attention. Some of the cargo were inevitably the food and fodder needed to sustain the army, but some of the animals of burden were dragging strange looking wheeled carts.\n\n\nThe soldiers of Beihai would not recognize the foreign implements, but the sight of them made Huang Ming's countenance grim.\n\n\n'Cannons\u2026'\n\n\nThe carts were carrying hollow metal tubes, and Huang Ming instantly recognized their use. They were crudely vase-shaped, somewhat stubby and short.\n\n\nFirearms in this world had yet to be developed. While fireworks were common in festivals, upscaling the power of the decorative pyrotechnics into deadly explosives was still just beyond the reach of current technology. Huang Ming knew that refined gunpowder had yet to be discovered, and he was still experimenting about the chemical properties in this world to truly develop it himself.\n\n\nBut it seemed that his enemy Avatar, the Princess of Jin; had used her ten-year headstart to her advantage.\n\n\nFortunately the cannons were still primitive. Unfortunately, it meant the Jins were also bringing along other 'traditional' siege weapons: battering rams, catapults"}

Posted on 11 June 2014 by John Fasullo Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) refers to the global surface temperature change anticipated as a result of doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. As it is tied directly to the net climate feedback, ECS is a useful aggregate measure of some aspects of forced climate change. While it is not a fully holistic metric for understanding a broad range of climate change impacts (e.g. it doesn't address the details of transient changes or changes in other aspects of the climate system such as the hydrologic cycle), ECS exists as a central focus of attention in characterizing the potential magnitude of anthropogenic climate change. Because ECS is not precisely known it is typically quantified by a \"likely range\". Multiple approaches exist for estimating the range, though important differences exist between the ranges provided by different techniques. In IPCC AR4, the likely range was estimated at 2-4.5C. In IPCC AR5, a decision was made to reduce the lower bound of this estimated range (1.5-4.5C), in light of several studies using the surface instrumental record and claiming a lower likely range. Since the submission deadline for inclusion in AR5 (July 2012), a number of important updates to the literature have occurred, including an improved evaluation of The contrasting influence of different forcing types on transient changes (aka forcing efficacy); The phenomenology of the recent hiatus in global surface warming; and The sensitivity of some of the instrumental studies to data used and base assumptions. Given this progress, it seems reasonable to revisit the decision to reduce the lower bound and ask whether the reduction remains warranted. In short, it is argued here that although IPCC's conservative and inclusive nature may have justified such a reduction at the time of the report, the evidence accumulated in recent years argues increasingly against such a change. The Challenge As outlined above there are multiple approaches for estimating Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and transient climate response (TCR). All attempts to quantify climate feedbacks, changes in the climate system that either enhance (positive feedbacks) or diminish (negative feedbacks) the change in the amount of energy entering the climate system (the planetary imbalance) as a result of some imposed forcing (e.g. increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide). To varying extents, the approaches all face common challenges, including uncertainty in observations and the need to disentangle the response of the system to carbon dioxide from the convoluting influences of internal variability and responses to other forcing, such as due to changes in aerosols, solar intensity, and the concentration of other trace gases. It is known that sensitivity estimates derived from both the instrumental and paleo records entail considerable uncertainty arising from such effects (1, 2). For some approaches, uncertainty in observations is also a primary impediment. Efforts to estimate climate sensitivity from paleoclimate records are a good example. While benefiting from the large climate signals that can occur over millennia, these approaches face the additional challenge of a proxy record that contains major uncertainty (2). Nevertheless, the paleo record provides a vital perspective for evaluating the slowest climate feedbacks. General circulation models (GCMs) offer a uniquely physical approach for estimating ECS and TCR and readily allow for controlled experimentation, yet their representations of key processes is often lacking (also for example the interaction of aerosols with clouds) and some processes, particularly those acting on low frequency timescales or for which observations are generally unavailable, contain additional uncertainty. Climatological constraint approaches attempt to relate the spread in these uncertainties across GCMs for some simulated field to a key physical feedback or basic model sensitivity. This approach has led to the developing subject of 'emergent constraints' (3,4). Challenges for the approach include the difficulty of establishing statistical confidence in identified relationships, due to a lack of independence across GCMs, and the need to firmly establish a physical basis for why a climatological constraint should act as an indicator of future change. The degree of these challenges may relate to how strongly a given field is tied to surface temperature, as useful insight has been gained for some fields (e.g. snow cover and water vapor; 3,5) but not others (clouds; 6). The relevance of perturbation studies to climate change are limited by the degree to which they can serve as analogues to climate change, the certainty with which their forcing can be known, and the potentially complex and poorly understood interactions between that forcing and nature (e.g. clouds). So-called combined approaches incorporate two or more of the above methods in an attempt to leverage the strengths of each, but in doing so are also susceptible to their weaknesses. Broadening the discussion to address TCR increases the range of relevant processes to include those governing the rate of heat uptake by various reservoirs, particularly the ocean. To some extent, the distinctions between ECS estimation methods are artificial. All GCMs have used the instrumental record to select model"}

You've already ponied up for your season pass or your mid-winter escape flight to Denver or your chunk of the cabin share you'll be splitting with eight friends (plus the twitchy guy from ad sales). You desperately need a new snowboard, but your budget is static, so you'll have to scan for a flash sale or discount code or go virtual dumpster diving through your email inbox cluttered with offers.\n\nBut what if you could name a reasonable price\u2013say, 20% less than retail\u2013and buy the snowboard of your dreams now from a willing retailer who'd just as soon sell it off at the beginning of the season as at the end? That's the premise behind Buystand, an online marketplace for outdoor, fitness, and active apparel and gear that allows shoppers to set their preferred price and retailers to match it.\n\nWith its newly launched beta site, the Durham-based company aims to prove that a name-your-price platform can work.\n\n\"It helps people get the products that they want today instead of having to wait for them to go on some flash deal site,\" says Buystand CEO Joe Davy, who founded big data analytics provider EvoApp.\n\nPaying an agreeable price now instead of waiting for sales and deals to come along makes obvious sense for shoppers. But Buystand is banking on its appeal for retailers, as well.\n\n\"You sell more sooner, you make more money, it's better for your bottom line and it clears your inventory faster,\" Davy says of the ways retailers stand to benefit from making inventory available on his company's platform.\n\nHere's how it works: Once on the site built by a team and advisory board that includes principals drawn from the retail, finance, and big data worlds, shoppers search for products from brands such as Burton, Vans, Puma, Merrell, and Salomon, among others. For items they want, shoppers can designate a price they'd be willing to pay. Buystand then trolls its inventory and either matches the shopper with a retailer willing to sell the item at that price or rejects the offer if no match is available. To prevent the inevitable attempts at gaming the system and encourage shoppers to propose realistic prices, Buystand only allows site users to make three offers on any one item within a 48-hour time period and actively monitors offers made for suspicious activity."}

It will be his first public engagement since the scandal broke on 2 January.\n\nThe prince and his aides are considering whether to invite TV cameras into the event where he is scheduled to make a speech about British entrepreneurship.\n\nAides believe allowing in cameras would show he was not being derailed from carrying on business as usual by the scandal. They are also understood to be considering whether he should allude to the denials his office has made in a bid to move on from the Epstein affair.\n\nFor more than two weeks, the prince and his advisers have been wrestling with how to handle what they have described as \"lurid and deeply personal\" allegations. It is understood to be very unlikely that he would directly reference Roberts or use language such as \"sexual relations\" in any statement. Instead, he is thought to be considering a form of words that would acknowledge the story, underline his position of robust denial and express his desire to move on.\n\nBuckingham Palace declined to comment on speculation about what he might or might not say. A spokeswoman said: \"The media arrangements for the duke's visit to Davos have not been determined as yet.\"\n\nThe former Home Office minister, Norman Baker, last week warned that Prince Andrew's attendance at Davos could damage British interests even though he is not an official trade envoy, a position he stood down from in 2011.\n\n\"Clearly he has been linked with Mr Epstein in an unhelpful way,\" the Liberal Democrat MP said. \"He is a member of the royal family, he is hosting a reception, and the small print may say he is there unofficially but that is not the way he will be received.\"\n\nSir Digby Jones, former director general of the CBI and trade minister under Gordon Brown's Labour government, defended the prince's attendance, saying he was \"innocent until proven guilty\"."}

Candidates now know a single billionaire can make or break their fortunes\u2014as they saw in 2012, when mega-donors Sheldon Adelson and Foster Friess propped up the candidacies of Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum.\n\n\"You may want to just wear logos if you're running for president: 'sponsored by so-and-so.' I mean it's going to get to be like NASCAR where everybody should put logos on your suit,\" said Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who, of course, has a super PAC dedicated to reelecting him this year.\n\n\"Basically, if you can get an ideologically aligned rich person who believes in you ... and they want to be a player in politics, you can keep a campaign going as long as the guy's willing to write checks,\" Graham said. \"Which changes everything.\"\n\nGOP political fundraisers and strategists said that Walker, Cruz, Paul, and Christie have been among the most active and consistently aggressive in nationwide donor outreach in the last year. It is a matter of supply and demand: There are a lot of GOP presidential hopefuls and not so many moguls with a history of investing in political campaigns.\n\n\"There are a very few number of major finance bundlers and donors that can swing elections,\" said Jim Lee, a national finance cochairman of Texas Governor Rick Perry's 2012 presidential campaign. \"You're really talking about less than 400 or 500 people in the country who, including bundling, can account for 80 percent of the money. It's a very narrow universe.\"\n\nThe Ricketts family\u2014including Joe Ricketts, founder of TD Ameritrade, and his politically active son, Todd\u2014is in that universe. Among those GOP politicians who have found time to meet with the Ricketts family in the last year, according to a person close to the family: Christie, Cruz, Paul, Walker, 2012 vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.\n\nOne event that is penciled into many 2016 aspirants' calendars is the March leadership meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition, a gathering of some of the wealthiest GOP donors in the nation. The group's board includes Republican rainmakers such as Adelson, investor Elliott Broidy, hedge-fund manager Paul Singer, and Wayne Berman of the Blackstone Group, among many others. The gathering is held at The Venetian, Adelson's Las Vegas hotel. Among the expected attendees: Bush, Christie, Walker, and Ohio Governor John Kasich.\n\n\"It's like the early bird always gets the worm. The early courtship usually pays off,\" said Ken Duberstein, a former chief of staff to President Reagan and current chairman of the Duberstein Group, one of Washington's leading lobbying firms. \"People like being cultivated, being reached out to, flattered.\"\n\nSo there was Friess, Santorum's biggest backer in 2012, attending the State of the Union as Ted Cruz's guest."}
{"id": 914, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "8-1 Network Security\n\nHow to Approach Network Security\n\nWhile the Internet and networks are growing rapidly, they are also becoming more complex and mission critical. This brings new challenges to the folks who run and manage today's networks. There has been an integration of network infrastructure that now supports voice, video, and data but at the same time new security concerns are also introduced.\n\nAs a matter of fact, no computer system in the world can be completely secure no matter how good the security measures are. Probably the only way to fully secure a computer is to isolate it completely, restricting all physical and virtual access to it. Such a system would not be connected to any network and would probably be stored in a secured vault somewhere with no physical access. Though this compuer system would be completely secure, it would also be completely useless. Usefulness of computers stems from the ability to connect to them and use the resources offered by them. So, the goal of network security is to provide continued access to those resources and, at the same time, preventing any un-authorized or malicious activity from taking place.\n\nCisco IOS software running on Cisco routers has several built-in security tools that can be used as part of a good overall security strategy. Probably the most important security tool in Cisco IOS software are access control lists (ACL). ACLs can be used to define rules to prevent some packets from flowing through the network. In this chapter, you will learn how you can protect the posterior of your network by deterring the most common threats with features available in Cisco IOS itself.\n\nCisco also produces an array of specialized security appliances such as the Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) that companies can use for securing their networks.\n\nThe CIA Model\n\nA security model is a framework that that provides guiding principles to make systems secure also meeting industry best practices and regulations. A widely applicable model of network security is the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad. CIA is more like a set of three guiding principles that can be used to secure systems. A breach of any of these three principles can have security consequences.\n\nFigure 8-5 CIA Security Model\n\nConfidentiality\n\nConfidentiality means preventing sensitive information from being seen by anyone who is not authorized to see it. It is the capability to ensure that the required level of secrecy is enforced and information is concealed from unauthorized users. Infromation is a very valuable asset and keeping sensitive information secure is critical for enterprises. That's why confidentiality is the aspect of security that comes under attack most often by those who want to steal information for their own interests. Encryption is a common technique used to ensure confidentiality of data transferred from one computer to another. For example, when a user is performing an online banking transaction, sensitive information such as account statements, credit card numbers, and passwords must remain protected. Encryption techniques ensure that information is not seen as it is being sent back and forth between the user's computer and the online bank.\n\nIntegrity\n\nIntegrity prevents any unauthorized modification of data to make sure information stays accurate. If your data has integrity, you can be sure that it is the actual unchanged representation of the original information and hence can be trusted. A commond type of security attack that compromises the integrity of data is the man-in-the-middle attack. In this kind of attack, the attacker intercepts data as it is in transit and makes changes to it without letting the two communicating entities realize that.\n\nAvailability\n\nAvailability prevents the loss of access to information and resources and ensure that they are ready for use when they are needed. It is a must to make sure that information is readily available at all times so that requests by authorized users could be fulfilled whenever they come. Denial of service (DoS) is one of several types of security attacks that attempts to prevent legitimate access to information and resources hence compromising the availability of affected systems.\n\nTable 8-1 CIA Model\n\nGoal Defined Example Methodology Availability Keeping your network services up and running DoS Attacks Auto patch updatesRate limiting Integrity Prevent data modification Man in the Middle Attack Hashing Confidentiality Secure Data from eavesdropping Packet capture and replaying Encryption\n\nThe Secured Enterprise Network\n\nIn a medium to large enterprise, the typical secured network is built around a recipe of a perimeter router, a firewall device, and an internal router.\n\nPerimeter Router The perimeter router is the border crossing or the demarcation point between enterprise network resources and the public network, such as the Internet. Therefore, traffic originating from the outside destined for the trusted network or the DMZ must transit through the perimeter router. This router should provide basic security and traffic filtering for both the DMZ and the trusted network.\n\nFirewall The firewall can be a router running the Cisco IOS firewall feature set or a sepcialized device like the Cisco Adaptive Security Applinace (ASA).

Doooo it.\" -- my brain, probably\n\nTharja grieves in a way that catches Chrom between the ribs like a knife.\n\nChapter Text\n\nIn his rooms -- their room -- there's a familiar face.\n\nAt first he thinks he's dreaming, and then perhaps that he's dead. Then, when she does not vanish when he blinks, he thinks that maybe his time has come, and all of his convictions have been answered. She's back, she's back, she's finally back.\n\nShe stands at the window with her back to him, silky-haired and one hand on her hip, and it's her, he knows it is, he knows it.\n\n\"Ada!\" he exclaims.\n\nShe looks at him over her shoulder with disdain.\n\nDisdain?\n\n\"I didn't think you'd be back here so soon,\" she says, in a voice that is not at all his wife's.\n\nThe surge of joy dies almost as soon as it arrived. A million thoughts rush through his head, each more reckless than the last. If not Ada, then Grima, but Grima is dead and\u2013\u2013\n\nShe's wearing familiar robes, but they're robes which are not her own. Ada has always cloaked herself in black and gold and purple, too, but never the revealing sheerness of a sorceress's dress, never exposed navel and high-cut thong. Ada was -- is -- always so conservative. Ada drapes herself in fabrics like she's perpetually cold, for utility, for whatever might let her swing a sword or mount a horse just a little bit faster.\n\n\"Tharja?\" he says, feeling his heart sink like a stone.\n\n\"Got in one,\" she drawls.\n\nHe has a million questions, the first of which she answers on her own.\n\n\"I'm not doing this for you, you know,\" Tharja says, but it comes out almost in Ada's voice -- it is her voice, certainly, but not a tone that Chrom's ever heard Ada use. \"I bet you'd like that, but I'm doing this for me.\"\n\nOf course she's doing it for herself. If Chrom's being honest, Tharja has only ever had two whims, and that's whatever she wanted and whatever Ada wanted. For the most part, the two things are one and the same, no matter how rarely Ada capitulated. Tharja could always want what Ada wanted, after all.\n\nWants, he tells himself. She's not dead.\n\nIt's easier to tell himself that when he's looking at her, all long-bodied and pale, dressed in the sheer black and gold of Plegian sorceress robes. He's never seen her in that before.\n\nNever seen Ada in them, that is.\n\nHe has seen Tharja in them, and this is Tharja, even if she looks like Ada, right down to the slope of her eyes and the fineness of her collarbone.\n\n\"Why?\" he asks her, because that's all he can say. He hasn't seen her face in so long, and seeing it again plucks at his heartstrings so deliberately that it's hard not to be angry.\n\n\"Because I can,\" she says. Tharja's whims, as always. \"I miss her.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to put up with this,\" Chrom replies, testily, but he can't take her eyes off her. She looks down at him imperiously, again nothing he's ever seen out of Ada, but it's still her face, the bow of her mouth and the ridge of her cheekbones. \"You have to stop this now or... or you're going to have to leave. I will send you away, Tharja, I will have you out of this castle by nightfall.\"\n\nTharja stares down at him with Ada's grey eyes.\n\n\"But doesn't it make you happy, in a way?\" Tharja asks. \"To see her face again?\"\n\nChrom doesn't want to give her the satisfaction of an answer, so he turns away.\n\n\"You can admit it, you know,\" Tharja says. \"That's the point of dark magic. It's meant to touch your emotions, right where they're most raw. That's why it works so well.\"\n\n\"It's your magic,\" Chrom says. \"Not mine.\"\n\n\"But you only see it as well as I do because you miss her as much as I do,\" Tharja says.\n\nShe's watching him.

I think this is absolutely the best consumer virtual reality headset ever made. It's relatively lightweight, works great, and should usher in a widespread acknowledgement of VR as a viable media type. But the current device will be remembered as the Apple Newton of VR \u2013 the first break-through product, but unfortunately the first massive failure.\n\nWhy? For the same reason 3D glasses just didn't make it at home. It's simply too big, too bulky, too limited and too ugly to appeal to more than hard-core geeks.\n\nLet's face it. There are few things more ridiculous than someone jacked into an Oculus Rift, exploring their very own world. The outsized head gear makes you look like an alien playing pin the tail on the donkey. And when you're deep into it, your head flops around like Shermy at a Peanuts dance party, hepped up on Special K. This is not attractive, people.\n\nBut it's not just how utterly absurd you look when \"rifting\". The device just isn't transformational enough to replace how we currently navigate virtual worlds \u2013 primarily through game consoles and big-screen TVs.\n\nEvery new technology needs to have a net innovation score of Plus Two. In other words, it needs to deliver true substantial improvement on what's come before on at least two separate dimensions. Take a step back somewhere, and you need three super breakthroughs. Two new limitations mean you need four \"Ohmygawd\" features. And so on and so forth.\n\nThink about the TiVo for a minute. It was a marginal success, even though it contained three critical breakthroughs \u2013 pause live TV, random access to everything you've recorded, and the ability to schedule and group recordings days, weeks and months in advance. That was so far above both traditional linear television and the VCRs we used to use to record shows. Even better, you could actually skip commercials! Make that four breakthroughs.\n\nUnfortunately it was (at least in the early days) horrifically hard to set up, and required a kludge (in most cases) for the TiVo to control your cable or satellite set top box. Net of 2. And the 30 second skip feature required a secret code to activate, which probably ended up giving it a 1.5\n\nMP3 players went through the same growing pains. They crushed the Walkman by giving you random access to hundreds of hours of music, but unfortunately it was a pain to encode and load music on those early players. Plus they were bigger and more fragile than a portable cassette player. Digital music players didn't truly win until Apple created iTunes (to make it easy to rip and load music), and combined a better interface, smaller form factor and longer battery life into the first iPod.\n\nOculus VR certainly provides an amazingly transformational experience. But that's about it. On the downside, the device is bulky and hard to wear for a long time, image quality is far lower than our TVs, and you look like a dork when you wear it. Heck, there's even a ghetto version invented by Google, called (and made out of) cardboard that slaps onto your phone and works almost as well.\n\nSo the Oculus is doomed \u2013 just like that other former darling of wearable computers, Google Glass. Whining of Glassholes aside, this product didn't deliver enough utility to overwhelm its well documented limitations. But the biggest problem from my perspective was the lack of innovation. All Google did was miniaturize one of the biggest technology failures of 2002 \u2013 the Xybernaut Poma, which coincidentally anchored a massive stock fraud. How disappointing.\n\nIn the end, consumers will turn away from things that make them look goofy, including both the Oculus Rift and Google Glass. But there's good news out there too, because both of these products \u2013 like the Apple Newton \u2013 have inspired a new group of developers who will solve these problems. And we're beginning to see them in the wild.\n\nFirst, Microsoft's new HoloLens actually does what I thought Google Glass would. Instead of hijacking your field of view with a disconnected computer screen, the HoloLens layers the virtual world seamlessly on top of the real world. Now that's a breakthrough. It's a heads up display for the entire world, and I can easily see it linking together maps, LinkedIn data, Facebook, video games and a wide variety of contextually relevant images and data together as you walk and drive around the real world. Rather than isolating the virtual world into a stamp-sized screen, it layers and adds context to the places we already inhabit.\n\nOK, on the downside it's still clumsy and clunky \u2013 albeit less so than the Oculus. It's ugly too \u2013 Glass is downright stylish by comparison. But by integrating virtual and actual"}

The quarters were released in the same order that the states ratified the Constitution or were admitted into the Union, and that year is marked under each state's name. Here's how each state decided what to put on its quarter.\n\n1. Alabama\n\nThe design of this coin which, in 2003, was the 22nd to be released, shows Alabama native Helen Keller reading a braille book. The design was one of many submitted by Alabama schoolchildren as part of a statewide competition with the theme \"Education: Link to the Past, Gateway to the Future.\" The initial favorite depicted a historical timeline of the state, but it was deemed too intricate to fit on the face of a quarter.\n\nThe image of Keller was chosen by her living relatives and she is identified on the coin both in English and in braille. She is flanked on either side by southern longleaf pine branches (Alabama's official state tree) and camellias (Alabama's official state flower) while a banner below reads: Spirit of Courage.\n\n2. Alaska\n\nReleased in 2008, Alaska's quarter was the second-to-last to debut. The image is of a grizzly bear with a salmon in its mouth, a fitting symbol considering that over 98% of the grizzly population in the country lives in Alaska. The inscription reads \"The Great Land,\" which beat out other possibilities like \"The Last Frontier,\" \"North to the Future,\" and \"Land of the Midnight Sun\" (taken together, these sound like the titles of a dystopian young adult trilogy).\n\nThe Alaska Commemorative Coin Commission invited citizens to submit ideas for the quarter and received over 850 suggestions. A final four were forwarded to the US Mint for consideration, and those designs included a polar bear, a dog musher, and a gold panner.\n\n3. Arizona\n\nAs the last state in the contiguous U.S. to be added to the Union, Arizona was number 48 in coin release order. After soliciting suggestions from citizens, 4,200 ideas were whittled down to five narratives that were sent to the Mint for approval and artistic rendering. The five final images were then subjected to a statewide online poll. The final selection features a (relatively) sprawling view of the Grand Canyon with a saguaro cactus in the foreground. The banner declares it the \"Grand Canyon State.\" Three of the four other finalists also featured the natural wonder.\n\n4. Arkansas\n\nThe 25th quarter design to be released celebrates Arkansas as the \"Natural State.\" A total of 9,320 designs were submitted for consideration and the field was cut to three\u2014all of which chose to focus on the abundant natural resources in the state. After the final three designs were modified by the US Mint, Governor Mike Huckabee chose a winner. A giant diamond floats above a serene lake and is flanked by rice stalks and a mallard duck. The diamond represents Arkansas' popular Crater of Diamonds State Park, home to the only diamond mine open to the public. The rice represents (what else) the prolific rice production in the state, while the mallard attracts hunters from across the nation.\n\n5. California\n\nThe 31st quarter in the series commemorates California conservationist John Muir's work with Yosemite Park and the Sierra Club, of which he was the first president. The Scottish-born Muir is shown gazing at the granite \"Half Dome,\" which is one of the most recognizable features of Yosemite Valley. Both Muir and the Valley are named on the face of the coin.\n\nThe submissions from a statewide contest for the quarter design were narrowed to a field of 20 by a specially appointed California State Quarter Commission. From there, then-Governor Gray Davis chose five to send to the Mint: the winning selection as well as ones based around the themes \"Waves and Sun,\" \"Gold Miner,\" \"Golden Gate Bridge,\" and \"Giant Sequoia.\"\n\n6. Colorado\n\nColorado was the 38th state to join the Union and thus the 38th quarter in the series. The commemorative design shows a sweeping view of the Rocky Mountains with a swatch of evergreen trees in the foreground and a banner proclaiming the state \"Colorful Colorado.\" The four other designs that were sent the US Mint for consideration included depictions of Mesa Verde National Park, the 10th Mountain Division, a prospector's pick and shovel with the Colorado Gold Rush slogan \"Pikes Peak or Bust,\" and a decorative 'C' in honor of Colorado's nickname, the Centennial State, which it earned for gaining statehood less than one month after the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\n\n7. Connecticut\n\nConnecticut's quarter, the fifth in the series, honors an early act of American patriotism and bravery with a depiction of the Charter Oak. The"}

The two areas where it wants to improve, turnovers and fouls, are what have produced the two losses on its 3-2 record.\n\nControlling what it can, capitalizing on its strengths and minimizing its mistakes can be just the recipe for earning a road victory against the Chicago Bulls on Thursday night and getting back to winning ways.\n\nAfter losses to the Houston Rockets and Toronto Raptors where the Thunder held leads in the fourth quarter, the team utilized the wide-angled lens perspective to how it is currently playing. It is still early in the season, and while it is trying to smooth out any rough edges from the introduction of an adjusted style of playing on offense and defense, the Thunder recognizes that the process to becoming the team it wants to be will be a continued one.\n\nIn the meantime while the wrinkles are being ironed out, Head Coach Billy Donovan's squad will simply try to control what is in their hands on every possession \u2013 its energy.

Where the Thunder can look to take advantage of Chicago is on the offensive glass, where it currently snags 14.2 of its own misses per game compared to the Bulls' meager 7.0 offensive rebounds per game.\n\nOn the other end of the floor, the Thunder will have to be vigilant against the Bulls' offense, which is playing quite differently than in seasons past. Chicago currently ranks fifth in the NBA, two spots behind the Thunder, in three-point field goal percentage at a 38.6 percent clip.\n\n\"They have a different offense right now,\" guard Anthony Morrow said. \"We just have to do what we've been doing defensively and attack the things that have been hurting us, which are turnovers and fouls. If we do those things, we'll be fine.\"\n\n\"They have a new high-powered offense and they space the floor for their guys,\" forward Kevin Durant said. \"We have our work cut out for us on the road, we just have to rely on each other.\"\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nBroadcast Information\n\nTip-Off: 7:00 p.m. CT\n\nTelevision: TNT\n\nRadio: Thunder Radio Network, WWLS the Sports Animal"}

{"id": 930, "ended": true, "length": 836, "text": "Spatial Subdivision techniques are essential in almost all areas of computer graphics, and are very popular in both 2D and 3D digital cartography. In 3D Tiles, they simplify rendering by grouping large amounts of geometry into tiles that are likely to be visible at the same time and provide a hierarchy so not every tile has to be checked when determining what should be streamed and rendered.\n\nSpatial data structures form the backbone of 3D Tiles. They all have one thing in common: child tiles have geometry that fit within their parent tile's bounding volume. Here's a quick algorithm for building a 2D quadtree that conforms to this rule:\n\nstart with a bounding box that encompasses all the geometry split that bounding box evenly into child quads for each child quad, repeat until you have n triangles per quad.\n\nHere's an interactive demo built on this algorithm. Areas with darker blue are \"deeper\" in the tree.\n\nleft click to add points, left click on a point to remove it\n\nhold right click to wipe the tree\n\nhold left click to wipe the tree and immediately scatter some random points\n\nA standard quadtree is a wonderful way to partition relatively uniform data, such as the random points in this demo. It's also why quadtrees work very well for raster data, which take up the entire space. However, when geometry is relatively sparse, the tree easily becomes inefficient. Take this quadtree, for example:\n\nThe quadtree is pretty unbalanced, going deeper in the top right than in the bottom left. If we had simplified geometry in each non-leaf tile for Hierarchical Level Of Detail (HLOD), we would have a chain of simplifications to go through before reaching the original geometry in the top right. In addition, the tiles in the top right quadrant mostly encompass the same thing, with useful distinction only on the smallest tiles - so each simplification in that chain would essentially be of the same thing, removing one of the advantages of HLOD. Finally, there are a lot of tiles that cover much more area than their actual geometry, which makes frustum culling much less effective.\n\nIn these cases, we benefit from picking each tile's bounding box and splitting the bounding box into child quads differently. For example, one easy change is to use an initial bounding box that only encompasses the given geometry and then pick how we subdivide the children based on density. Performing both techniques recursively leads to much better results. Right click on the demos above to switch between a traditional quadtree and our density-based non-uniform quadtree on the same set of points.\n\nIf we were to draw out the tileset for the two subdivisions, they might look something like this:\n\nThe non-uniform tileset on the right has a more balanced, shallower tree with tighter bounding volumes, all of which lead to better rendering efficiency.\n\nOther algorithms may be even better suited for getting around the efficiency problems of uniform quadtrees. A k-d tree, for example, can be extremely well balanced if constructed roughly as follows:\n\ncompute the \"center\" along one axis of all geometry in a region divide the region into two child regions based on that center repeat for each child region, rotating the axis for subdivision\n\nSince a k-d tree always splits the geometry in a region in half, the resulting tree can be extremely well balanced, depending on the criterion for \"center\". However, since each split can only produce two new tiles instead of the quadtree's 4 or an octree's 8, k-d trees tend to become very deep for large datasets.\n\nThe big takeaway here is that there is rarely a perfect \"one size fits all\" spatial data structure algorithm. Fortunately, the flexibility written into the 3D Tiles specification allows users to implement virtually any 2D or 3D spatial data structure - users can even mix and match subdivision strategies within a tileset to suit different types of data."}

Twenty-six years later, one of those friends is still at it.\n\n\"Today is the 26th anniversary of Fluke,\" says Matthew Thompson on July 18 from his home in Phoenix.\n\nThe homemade publication -- now with 14 issues published in all -- is what he created with Jason White and Steve Schmidt, whom he met at Lakewood Junior High School and Northeast High School, respectively, to document the nascent central Arkansas punk scene.\n\nOver the past two editions of Fluke, Thompson has taken a look back at the early '90s Little Rock punk underground. He has also gathered 18 unreleased demos by bands like Econochrist, Trusty, Step by Step, Quisp, 12ft6 and others from that era for the new audiocassette-only release Very Little Rock: A Punk Compilation From Little Rock Arkansas 1988-1992.\n\nThe tape's title was inspired by a quote from former Black Flag singer Henry Rollins.\n\n\"There's very little rock in Little Rock,\" Rollins said dismissively in 1987, a year after his band performed for the only time in the state capital. Thompson used the play on words to emphasize the Little Rock-centric nature of the collection.\n\n\"All of those songs are from demo tapes,\" Thompson says. \"Bands would record demos and pass them around. Most of those songs have never been released, so I released them.\"\n\nHe sees the collection, which he sells for $3, as an extension of the latest issue of Fluke.\n\nBut why cassette only?\n\n\"Back then, I always had my favorite cassette in my pocket,\" Thompson, 45, says of his punk rock youth.\n\n\"If I went to someone's house or got in their car, I could say, 'Check this out.' So I wanted to throw it back to that, to where these demo tapes came from, because that's all they were, tapes.\"\n\nSCENE REPORTS\n\nSelf-published 'zines have been around since the 1930s and were first made by fans of science fiction and fantasy.\n\nBy the '70s and '80s, 'zines were a crucial side-effect that cropped up from regional punk scenes. Inspired by punk rock's do-it-yourself ethos, creative types wrote reviews, conducted interviews, made comic strips and other art then compiled it all into cleverly copied and pasted booklets as documentation of themselves and their environment.\n\n\"That was how we found out about other scenes,\" Thompson says.\n\nMaximumrockandroll, the San Francisco-based, low-budget punk rock magazine/bible, also went a long way in connecting kids from disparate parts of the country.\n\n\"People would contribute scene reports to Maximumrockandroll, and you could learn what bands were popping up, what 'zines were coming out,\" Thompson says. \"You could also send them your 'zine or your record or your tape and they would review it. That's how we got our first orders for Fluke.\"\n\nIn central Arkansas, before Fluke, Tim Lamb started the 'zine Lighten Up. There was also Ahoalton, created by Mark Dober, and Bobby Matthews and Matt Besser's Barking at Life. The Little Rock punk scene and those involved in it were also captured in the Richard Matson-directed 2007 documentary Towncraft.\n\nSays Mitchell Crisp, 48, a Little Rock-based film production designer who was part of the early scene and contributed to Fluke: \"'Fanzines were part of my childhood because I was a punk-rock kid in the early '80s.

Strangely enough I haven't really heard of this game before recently, when I wanted to review one of my favorite C64 games called Windwalker and realized that it is a sequel to this game. Naturally I wanted to try it and I was very pleased with the game.\n\nThe story behind the game is fairly simple and not much unlike many other RPG stories. A once peaceful kingdom (somewhere in the far east) is now under the rule of evil forces that have overtaken it and you, the player, become a disciple of Moebius and try to bring peace and harmony back to land.\n\nAs I said, a straight forward plot. However the game-play is the real gem of this game.\n\nYou start off by creating your character. Unlike most RPGs you don't have points to distribute. Instead you have to practice the skills you will need. There are three things you require to practice: bare hand combat, sword combat and divination. The last one is not a form of combat, but a test of reflexes. You need to keep the spinning yin-yang symbol within the rectangle. You will need this skill every time you advance to a higher level (slowing down the game helps while doing this \u2013 easy enough if you're using DOSBox).\n\nAfter training you enter the world of Khantun. You walk around and memorize what you see, creating your own memory map you can call up any time. You have your sword and with it you can chop down vegetation that's standing in your way. Some is tougher and requires several chops and your sword will with time get duller, so don't forget to sharpen it. To break down boulders that are in your way use the hammer (you need to get your hands on one first). And if you encounter any baddies you need to fight them (you've practiced your fighting skills, so there shouldn't be a problem there).\n\nPressing 'escape' will call up a menu, which among other things shows you the abbreviations of the commands you can use (for instance: G means GET, U means USE).

The result is a BIG list that's just as eclectic and idiosyncratic as we are, and as we've come to know you are too. We think it's a hell of a collection, and we hope you'll enjoy it and share your picks for Best of 2013 in the comments!\n\nAli Colluccio\n\nYoung Avengers by Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie (with Mike Norton, Matt Wilson, and Clayton Clowes)\n\nYoung Avengers gave me more joy than any other comic I read this year. It was the book I looked forward to reading the most each month, and the one that had me smiling and happy dancing the most. It's like really great pop music in comic book form. And I LOVE IT! At it's core, the comic is about being in your twenties and trying to get your life together, but with lots of punching and lasers and kissing and running away from your parents because they are literally trying to kill you. There is a fantastic, unstoppable energy to Young Avengers. It's full of the bold passion and invincibility of being young. And it's just so epically awesome to read.\n\nKieron Gillen does some really wonderful character work in this book. Not only do you feel like you know these people, you feel like you actually knew them when you were 20. His work with Kid Loki both in Young Avengers and earlier in Journey Into Mystery has defined the character for current comics continuity. I don't want to read a Loki that is not written by Gillen. And Jamie McKelvie's pencils! I can't even. He's doing the work of his career. The facial expressions, the action sequences, the page layouts: they're all perfectly executed and unlike that vast majority of superhero comics.\n\nOne Good Earl Deserves a Lover by Sarah MacLean\n\nI read a lot of romance novels this year, thanks to the fantastic WORDs of Love book club. But One Good Earl, the second book in Sarah MacLean's Rules of Scoundrels series, is the book that really got me hooked on romance. What I love most about romance novels is that they unabashedly embrace what they are. They celebrate love and sex and happy endings, and they usually have spectacularly punny titles.\n\nOne Good Earl has all of these things, but what sets it apart from the rest of the pack is Sarah MacLean's stellar writing. Her sense of character and drama and steamy sex scenes are all fantastic. Few writers have me wanting to tear through pages more than MacLean does. But what I love most about this book is it's bespectacled, nerdy heroine Pippa. Aside from having the best name in the history of ever, Pippa is curious, brilliant, and determined. The book opens with Pippa going to a notorious gaming hell owner and scoundrel to find out the particulars of sex for SCIENCE. Wonderful hilarity ensues.\n\nAlison Peters\n\nStay Up with Me by Tom Barbash\n\nIt's the holiday season, just past Thanksgiving, and I find myself wondering what the characters in Stay Up with Me might be doing right now: did the man with the errant wife end up throwing the yearly Thanksgiving-Day-parade party in his swank New York apartment? Was their viewing of the floats ruined by the gale force winds? Is the tennis pro getting ready to start another year on tour? What about the boy who realized his mom was going to destroy every relationship he embarked on? Can't he just love in peace?? Six months later, and this book has stayed with me like the adventures of old friends. That's the best recommendation I can give.\n\nDwelling in Possibility by Howard Mansfield\n\nI'm on a theme trend, which includes books about living space. Barbash's characters all lived the 21st century American dream life with huge homes stuffed with only the best \"stuff,\" and the hint of vacation mountain cabins and beach houses to be had when the season is right. Dwelling in Possibility: Searching for the Soul of Shelter, attempts to get to the bottom of our obsession with the home, and everything we fill it with. Howard Mansfield writes in the dreamy prose of a poet, while discussing everything from what makes a home feel like home to the rebuilding of communities after being literally bombed, flooded, or otherwise destroyed. What encapsulates the soul of any space, allowing us to call it \"home\"? At it's best, it's a spiritual undertaking of a fairly mundane topic, and at the very least, it's a nice antithesis to everything currently in holiday marathon lockdown on HGTV.\n\nAmanda Nelson\n\nThe Son by Philipp Meyer\n\nA sprawling family epic that is best described as Steinbeck-meets-Cormac-McCarthy.

Previous heritability modeling of these bitter stimuli indicated a common genetic factor for quinine, caffeine and SOA (22-28%), as well as separate specific genetic factors for PROP (72%) and quinine (15%). To identify the genes involved, we performed a genome-wide association study with the same sample as the modeling analysis, genotyped for approximately 610,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For caffeine and SOA, no SNP association reached a genome-wide statistical criterion. For PROP, the peak association was within TAS2R38 (rs713598, A49P, P = 1.6 \u00d7 10(-104)), which accounted for 45.9% of the trait variance. For quinine, the peak association was centered in a region that contains bitter receptor as well as salivary protein genes and explained 5.8% of the trait variance (TAS2R19, rs10772420, R299C, P = 1.8 \u00d7 10(-15)). We confirmed this association in a replication sample of twins of similar ancestry (P = 0.00001). The specific genetic factor for the perceived intensity of PROP was identified as the gene previously implicated in this trait (TAS2R38). For quinine, one or more bitter receptor or salivary proline-rich protein genes on chromosome 12 have alleles which affect its perception but tight linkage among very similar genes precludes the identification of a single causal genetic variant."}

(AP) \u2014 New guidelines lower the threshold for high blood pressure, adding 30 million Americans to those who have the condition, which now plagues nearly half of U.S. adults.\n\nHigh pressure, which for decades has been a top reading of at least 140 or a bottom one of 90, drops to 130 over 80 in advice announced Monday by a dozen medical groups.\n\nThe change means an additional 14 percent of U.S. adults have the problem, but only an additional 2 percent will need medication right away; the rest should try healthier lifestyles, which get much stronger emphasis in the new advice. Poor diets, lack of exercise and other bad habits cause 90 percent of high blood pressure.\n\n\"I have no doubt there will be controversy. I'm sure there will be people saying 'We have a hard enough time getting to 140,'\" said Dr. Paul Whelton, a Tulane University physician who led the guidelines panel.\n\nBut the risk for heart disease, stroke and other problems drops as blood pressure improves, and the new advice \"is more honest\" about how many people have a problem, he said.\n\nCurrently, only half of Americans with high blood pressure have it under control.\n\nThe upper threshold for high blood pressure has been 140 since 1993, but a major study two years ago found heart risks were much lower in people who aimed for 120. Canada and Australia lowered their cutoff to that; Europe is still at 140 but is due to revise its guidance next year.\n\nThe guidelines were announced Monday at an American Heart Association conference in Anaheim.\n\nWHAT THE CHANGES MEAN\n\nThe guidelines set new categories and get rid of \"prehypertension\":\n\n\u2014Normal: Under 120 over 80\n\n\u2014Elevated: Top number 120-129 and bottom less than 80\n\n\u2014Stage 1: Top of 130-139 or bottom of 80-89\n\n\u2014Stage 2: Top at least 140 or bottom at least 90\n\nThat means 46 percent of U.S. adults have high pressure (stages 1 or 2) versus 32 percent under the old levels.\n\nHow common it is will roughly triple in men under 45, to 30 percent, and double in women of that age, to 19 percent.\n\nFor people over 65, the guidelines undo a controversial tweak made three years ago to relax standards and not start medicines unless the top number was over 150. Now, everyone that old should be treated if the top number is over 130 unless they're too frail or have conditions that make it unwise.\n\n\"The evidence with this is so solid, so convincing, that it's hard to argue with the targets,\" said Dr. Jackson Wright, a guidelines panel member from University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Older people \"have a 35-to-50-fold higher risk of dying of a heart attack or stroke compared to younger people.\"\n\nBut the Cleveland Clinic's Dr. Steven Nissen said he's worried.\n\n\"Some more vulnerable patients who get treated very aggressively may have trouble with falls\" because too-low pressure can make them faint, he said.\n\nWHO NEEDS TREATMENT\n\nCertain groups, such as those with diabetes, should be treated if their top number is over 130, the guidelines say. For the rest, whether to start medication will no longer be based just on the blood pressure numbers. The decision also should consider the overall risk of having a heart problem or stroke in the next 10 years, including factors such as age, gender and cholesterol, using a simple formula to estimate those odds.\n\nThose without a high risk will be advised to improve their lifestyles \u2014 lose weight, eat healthy, exercise more, limit alcohol, avoid smoking.\n\n\"It's not just throwing meds at something,\" said one primary care doctor who praised the new approach, the Mayo Clinic's Dr. Robert Stroebel. If people continue bad habits, \"They can kind of eat and blow through the medicines,\" he said.\n\nThe guidelines warn about some popular approaches, though. There's not enough proof that consuming garlic, dark chocolate, tea or coffee helps, or that yoga, meditation or other behavior therapies lower blood pressure long-term, they say.\n\nThe government no longer writes heart guidelines, leaving it to medical groups. Unlike previous guideline panels, none on this one have recent financial ties to industry, although some on a panel that reviewed and commented on them do.\n\nThe guidelines were published in two journals \u2014 Hypertension and the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.\n\nHOW AND WHEN TO CHECK IT\n\nBlood pressure should be checked at least once a year by a health professional, and diagnosing high pressure requires 2 or 3 readings on at least two occasions.\n\nThe common way uses a cuff on the upper arm to temporarily block the flow of blood in an artery in the arm and gradually release it while listening with"}

The extensive and expensive overhaul of Gore's house included installing solar panels and geothermal heating.2\n\nIn order to determine the effectiveness of the environmentally-friendly remodel and learn whether the self-appointed spokesman of the environmental movement has amended his energy-devouring ways, the National Center for Public Policy Research obtained Gore's electricity usage information through public records requests and conversations with the Nashville Electric Service (NES).\n\nIn powering his home, Gore still greatly outpaces most Americans in energy consumption. The findings were shocking:\n\n\u2022 The past year, Gore's home energy use averaged 19,241 kilowatt hours (kWh) every month, compared to the U.S. household average of 901 kWh per month. 3,4 \u2022 Gore guzzles more electricity in one year than the average American family uses in 21 years. 5 \u2022 In September of 2016, Gore's home consumed 30,993 kWh in just one month \u2013 as much energy as a typical American family burns in 34 months. \u2022 During the last 12 months, Gore devoured 66,159 kWh of electricity just heating his pool. That is enough energy to power six average U.S. households for a year. \u2022 From August 2016 through July 2017, Gore spent almost $22,000 on electricity bills. 6 \u2022 Gore paid an estimated $60,000 to install 33 solar panels. Those solar panels produce an average of 1,092 kWh per month, only 5.7% of Gore's typical monthly energy consumption.\n\nNo matter how the numbers are viewed, Al Gore uses vastly more electricity at his home than the average American \u2013 a particularly inconvenient truth given his hypocritical calls for all Americans to reduce their home energy use.\n\nThe Data\n\nAll information included in this report was acquired through open records requests and phone calls to NES, the public electric utility for the Gore property and much of the Nashville area.\n\nThe records supplied by NES provide thorough information about Gore's home energy consumption \u2013 including kWh consumed, the amount of energy produced by solar panels on the property, money donated to the Green Power Switch program and the billing charges associated with the property's electricity usage.\n\nThe Home\n\nAl Gore resides in a 10,070-square-foot Colonial-style home in the posh Belle Meade section of Nashville, the eighth-wealthiest neighborhood in America according to the U.S. Census Bureau.7\n\nThe home, which was built in 1915, contains 20 rooms \u2013 including five bedrooms, eight full bathrooms and two half-baths. Gore purchased the property, including the home and the surrounding 2.09 acre lot, in 2002 for $2.3 million.8\n\nIn 2010, Gore announced that he and wife Tipper were divorcing after 40 years of marriage.9According to media speculation, Tipper likely lives in the $8.9 million California home the couple purchased weeks before the separation.10 The Gores have four grown children who no longer live at home. That leaves the former vice president as presumably the only occupant of the home, making his energy consumption even more staggering.\n\nGore also owns at least two other homes, a pied-\u00e0-terre in San Francisco's St. Regis Residence Club and a farm house in Carthage, Tennessee.11\n\nHome Energy Consumption\n\nThe average annual electricity consumption for a residential utility customer in America is 10,812 kWh, or 901 kWh per month, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.12 In the past 12 months, Gore's home burned through a total of 163,830 kWh. Heating the home's pool consumed another 66,159 kWh. An entry gate used an additional 900 kWh. This comes to a total of 230,889 kWh consumed at the Gore estate in a year.\n\nThat 19,241 kWh average monthly electricity usage is 21.3 times more energy than a typical American household consumes in a month.\n\nGore's electricity consumption is unfriendly to both the environment and his wallet. The former vice president's electric bill averaged $1,800 a month over the past year, not including $432 he paid each"}

In a letter sent to board members and provided to the Houston Chronicle in response to requests for comment, Houston Methodist chief executive Marc Boom said the hospital was \"saddened and surprised\" by Haufrect's lawsuit.\n\nHis letter said an investigation was launched after Haufrect raised his concerns and \"appropriate actions were taken.\" He added that recordings are made on some appointment lines to improve patient service, which is legal under Texas law.\n\nBoom said that Haufrect was removed as vice chairman of the ob-gyn department \"because he did not fulfill his duties,\" noting that Haufrect remains on staff at the same salary and benefits he received before he lost his leadership post.\n\n\"There was no retaliation - this is completely false,\" Boom said in the letter. \"We regret that Dr. Haufrect has chosen to take such a negative and spiteful action after a long-distinguished career.\"\n\nWayne Fisher, the Houston lawyer representing Haufrect, said he would not comment outside of what is in the lawsuit.\n\nInvasion of privacy\n\nRogge Dunn, an employment lawyer who handles privacy and wiretapping claims in Dallas, said that secret taping without the knowledge of either party is an invasion of privacy and a violation of wiretapping laws. If there were retaliation against the doctor who exposed the practice, it would make the situation \"doubly appalling,\" he said.\n\nDunn said it's difficult to know why Methodist, a sophisticated organization, might tape calls between patients and providers. It could be for quality control purposes, defense against malpractice claims or to gather evidence to refute harassment or other allegations, he said.\n\nBut, he added, \"You just can't do that.\"\n\nHaufrect has been on staff at Houston Methodist since 1977 and at one time served as president of the medical staff. He is known for treating famous patients, delivering the babies of many Houston Astros players including Lance Berkman, Roy Oswalt and Brad Lidge.

Chief Executive Officer Les Moonves said at a conference earlier Tuesday that Apple had put its live TV plans \"on hold.\"\n\nThe struggle highlights the difficulty new entrants face in trying to persuade media companies to overhaul the conventional pay-TV bundle, which costs about $85 a month. To break the logjam, Apple would either have to charge more, or the media companies would have to accept less.\n\nMoonves, speaking at the Business Insider Ignition conference, said he expects Apple to eventually offer a bundle of channels.\n\nApp Strategy\n\n\"This will happen,\" Moonves said. \"It has four major networks and 10 cable networks, let's say, and the price point will be in the $30s, $30 to $35, $40 maybe. People will not be spending money on channels they don't want to watch.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Apple is focused on the strategy that helped make the iPhone a breakout hit -- opening up its App Store for outside developers to sell to customers. Apple has seen a number of media companies adopt that approach with television, including Time Warner Inc., which sells HBO Now for $15 a month.\n\nThat approach may make it harder for new Apple's set-top box, which was released in October, to stand out in an increasingly crowded market where Roku Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Google Inc. also offer customers the ability to buy subscriptions to television programming.\n\nAmazon is weighing the creation of a live TV service, and plans to sell subscriptions to Showtime, Starz and other services. In addition, cable, satellite and phone providers like Comcast Corp., Dish Network Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc. are selling smaller, less expensive bundles of channels, sometimes delivered over the Internet.\n\nApple's decision to put its TV plans on hold is the latest challenge in a years-long drive that also included an effort to partner with cable companies. Even if Apple develops breakthrough technology to change how people view TV, it's still at the mercy of media companies that must supply programming.\n\nUnlike music companies, which have been willing to partner with Apple, TV programmers have been reluctant. Media executives have said they expect new TV distributors like Apple and Amazon to pay more for their channels than existing distributors. That's complicated efforts to develop lower-cost services.\n\nWithout such agreements, Apple is turning to software developers to build new entertainment content for its Apple TV set-top box. The latest version of the device, starting at $149, has an App Store for users to download games, shopping services and other video applications.\n\n\"Apps are the future of TV,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this year."}

It was a bit surreal landing in an almost empty airport.\n\n\"It was an international airport, but just one plane was landing. There was confusion with our bags and we had to spend two hours there. In that time, all the shop staff and immigration staff clocked off and all the lights went out. We were inside the airport all alone.\"\n\nThe team had to hand in their mobile phones and tablets for their photographs to be checked, while their bags were also searched and they were told to be careful what they photographed while in North Korea.\n\n\"The funny thing was a few North Korea memes had been sent around in the group Whatsapp, poking fun at Kim Jong-un. Before we left we had told everyone to delete the messages, we were all sitting there waiting for someone to get caught.\n\n\"I was hoping they didn't have Twitter, I had joked about meeting Kim for a drink.\"\n\nMany of the team's bags - including kits, boots and balls - were lost in transit. It led to some players having to buy boots from a seller at the hotel, who Paartalu says was charging US$150-200 for \"fake boots\".\n\nHe added: \"We had no boots, training kits or balls for the first training session.

He furthermore says, \"The United States considers the most dangerous potential alliance to be between Russia and Germany. This would be an alliance of German technology and capital with Russian natural and human resources.\" So: the U.S. is trying to antagonize Germans against Russia. This will weaken both of them. However, that would be not a \"balance of power\" but an increasing imbalance of power in favor of the United States. The Russian interviewer failed to catch his inconsistency on that.\n\nFriedman was consistent with the U.S. Government's line that Russia is a threat to the U.S.; he said: \"No American president can afford to sit idly by if Russia becomes more and more influential.\" He said that this is especially the case in the Middle East, and regarding Syria. But he then clarified himself, \"I'm not saying that Russia's intervention in the Syrian conflict was the cause of the Ukrainian crisis, it would be a stretch.\" Regarding Ukraine, he said: \"The bottom line is that the strategic interests of the United States are to prevent Russia from becoming a hegemon. And the strategic interests of Russia are not to allow the US close to its borders.\" He avoided even to mention the United States as possibly being a \"hegemon\" itself, one which is trying, along with its NATO allies, to crush Russia for its resisting America's hegemony -- that is, global dominance by America's aristocracy.\n\nPresident Obama had something to say about this very question when speaking at West Point on May 28th and asserting (with loaded anti-Russian assumptions and false outright allegations): \"Russia's aggression toward former Soviet states unnerves capitals in Europe, while China's economic rise and military reach worries its neighbors. From Brazil to India, rising middle classes compete with us. \" The United States is and remains the one indispensable nation. That has been true for the century passed [sp.: past [[somebody at the White House didn't even know the difference between 'past' and 'passed' and still don't, six months afterward]] and it will be true for the century to come.\" So: The U.S. President was telling West Point's graduating cadets that the U.S. is the only hegemon and will stay that way for at least a hundred years. This was their marching-order, from the U.S President himself, their own Commander-in-Chief, representing America's aristocracy (in this alleged 'democracy'), for whom they will fight and kill, and, some of them, perhaps even die, or else become crippled for life.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFriedman closed by saying, \"Russia will not make concessions in the Crimea, this is obvious. But I believe that it could face serious problems with supplies to the peninsula. Yet Moscow cannot retreat from some of its requirements with regard to Ukraine. It cannot be allowed that Western military appear in Ukraine. This is a nightmare in Moscow. \" This is already happening, slowly but occurs. And it will be something that Russia does not accept \" The US is not aiming that you need to have control over Ukraine, but that it is important that it is not controlled by Russia.\" Here he was repeating his idea that America isn't seeking to achieve advantage over Russia -- that the U.S. has no hegemonic intentions, just \"balance of power,\" notwithstanding the Commander-in-Chief's charge, months earlier, to his troops, for them to extend America's hegemony another century.\n\nHe said that this overthrow in Ukraine was a coup aimed against Russia, but then he closed with this statement that Russia is hegemonic but that the U.S. is not, which contradicts it.\n\nApparently, Mr. Friedman was"}

Not actually true. In a new review of research, University of Michigan psychologist Terri Conley and colleagues debunked six common gender-essentialist myths.\n\n1) Men want \"attractiveness,\" while women want \"status\"\n\nSure, maybe on paper they do, but in the real world where actual relationships take place, attraction doesn't fall into such simple stereotypes. Shocking, I know.\n\n2) Men want many more sexual partners than women do\n\nTurns out if you look at medians instead of averages to avoid skewing the data with a few Don Juan wannabes, men and women both say they want one sexual partner. (Just one! That is truly the most surprising finding of the whole study.) And if you get people to tell the truth, gender differences in actual sexual partners disappear too.\n\n3) Men think about sex more than women do\n\nOk, they do. But only 18 times a day\u2013not nearly the every seven seconds we were told! And they also think about other needs, like food and sleep, more than women do.\n\n4) Women have fewer orgasms than men do\n\nTrue, but the \"orgasm gap\" is clearly more dependent on relationship type than biology. While women orgasmed about a third as much as men during first-time hookups, that number jumps to 79% in committed relationships.\n\n5) Men like casual sex more than women do\n\nThis is one of the most persistent myths out there. But the researchers say that women's reluctance to accept an offer of casual sex is mostly because they're not convinced the guy will be good in bed (see #4) and are afraid of being slut-shamed. If you account for these two barriers, the gender difference disappears.\n\n6) Women are pickier than men\n\nEveryone tends to be choosier when they're approached by a potential partner, and less choosy when they're doing the approaching. So it's our lingering expectation that men do the asking and women the accepting\u2013not some evolutionary bullshit about spreading seeds\u2013that keeps this myth alive.\n\nThe researchers end with a nice little smackdown of evolutionary psychologists' explanations for gender differences in sexuality. Instead of being rooted in our evolutionary past, such differences can be explained by \"much more mundane causes: stigma against women for expressing sexual desires; women's socialization to attend to other's needs rather than their own; and, more broadly, a double standard that dictates (different sets of) appropriate sexual behaviors for men and women.\"\n\nWord. Now please let's put these myths to bed for good."}

The news of Taliban leader Mullah Omar's death being kept secret by Pakistan for around five years, the spate of bombings in Kabul, and Islamabad's failure to keep its promise on intelligence-sharing and reining in Taliban cadres has disillusioned Ghani. Reports of a Loya Jirga being called \u2014 that could lead to his ouster \u2014 have further pushed the president to look to India for assistance.\n\nHis departure from predecessor Hamid Karzai's policy towards India saw him reach out to Pakistani generals in the hope that a give-and-take was possible. But, Pakistan's overall strategy to secure its geopolitical objectives in the region is at odds with Kabul's expectations. Many argue that it was na\u00efve on Ghani's part to have directly engaged with ISI in the hope of a solution to Afghanistan's security concerns.\n\nHis failed strategy has now forced him to engage India after flirtations with Pakistani military and ISI brought greater misery for the country. India, on its part, is quite confident about the results of such an effort. This weekend Afghan national security advisor and deputy foreign minister will be in Delhi to discuss a fast deteriorating security situation, and seek assistance.\n\nIndia's total aid package of Rs 12,800 crore ($2 billion) to the country includes the construction of the Parliament building. Besides building a dam in Herat province to generate 42 MW of electricity and constructing 218 km of road through Border Roads Organisation, India in the last five years has also given food aid of 250,000 mt of wheat. It has been helping with training programmes, scholarships and skill development too.\n\nIn the coming days, three Mi-25 attack helicopters India bought from Russia will be handed over to Afghan government. This is a departure from not providing military assistance to Afghanistan.\n\nBut, what can India do that looks beyond traditional ways of extending assistance?\n\nIndia has tremendous brand equity among the people of Afghanistan. Historic ties part, Bollywood films and songs have culturally tied them with us as much as their belief that, unlike Pakistan, India seeks a stable and independent Afghanistan. India hosts thousands of Afghan refugees, patients and students in various parts of the country.\n\nGiven its landlocked status, Afghanistan is dependent on Pakistan for imports and exports. The latter is Afghanistan's largest trading partner and the former is its second-largest export market.\n\nThe two countries initially signed the Afghanistan Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA) in 1965. In 2010, the trade agreement was altered to allow Afghan exports transit through Pakistan to the Wagah border with India, and to the seaport cities of Karachi and Gwadar. Pakistani trucks in turn are allowed to move products to all regions of Afghanistan.\n\nAfghanistan's total reported exports are currently equivalent to only five percent of total imports, with Pakistan as the largest export destination, accounting for 32.2 percent of all Afghan exports. Iran has now got closer with the access it provides to the Persian Gulf through land routes and the Chahbahar Port that India jointly helped build to end Kabul's complete dependence on Pakistan for access to sea and rest of the global economy.\n\nIndia, on the other hand, forms the second largest destination for Afghan exports despite the lack of direct transit access. Afghanistan's requests to secure India land access through Wagah border have not been entertained by Islamabad. Pakistani industry fears that Indian goods might get smuggled in large quantities impacting its businesses apart from the military's inherent policy to deny India greater presence in a country that it sees as giving it strategic depth.\n\nWith US forces drawdown, the growth of Taliban and Islamic State forces, Pakistan military squeezing Afghanistan and a government in Kabul that seems increasingly out of depth on tackling current challenges, India has an opportunity to connect directly with the people by thinking out of the box.\n\nHere's what India needs to consider:\n\n-Pakistan is Afghanistan's largest trade partner and its main market for exports\n\n-Pakistan controls Afghanistan's food economy, ISI controls importing/exporting companies\n\n-Pakistan dictates prices of fruit exports from Afghanistan\n\n-Afghan carpet industry lacks basic infrastructure to provide finished carpets and rugs. They are bought by Pakistani companies at cheap prices, finished and stamped with a 'Made in Pakistan' label\n\n-The announcement of Mullah Omar's death has made Afghans more distrustful of Pakistanis (in recent days, they even banned Pakistani medicines)\n\n-India invested in infrastructure projects largely like roads and dams\n\n-With a worsening security situation, the ISI is trying to stop the Afghan government from using the north to trade with CIS countries\n\nAnd here are the immediate challenges:\n\nCan the Indian government get market access to the Afghan fruit industry and dry fruit growers through chartered freight flights that help sell melons, grapes and pomegranates in cities like Delhi and Mumbai?"}

The article states that national law shall not be applied to Hong Kong unless added to Annex III of the Basic Law.\n\nThe association stated that such logic \"completely bypasses and emasculates\" requirements under the article, as the idea suggested that mainland laws could be applied to any part of Hong Kong designated by the government, such as the High Court Building, as long as this did not cover the entire city.\n\nIt criticised the NPCSC's decision for not fully explaining why the mainland port area in the West Kowloon terminus should be seen as being on the mainland, as well as why it would not affect the city's high degree of autonomy.\n\nThe association also said the decision had generated a strong perception among legal communities in and outside Hong Kong, as well as political communities outside the city, that the NPCSC was prepared to make decisions at the request of the city's chief executive and the government just because the subject matter concerned was \"a good thing\", without respect for the country's constitution and the Basic Law.\n\n\"Such a strong perception will surely impair and undermine the confidence of the local and international communities on the maintenance of the rule of law and the 'one country, two systems' policy in Hong Kong, both of which are provided for by the Basic Law,\" the statement said.\n\nThe city's leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said in a press conference on Wednesday that the co-location arrangement was a \"good thing\" for Hong Kong's development.\n\nA group of six legal heavyweights intending to contest the Bar Association election next month welcomed the position stated by the association.\n\n\"[The association's position] had been long awaited by the legal community and the Hong Kong public.

The state is preparing a pilot program.\n\nBut there are plenty of unanswered questions.\n\nAbout 2,800 Washington drivers will hit the roads in January, testing whether it makes more sense to charge them for every mile instead of the current gas tax. Some drivers will have GPS monitors attached to their cars. Others will simply use their odometer readings to track mileage. They will pay the gas tax at the pump but get reimbursed so that they are taxed for the number of miles driven.\n\nReema Griffith, executive director of the Washington State Transportation Commission, said the plan is to replace the gas tax if this road usage charge works.\n\n\"The full intent is to replace the gas tax,\" she said. \"How that happens, in terms of the time-frame of transition, is up in the air. Those kinds of things will ultimately be settled by the Legislature.\"\n\nThat transition could last a decade. Griffith said the state can't just turn the gas tax off.\n\n\"Our gas tax is heavily leveraged,\" she said. \"We have a lot of debt issued against it to generate all the dollars we have over the years to build all of these projects. We have about a 25-year debt that we have to deal with.\"\n\nOregon is already using the road usage charge on a limited basis, but it has no plans to get rid of the gas tax.\n\n\"The gas tax would have to stick around because given the technology for road usage charging there are older vehicles that just aren't compatible with that, and we'd need some way of having them pay for the roads they are using,\" said Michelle Godfrey with the Oregon Department of Transportation.\n\nAnd it's not just Oregon and Washington state looking at this. There are 12 western states investigating whether there should be a regional or even a national system set up so that you would pay for every mile you drive, some with a gas tax too, others not.\n\n\"A visitor from, say, Washington to Oregon fills up in Oregon and drives in Oregon they'd be paying the Oregon fuel tax,\" Godfrey said. \"It's not a perfect system because you could fill up in Washington and then drive in Oregon, and Washington is getting the benefit of that tax dollar.\"\n\nRELATED: Transportation official fights Dori's notion of new road tolls\n\nThat's why Washington's pilot program will include drivers from Oregon. Griffith said they will use drivers who frequently travel back and forth between the two states to try and find out how a regional system might work.\n\n\"How do our two states reconcile that?\" Griffith asked. \"We're going to work it through, not just the collection of it, but dealing with our treasuries and our laws.\"\n\nSo why the big push to change the funding mechanism for roads? Griffith said the gas tax just isn't a stable funding source going into the future. Cars are getting more fuel efficient which means they are filling up less often. That translates into less gas tax money going forward. She said something needs to replace that dwindling revenue.\n\n\"It's not if, it's when,\" she said, referring to when the gas tax no longer fills the bill. \"We're going to have to make a switch to something, and if it's not this we just say, then what?\" she asked. \"The revenue has to come from somewhere for our infrastructure, and we're talking billion and billions of dollars. It's not a small amount of money.\"\n\nWashington has about 2,800 volunteers signed up for the year-long pilot project, but it is still looking for volunteers. Griffith said they would like to get about 8,000 signed up so the state can make sure it gets a good cross-section of drivers. The pilot needs people from all over the state, with vehicles of all kinds."}
{"id": 957, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "ABSTRACT\n\nWe investigated the degradation, metabolism, fate, and selected effects of pectin in the intestinal tract of rats. Conventional and germfree rats were fed for 3 wk diets containing 6.5% pectin (degree of methylation 34.5, 70.8 and 92.6%, respectively) or pectin-free diets. Pectin passes the small intestine as a macromolecule. The molecular weight distribution of pectins isolated from intestinal contents of germfree rats were unaffected by diet. No or very little galacturonan was found in cecum, colon or feces of most of the conventional rats. In colon contents of some conventional rats, di- and trigalacturonic acid were present. Total anaerobic and Bacteroides counts were greater in groups fed pectin. The concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) was higher in cecum and feces in all pectin-fed groups. With increasing degree of methylation, the formation rate of SCFA decreased in the cecum of conventional rats. During in vitro fermentation of pectin with fecal flora from rats, unsaturated oligogalacturonic acids appeared as intermediate products. Low-methoxyl pectin was fermented faster than high-methoxyl pectins in vivo and in vitro. Pectin-fed rats had greater ileum, cecum and colon weights. We conclude that structural parameters of pectin influence its microbial degradation in the intestinal tract.\n\nPectin occurs in the human diet in different forms: as a constituent of plant cell walls (fruits, vegetables and products of them) or in isolated form (for instance in jams, jellies or milk products). In contrast to most of the other dietary fibers (DF),3 the homogalacturonan component of pectin consists of an acidic moiety, the galacturonic acid (GalA) joined in chains by \u03b1-(1\u21924) glycosidic linkages. The carboxyl groups of the GalA moieties are partly esterified by methanol. An important feature of homogalacturonans is the degree of methylation (DM), defined as the number of moles of methanol per 100 mol GalA. Many functional properties of pectin (rheological behavior, gelation or binding of metal ions) are dependent on its structural parameters like molecular weight, DM or distribution of free and methoxylated carboxyl groups within the galacturonan chains. It was shown that some physiological effects like interactions with bile acids (1,2) or drugs in vitro (3) may be influenced by pectin structure.\n\nIn the small intestine, physiological effects of pectin (interactions with bile acids, lowering of serum cholesterol, effects on the postprandial lipemia, etc.) are closely related to its macromolecular status. Pectin is not depolymerized by intestinal enzymes; however, a partial degradation seems to be possible under the physicochemical conditions of the stomach and small intestine. Pectin is more or less completely fermented by the microflora in cecum and colon of conventional (normal) rats (4) or in the colon of humans (5). This degradation is a multistep process: depolymerization under formation of oligomeric and monomeric GalA, fermentation of the monomers preferentially via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas and the pentose phosphate pathways (6) and formation of the SCFA acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate as well as of different gases as end products. Among these, butyrate plays an important role in the energy metabolism and proliferation of colonocytes (7). As a result of fermentation of DF such as pectin, the qualitative and quantitative composition of the microflora (germ numbers and bacteria species) may be changed. Therefore, the determination of the production of SCFA and composition of microflora as well of the presence and disappearance of pectin gives information on its fate in the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, it is interesting to evaluate the intermediate formation of the oligogalacturonic acids (OligoGalA). The key enzyme in the degradation of pectin by the intestinal microflora is pectate lyase, which splits the \u03b1-(1\u21924) glycosidic bonds between the GalA units by a \u03b2-eliminative mechanism under generation of 4,5-double bonds in the nonreducing end of the cleaved substrate (unsaturated OligoGalA).\n\nTo be absorbed, pectin has to be degraded to GalA or its oligomers with a low degree of polymerization (DP). It is unclear whether OligoGalA appear as stable metabolites of p"}

The body is thought to be the first forensically proven casualty of the Spanish conquest, one of 72 apparent victims of an uprising against the conquistadors.\n\nCock, who has worked more than 20 years to unravel the mysteries of these Indian gravesites, had dug a test trench in a hillside in the suburb of Puruchuco at the request of the Lima city government, which planned a road there. In the 6- by 24-meter trench, Cock and archaeologist colleague Elena Goycochea quickly struck a set of graves and concluded that the spot had been a cemetery.\n\nSince they began digging in 2004, the team has excavated about 500 skeletons dating back some 500 years to the Inca civilization. Known as the Romans of the New World, the Inca conquered the entire Andean region until their reign ended in 1532 with the Spanish invasion.\n\nCock found that 72 of the bodies on the hillside had been buried without the usual Inca reverence for death, such as being ritually wrapped, placed in a crouched position and facing east. \"These bodies were strangely buried,\" Cock said. \"They were not facing the right direction, they were tied up or hastily wrapped in a simple cloth, they had no offerings and they were buried at a shallow depth. Some of the bodies also showed signs of terrible violence. They had been hacked, torn, impaled -- injuries that looked as if they had been caused by iron weapons -- and several had injuries on their heads and faces that looked as if they were caused by gunshots.\"\n\nOne of the skulls bore an entrance and exit wound, and nearby a plug of bone that might have been blasted out of the skull was found. At first, Cock thought the holes in the skull were modern -- resulting from vandals' shots. But the plug of bone, recovered intact, reflected an impact much less forceful than any modern gunshot and carried a distinct concave imprint highly suggestive of a musket ball.\n\nBased on evidence from the field site, Cock became convinced he had found a gunshot victim from Inca times. Physical anthropologist John Verano of Tulane University agreed after making field observations; team member and bio-archaeologist Melissa Murphy of Bryn Mawr College suggested they search for definitive evidence.\n\nTo determine conclusively if the wound was caused by a gunshot, Cock and his team decided to use technology to examine the skull for any traces of metal residue around the edges of the wound. Cock, Goycochea and Murphy took the skull and other bones to Lima's renowned Resomasa center for CT scanning. No evidence of metal emerged.\n\nUndaunted, Cock turned to forensic scientist Tim Palmbach at the University of New Haven, who called in the university's Henry C. Lee Institute of Forensic Science in Connecticut, one of the world's foremost forensic facilities. \"We tried to rule out all kinds of causes of the hole -- a rock from a slingshot, spear, sledgehammer,\" said Al Harper, executive director of the institute. \"We were asking what could have been responsible for this pattern of injury.\"\n\nHarper and Palmbach then decided to view the skull with a powerful scanning electronic microscope. \"We all thought it was a million-to-one chance that we would find any traces of metal on a skull that old, but it was worth a try,\" Harper said.\n\nThey did. Edges of the holes in the skull and the entire bone plug were found to be impregnated with fragments of iron, a metal sometimes used for Spanish musket balls. It appears that a musket ball less than an inch in diameter had punched into the back of the skull and passed through the head, leaving pieces of iron deep inside the bone that stayed there for 500 years.\n\n\"This conclusively proves that the person was killed by a gunshot, and he is the first identified shooting victim in the Americas,\" Cock said. Since the initial find, at least two other apparent gunshot victims have been identified.\n\nThe injuries on the skull and the two other bodies were believed caused by weapons consistent with those used by Spanish soldiers at the time. The guns used to inflict these injuries were some of the world's first firearms --16th-century Europe's most advanced military technology, according to military historian John Guilmartin of West Point Military Academy. \"The Spaniards knew how to use them,\" he said.\n\nCock and his team believe the killings took place in the summer of 1536 during an Inca uprising against the Spanish occupiers led by Francisco Pizarro, known as the siege of Lima. Among the 72 hastily buried bodies were several women and adolescents. Cock said these would not have been soldiers but attendants and supporters of the warriors"}

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya)\n\nESPN reporters Mark Fainaru-Wada and Steve Fainaru are writing a book about football and brain injuries, to be published in 2013 by Crown Books, a division of Random House, and FRONTLINE is producing a documentary based on the reporters' research. This article was produced as part of a collaboration with ESPN. League of Denial airs Oct. 8 on FRONTLINE.\n\nMore than a decade ago, the sports equipment manufacturer Riddell was developing a highly anticipated new football helmet designed to reduce players' risk of concussions. The helmet was ambitiously called the Revolution. It would become the most widely used helmet in the NFL and earn millions in sales to players in college, high school and youth leagues.\n\nBut back in 2000 the company received a warning: A biomechanics firm hired first by the NFL and later by Riddell to test helmets and study head injuries sent the company a report showing that no football helmet, no matter how revolutionary, could prevent concussions.\n\nIn fact, the report stated, even a helmet that passed the industry safety standard for protection against skull fractures and other severe head injuries could leave a player with a 95 percent likelihood of receiving a concussion from a strong enough blow.\n\nYet the report, made public during a recent Colorado lawsuit, did not deter Riddell from marketing the helmet as protection against concussions. Riddell promoted the Revolution by saying that players who wore it were 31 percent less likely to suffer a concussion \u2013 a figure criticized as an exaggeration by leading experts on head injuries and some members of Congress.\n\nRiddell is being sued by thousands of former NFL players as a co-defendant in the major lawsuit against the league. The plaintiffs charge, in part, that Riddell failed to warn them that its helmet would not protect against concussion. Last month, in the Colorado case, Riddell was found liable for $3.1 million out of a total of $11.5 million that was awarded to the family of a young man who was seriously injured after a concussion in a high school football practice.\n\nThe Colorado jury cleared Riddell of a charge that its helmet had a design flaw. But it found that the company had failed to adequately warn players of the risks of concussion. Riddell said it plans to appeal the verdict.\n\n\"While disappointed in the jury's decision not to fully exonerate Riddell, we are pleased the jury determined that Riddell's helmet was not defective in any way,\" the company said in a statement. \"We intend to appeal this verdict, and we remain steadfast in our belief that Riddell designs and manufactures the most protective football headgear for the athlete.\"\n\nFrank Azar, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the Colorado case, said that the outcome could have implications for the larger suit by NFL players. \"What it proves is that Riddell knew for sure in November of 2000 that they had a problem with their testing of these helmets and they didn't disclose it to anybody,\" he said.\n\nChris Withnall, who wrote the 2000 report to Riddell as the senior engineer at the Ottawa-based biomechanical firm Biokinetics, said recently, \"No helmet can prevent a concussion. Full stop.\"\n\nThe Push to Create a Better Helmet\n\nConcussions in sports, especially football, have become the focus of intense study and debate. But they are still not well-understood injuries. Two players with the same medical history can receive the same kind of blow and respond differently. Building equipment to minimize the dangers requires overcoming many obstacles.\n\nConcussions are often caused by a combination of what are called \"linear\" and \"rotational\" accelerations. In linear acceleration, the head is moving in a straight line when it suddenly stops, as in many car accidents. During rotational acceleration, the head is twisting or struck from one side, which can cause a shearing effect on the brain. While it is known that rotational acceleration may be more correlated with concussion, it is not known just how much will cause a concussion. Without a threshold it's impossible to create a test that will measure the risk of concussion.\n\n\"Nobody knows how to make a helmet that prevents a concussion,\" Withnall said. \"We know [the research is] moving in the right direction but there are still these rotational motions that we can't control.\"\n\nRiddell designed the Revolution helmet with the help of Biokinetics, which was also working with the NFL's Minor Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee.\n\nThe NFL formed the MTBI Committee in 1994 in response to high-profile concussions. One of the committee's goals was to improve understanding of the biomechanics of concussion, and to use that information"}

Mississippian sites have been identified within the river valleys of nearly a third of what is today the United States, including an area centered in Illinois but found as far south as the Florida panhandle, west as Oklahoma, north as Minnesota, and east as Ohio.\n\nMississippian Chronology\n\n1539 - Hernando de Soto's expedition visits Mississippian polities from Florida to Texas\n\n1450-1539 - mound centers regroup, some develop paramount leaders\n\n1350-1450 - Cahokia abandoned, many other mound centers decrease in population\n\n1100-1350 - multiple mound centers arise radiating out from Cahokia\n\n1050-1100 - Cahokia's \"Big Bang,\" population peaks at 10,000-15,000, colonization efforts begin in the north\n\n800-1050 - un-palisaded villages and intensification of maize exploitation, Cahokia population at about 1000 by AD 1000\n\nRegional Cultures\n\nThe term Mississippian is a broad umbrella term that includes several similar regional archaeological cultures. The southwestern portion of this huge area (Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma and adjacent states) is known as Caddo; the Oneota is found in Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin); Fort Ancient is the term referring to Mississippian-like towns and settlements in the Ohio River Valley of Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana; and the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex includes the states of Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. At a minimum, all of these distinctive cultures shared cultural traits of mound construction, artifact forms, symbols, and stratified ranking.\n\nMississippian cultural groups were independent chiefdoms which were primarily connected, at varying levels, by loosely organized trade systems and warfare. The groups shared a common ranked societal structure; a farming technology based on the \"three sisters\" of maize, beans, and squash; fortification ditches and palisades; large earthen flat-topped pyramids (called \"platform mounds\"); and a set of rituals and symbols referring to fertility, ancestor worship, astronomical observations, and war.\n\nOrigins of the Mississippians\n\nThe archaeological site of Cahokia is the largest of the Mississippian sites and arguably the main generator for most of the ideas that make up Mississippian culture. It was located in the segment of the Mississippi River Valley in the central United States known as the American Bottom. In this rich environment just east of the modern day city of St. Louis, Missouri, Cahokia rose to become an enormous urban settlement. It has by far the largest mound of any Mississippian site and held a population of between 10,000-15,000 at its heyday. Cahokia's center called Monk's Mound covers an area of five hectares (12 acres) at its base and stands over 30 meters (~100 feet) tall. The vast majority of Mississippian mounds in other places are no more than 3 m (10 ft) high.\n\nBecause of Cahokia's extraordinary size and early development, American archaeologist Timothy Pauketat has argued that Cahokia was the regional polity which provided the impetus for the incipient Mississippian civilization. Certainly, in terms of chronology, the habit of constructing mound centers began at Cahokia and then moved outward into the Mississippi Delta and Black Warrior valleys in Alabama, followed by centers in Tennessee and Georgia.\n\nThat is not to say that Cahokia ruled these areas, or even had direct hands-on influence in their construction. One key identifying the independent rise of the Mississippian centers is the multiplicity of languages that were used by the Mississippians. Seven distinct language families were used in the Southeast alone (Muskogean, Iroquoian, Catawban, Caddoan, Algonkian, Tunican, Timuacan), and many of the languages were mutually unintelligible. Despite this, most scholars support the centrality of Cahokia and suggest that the different Mississippian polities emerged as a combination of a product of several intersecting local and external factors.\n\nWhat Connects the Cultures to Cahokia?\n\nArchaeologists have identified several traits connecting Cahokia to the vast number of other Mississippian chiefdoms. Most of those studies indicate that Cahokia's influence varied over time and space.

But both of these notions have been largely dismissed.\n\nGenetic commingling\n\nWhether the makers of the Sulawesi tools are also derived from H. erectus\u2014which lived in nearby Java at least 1.5 million years ago\u2014is impossible to know without fossil evidence.\n\nBut the new discovery, van den Bergh said, raises the intriguing possibility of a link with the earliest humans to populate what is today Australia.\n\nTalepu Excavation 4 (at the base of Talepu hill) in 2012.

They survived until at least 40,000 years ago.\n\nFossil records are so meagre\u2014a few teeth and a pinkie bone excavated from a cave in Siberia\u2014that scientists don't even know what they might have looked like.\n\nBut the DNA link with Australia's original inhabitants strongly suggests that some made their way deep into Asia.\n\n\"The genetic exchange between the ancestors of the modern Australians and Denisovans probably took place somewhere in Southeast Asia,\" van den Bergh said.\n\n\"It could well be that the makers of the recently dated stone tools from Sulawesi could have been these Denisovans.\"\n\nUnfortunately, DNA does not survive nearly as well in tropical climes as in frigid Siberia, so the chances of finding genetic clues are diminished.\n\nOne thing that is certain, the study said, is that the tools were not made by Homo sapiens. \"They are just too old for that,\" van den Bergh said.\n\nThe sharp-edged tools\u2014single- or double-faced\u2014were made by chipping flakes away from a piece of limestone.\n\nExplore further: Dental analysis suggests Homo floresiensis was a separate species from modern man\n\nMore information: Gerrit D. van den Bergh et al.

But he also wrote, \"We are legally prohibited from blocking such requests based solely on the content of that speech, however sickening it is.\"\n\nHe said university administrators would begin discussions with Spencer's National Policy Institute about holding an event at the state flagship school. \"If we cannot assure a reasonably safe setting for the event, we will not allow it to go forward,\" he said.\n\nLast Friday, the attorney representing a supporter of Spencer, Cameron Padgett, wrote Schlissel.\n\n\"I am disgusted and dismayed that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution is being flippantly disregarded by you and your colleagues because of the political viewpoint of the speakers who would attend the proposed event and the heckler's veto which is being utilized by left-wing individuals who are detractors of Padgett and Spencer,\" said Kyle Bristow, the attorney.\n\nOn Tuesday, the university's board of regents held a special public meeting to discuss Spencer's request.\n\nHis supporters have asked to rent space for events at several universities this fall, after he led a torchlight march in August through the University of Virginia that turned violent. Several schools denied his request, citing imminent safety concerns. The University of Florida allowed Spencer to speak, leading the state's governor to declare a state of emergency before Spencer arrived on campus and forcing the school to absorb more than $500,000 in security costs.\n\n[Florida governor declares state of emergency in advance of Richard Spencer speech]\n\nAfter other universities in recent months denied Spencer's request to make appearances, lawsuits were filed against Michigan State, Penn State and Ohio State universities, seeking to force them to allow the white nationalist to speak.\n\nEarlier this year, a federal judge overturned Auburn University's decision to cancel a speech by Spencer, ruling the ban was unconstitutional because it was predicated on the content of the speech. The judge also found no evidence Spencer promoted violence.\n\nThe Michigan Daily, the student newspaper, showed a room full of students at the board of regents meeting Tuesday holding up handmade cardboard signs opposing Spencer, and quoted the Black Student Union on campus as demanding in an email that Schlissel deny the request: \"Allowing such a person to speak on this campus is a threat to the physical and emotional safety of many students on campus.

It takes a lot of moxie and muscle to down a three hundred foot high tree. But they did. How?\n\nThe first step in cutting down a large redwood tree often included setting springboards. These were placed into notches in the tree which were cut with an axe. The springboards acted as scaffolding to allow the fallers access to the base of the tree above basal swells, basal hollows or to gain access to the downhill side of a tree growing on a hillside.\n\nOnce the fallers could get into position they began the process of chopping the face cut with axes. The face cut would be chopped into the tree facing the intended direction that the tree was to fall. The idea is to cut 1/3 to 1/2 of the way through the tree with the bottom of the face cut being horizontal and the top being angled downward; essentially removing a pie piece from the tree.\n\nIt was important for the tree to fall in the correct direction. And to ensure this, the back of the face cut needed to be perfectly perpendicular to the direction of fall. To make certain they had accomplished this task fallers would typically make use of a gun stick.\n\nAfter the face cut was completed a layout was constructed on the ground. Because redwoods are relatively fragile the logs will break when the tree is cut if they fall onto rough ground. So workers would pile up mounds of loose soil or brush in the path of the tree to be felled. The layout would also be enhanced by smoothing out any high spots in the layout to further prevent breakage.\n\nHow big should the axed cut be? Look at the photo left.\n\nWhen the face cut was done and the layout was completed then the fallers would begin the back cut. The back cut was made using a long crosscut saw with one faller on either end and each would pull the saw through the cut in turn. The idea was to make the back cut parallel to the face cut and nearly on the same plane as the bottom of the face cut. When the back cut had sufficiently cut through enough of the wood the tree would begin to tip toward the face cut and the fallers would scramble off the spring boards to watch the tree fall into the layout.\n\nThe men and their tools: the axe, the saw and the \"gun stick\" behind the men lying in the cut. This was used to sight the direction of fall:\n\nThe loggers' tools were few and simple as this diagram at right shows:"}

Research indicates that people who appreciate things feel a strong sense of satisfaction, and are more optimistic. As such, they are much happier.\n\nTO DO \u2013 Power up your sense of gratitude, start a weekly \"gratitude journal\" in which you write about things that make you feel grateful.\n\n#2 Stay optimistic \u2013 If you are pessimistic, feeling happy is almost impossible. Everything gets filtered through a dark, negative attitude, and is colored accordingly. Instead, be optimistic about life. Work to enhance your coping skills, so you feel energized and more goal-oriented.\n\nTO DO \u2013 Be more optimistic, write down how you see your life going if things go right. This visualization exercise will help activate your \"optimistic muscles.\"\n\n#3 Don't overthink \u2013 When you worry constantly about problems (\"self-focused rumination\"), like a dog gnawing at a bone, you will naturally feel bad, sad and depressed. This rut is remarkably self-defeating. So is routinely comparing yourself negatively to others.\n\nTO DO \u2013 Break this harmful bad habit, don't indulge in it. Switch your focus to something enjoyable instead, like exercise or a movie.\n\n#4 Be kind \u2013 The ultimate happiness secret is being kind. When you go out of your way to be kind, you will feel good about yourself and eliminate negative feelings including guilt and emotional distress. When you are kind, you immediately turbo charge a positive attitude.\n\nTO DO \u2013 Exercise kindness by engaging in volunteer activities \u2013 you couldn't possibly spend your time in a more rewarding way.\n\n#5 Become social \u2013 The overarching message of Barbra Streisand's song, \"People Who Need People,\" is that such people \"are the luckiest people in the world.\" Psychologists agree that the need for social inclusion is one of every humans' strongest motivational forces.\n\nTO DO \u2013 Be social to be happy, so make time for others.\n\n#6 Learn to cope \u2013 Stress is universal and may be brought on by a wide variety of problems. You can't become happy if you don't know how to cope with stress. Address your problems by focusing on finding solutions. Take things step by step.\n\nTO DO \u2013 Develop a strategy and an action plan. Seek advice. If the stress is emotional, not situational, do something that makes you feel good. Go on a hike. Listen to soothing music. Visit a friend. Writing about stress can help alleviate it.\n\n#7 Forgive others \u2013 Often, old bromides contain the most truth and, thereby, remain timely. \"Forgive and forget\" is one such maxim. Psychologists confirm that people who hold on to anger, resentment and hostility hurt themselves both emotionally and physically. Of course, forgiving someone who has done you wrong is not easy.\n\nTO DO \u2013 One way to try is to write a forgiveness letter to that individual. Include details about how the person wronged you. Then forgive him or her in writing. You don't have to send the letter. Getting the hurtful emotions out is what counts. When you do that, you free yourself of them.\n\n#8 Seize the moment \u2013 Do you live in the future, planning how wonderful things will be when you become rich, lose weight, marry your true love or get a better job? Or do you live in the past, regretting actions that you took or didn't take. Why not live in the all-important present? Think about it: The present really is all you have.\n\nTO DO \u2013 Be in the present is to focus on your current activities. As psychologist William James wrote, \"My experience is what I agree to attend to.\" Pay attention to your life. Make each moment in your life meaningful. Don't waste a minute.\n\n#9 Be joyful \u2013 Do you savor your life and enjoy each minute? If not, why not? With the right attitude, even the mundane can be exquisite. Eating breakfast can be a blissful experience if you make it so. So can getting into bed and falling asleep.\n\nTO DO \u2013 Use your imagination to enrich your life. Recall wonderful experiences from the past. Make them real again in your mind. Research indicates that nearly one in three individuals gains valuable perspective on current challenges after engaging in \"positive reminiscence.\"\n\n#10 Become goal-oriented \u2013 People who strongly commit to goals commit to life. Of course, their goals need to be sensible, achievable and truly fulfilling. Are yours? Many people set the goal of becoming rich or improving their physical appearance. But research indicates that being wealthy or beautiful does not guarantee happiness. Indeed, such \"extrinsic goals\" can get in the way of the more important \"intr"}

Instead of using the technology to speed up mobile communications, however, Verizon is testing the service to be used in fixed wireless deployments to bring gigabit-speed internet to the home.\n\nThe move is another step by Verizon toward making its 5G service market-ready. The company is working with partners such as Ericsson, Intel, Qualcomm, and Samsung to conduct the trials, according to a press release. Verizon said that the following 11 cities will serve as test beds for 5G:\n\nAnn Arbor, Michigan Atlanta, Georgia Bernardsville, New Jersey Brockton, Massachusetts Dallas, Texas Denver, Colorado Houston, Texas Miami, Florida Sacramento, California Seattle, Washington Washington, DC\n\nSEE: Think 5G will be fast? It's nothing compared to terahertz internet\n\nThe companies that Verizon is working with on this trial are members of Verizon's 5G Technology Forum (5GTF). And, according to the release, the 5GTF has delivered a 5G fixed wireless specification that is \"immediately implementable.\"\n\n\"The 5G systems we are deploying will soon provide wireless broadband service to homes, enabling customers to experience cost-competitive, gigabit speeds that were previously only deliverable via fiber,\" Woojune Kim, vice president of the next generation business team for Samsung Electronics, said in the release.\n\nHowever, as noted by CNET's Roger Cheng, there isn't a clear path to becoming a pilot customer for the service just yet. Also, as Cheng wrote, there is no set specification for 5G available, so Verizon could be hoping to impact how that specification continues to develop.\n\nThe news of the trials comes shortly after Verizon announced its acquisition of XO Communications' fiber-optic network business earlier this year. The purchase helped bolster Verizon's efforts in 5G which, along with other forms of fixed wireless, could help remote workers, telecommuters, and rural businesses gain access to faster internet speeds.\n\nVerizon isn't alone in its wireless efforts, as AT&T recently announced trials for its AirGig 5G service as well. Google Fiber has also been experimenting with last mile wireless after its purchase of Webpass, and could be using it in the next iteration of its service in cities like Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers\n\nVerizon will be trialing its 5G fixed wireless service in 11 US metro areas sometime in mid-2017. The service won't be focused on mobile; rather it will be used to deploy fixed wireless and gigabit internet speeds to homes. Along with Verizon, both AT&T and Google Fiber have also been experimenting with fixed wireless and 5G technologies to advance their networks.\n\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Tech News You Can Use newsletter.

{"id": 981, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "We reported that persistent cannabis use was associated with neuropsychological decline, from adolescence to midlife (1). Two commentators suggested alternative explanations; we tested these and report the results here.\n\nRogeberg (2) wonders whether socioeconomic differences explain the association between cannabis and neuropsychological decline. His argument is based on his assumption that cannabis use is more common in youngsters of low socioeconomic status (SES). He also believes that the intelligence quotients (IQs) of low-SES children are temporarily boosted by schooling but that when they leave school and choose their own niches, their IQs rebound to their former low baseline. If many cannabis users were low-SES children, Rogeberg says this coincidence would create the false impression that cannabis use was responsible for their IQ drop in adulthood.\n\nRogeberg's (2) idea and simulated data are interesting, but actual data exclude the possibility that the IQ drop we observed was attributable to SES differences. First, adolescent cannabis users are not concentrated in the lower classes; cannabis is used by young people from all social strata. In the Dunedin cohort, low SES did not significantly predict adolescent-onset cannabis dependence (\u03c72 = 1.15; P = 0.56); only 23% of the adolescent cannabis users were from low-SES families (whose breadwinners had low-skill occupations such as foodpacker), making it unlikely that low SES explains why adolescent-onset cannabis users' IQs decline. Second, as previously reported (3), the IQ scores of children from low-SES families did not change from the beginning of schooling to adolescence, nor did they change from adolescence to adulthood ( ); in a critical test, low SES was unrelated to adolescent-to-adult IQ decline (r = \u22120.006; P = 0.86). These findings do not support the claim that low-SES children's IQs are temporarily boosted while in school and subsequently decline to baseline. Third, unsurprisingly, when we statistically controlled for SES, the association between persistent cannabis use and IQ decline that we reported (\u03b2 = \u22120.152; t = \u22124.45; P < 0.0001) remained unaltered (\u03b2 = \u22120.158; t = \u22124.58; P < 0.0001). We further restricted our analysis to study members who grew up in middle class families (whose breadwinners had occupations such as building inspector, aircraft mechanic), excluding low-SES families, as well as high-SES families (professional occupations such as dentist), thus precluding potential for low-SES confounding. The association between persistent cannabis use and IQ decline remained unaltered (\u03b2 = \u22120.155; t = \u22123.61; P = 0.0003) ( and ). Finally, we reported many different mental functions, including executive function, memory, processing speed, perceptual reasoning, and verbal comprehension (1). Some of these abilities are more susceptible to SES-related effects than others. If decline were attributable to SES, we would expect to see worse decline in those tests. The data did not fit this pattern, further excluding the possibility that the IQ drop is attributable to SES alone.\n\nIn a parallel fashion, Daly (4) suggests that conscientiousness, one of the Five-Factor Model personality traits (5), may explain the cannabis\u2013IQ decline association. Daly's idea is interesting, although his own test in the National Child Development Study disconfirmed his thesis about conscientiousness. Daly's test was hampered by two shortcomings in his data. His cannabis-exposure variable does not ascertain the essential features of exposure in our study, young age of onset or persistence. His predictor, personality, was measured after cannabis use (at age 50 y), placing putative cause after effect, in the wrong time sequence. Fortunately, the Dunedin Study is better able to test Daly's idea. Our previously published measure of childhood self-control (6), a precursor of conscientiousness, was assessed before cannabis use began. It was unrelated to IQ decline (r = \u22120.034; P = 0.31). We evaluated the association between cannabis use and IQ decline, controlling for childhood self-control. The association between persistent cannabis use and IQ decline that we reported (\u03b2 = \u22120.152; t = \u22124.45; P < 0.0001) remained unaltered (\u03b2 = \u22120.151; t = \u22124.38; P = 0.0001). These tests exclude the possibility that the IQ drop is attributable to initial differences in conscientious personality.\n\nObservational studies like ours cannot prove causation, and yet many important research questions, including whether cannabis alters cognitive function, are intractable to experimentation. It is unethical to randomly assign youngsters to use cannabis for years, to test whether such use impairs mentation. However, even if experimentation were ethical, it could merely show that cannabis has potential capacity to impair cognition. Only a"}

However it turns out that threatening to kill the founder of Valve, Game Newell isn't a particularly smart plan either, as the developer of Paranautical Activity, Mike Maulbeck found out after a Twitter rant, when Valve pulled his game from Steam.\n\nMaulbeck's social media attack against Valve didn't last for long, but has quite a bit of history. As Polygon points out, Paranautical Activity would have been on Steam last year, but due to it being in the Greenlight process, Valve didn't want anyone queue jumping, even if they could get a publishing deal with Adult Swim. Understandably, Maulbeck wasn't best pleased.\n\nThat resentment boiled over this week, when the developer \u2013 having changed his name to a Halloween themed, \"Murderbeck\" \u2013 found after finally making it out of early access, he couldn't publish on weekends. On top of that, it seems Valve continued to advertise the game in that state, even when it was finally given the go ahead.\n\nAnd then that led to this tweet:\n\n\nSource: Facepunch Forum\n\nValve's near immediate response was to pull the man's game from Steam, leaving Maulbeck to go through several stages of grief, most of it on Twitter. However he has received some support from people stating that it was clearly not an actual death threat and that Valve didn't remove the game from Steam because it would help prevent a murder, it did it as a punishment, something that some have questioned if Valve should be allowed to do.\n\nWhile Maulbeck has now said that he's unlikely to continue game development, due to needing the Steam sales platform to make a decent living. However he did say that if he ever made another game, he hopes \"steam doesn't have this awful f***ing monopoly anymore.\"\n\nIf you'd still like to buy Paranautical Activity, an FPS roguelike, with a Minecraft like aesthetic, you can buy it from the official site or through the humble store.\n\nDiscuss on our Facebook page, HERE.\n\nKitGuru Says: This is the danger of one dominant sales platform \u2013 you live or you die by it as a developer.

Specifically, they're pondering whether Archer can turn a half eaten hot dog and some scraps into a passable human finger with a class ring on it. Archer, like the team, has to work with what he can get. But this isn't a joke for an episode. Instead, the team is working out an entirely new way of watching TV, where after seeing Archer dodge mobsters, viewers can do his job for him and even get a prop from the show for your trouble courtesy of their new app, Archer, P.I.\n\nArcher follows Sterling Archer, \"the world's most dangerous spy\" as he blunders from one misadventure to the next, dragging along his coworkers as he does everything from oversee the discreet disposal of the Italian Prime Minister's corpse to a season-long arc where he became the worst cocaine dealer in the history of drugs. The show is packed with in-jokes, pop culture references, and other gags, and that quickly seeped into every crevice of the show: Going through the show frame-by-frame usually yields everything from obscure literary references to subtle nods to past events on the show.\n\nIn the sixth season, however, the animation team went further. What looked like random numbers on the profile of a spy the team was hunting turned out to be a hexidecimal code that led to a website. That website, in turn, quickly led fans down a bizarre rabbit hole into the psyche of Krieger, the possible clone of Adolf Hitler and a man with a love of Rush, bizarre Japanese pornography, and turning people into robots. That spawned a second scavenger hunt for the seventh season that saw clues littered all throughout the season, climaxing in fans uncovering a 3D printed file that earned them a prop from the show.\n\nBut this season, instead of looking for little clues in the background, the Archer team has invented an entirely new way of watching TV. To find out what Archer's up to when he's not on screen, you're going to take out your phone and solve mysteries yourself, in the craziest, most ambitious scheme the show's staff has hatched yet. To pull it off, they've had to invent new ideas on the fly and even write an entirely new season of the show after the episodes themselves have been completed. Here's a look at how it works, and how it might change TV.\n\nHow Background Jokes Became Groundbreaking Tech\n\nLike everything on Archer, its scavenger hunts started with background jokes. \"It was interesting to see people react to it, and then we began to hide stuff,\" Matt Thompson, the show's executive producer, tells us. \"We decided 'Let's give it to them! Let's get after it and figure out how tough we can make it.' It was crazy in its complexity.\" The gags were supposed to be just that, jokes, but unexpectedly, the hunts wound up winning Floyd County, Archer's production company, back-to-back Emmys for Outstanding Creative Achievement in Interactive Media in 2015 and 2016.\n\n\"We thought for this season we couldn't just do that again,\" technical director Bryan Fordney explains. So the team decided instead to take an ambitious jump. Instead of hiding codes and gags inside the episode, they'd use pioneering technology to turn everyone watching into a detective unearthing exactly what Archer is up to, in between the hijinks we see on screen.\n\nIn season eight, Archer, for reasons that will become clear once the season starts, is hopping back to the 1940s. Sterling Archer is now a PI, Cyril and Pam are LAPD, Lana is a chanteuse and possible femme fatale, and Krieger is\u2026 well, he's still a Nazi and a mad scientist. Like most private dicks, Archer has a case he's supposed to be working while he's really doing something else."}

Lacy Swing said the IOM was ready to help the government with Libya's own internally displaced people and work in migration centers.\n\nHe said Europe's migrant crisis has been aggravated by what he called \"unprecedented anti-migrant sentiment, fueled now by suspicions that some of those fleeing terrorism might be terrorists themselves.\"\n\nBut he urged governments to try to address the root causes of migration \u2014 conflicts, water shortages and big disparities between rich and poor countries.\n\n\"In my lifetime I have never known a situation quite like today, because you have nine armed conflicts and humanitarian emergencies from West Africa to the Himalayas,\" he said.\n\nHe said Europe needs to come up with a comprehensive plan on migration \"but I don't see it happening any time in the near future, but we'll do everything we can to support them on it.\"\n\nLacy Swing stressed that \"migration is not an issue to be solved, it's a human reality that has to be managed or governed.\"\n\n\"We know that historically, migration has always been overwhelmingly positive.\""}

That answer's obvious. The tougher one is, how to overcome the inertia and get on the road?\n\nMy husband Richard and I had steady jobs, a downtown condo, and great friends and family, but we realized that there was something missing in our lives and we weren't happy about it. We felt like zombies stumbling through our 9-5 jobs, living for the weekends and holidays. We are goal oriented and the next logical step in our lives was to have kids. Since that idea scared us more than anything we decided on a second option: leave our jobs, hit the road, see the world, and find glory (whatever that means).\n\nWe rented out our condo, sold a bunch of our belongings, stored the rest at our parents' house (thanks!) and saved as much money as we could before our self-proclaimed departure date. We hit the road on October 5, 2013, leaving from my hometown of Kelowna, B.C., and pointing our truck south. After a quick stop to BCAA for our travel insurance (see, we ARE responsible) we aimed for the first of many border crossings in Osoyoos, B.C. We will very vaguely follow the PanAmerican Highway with the eventual destination being the southern tip of Argentina \u2013 Ushuaia.\n\nDepending on our location, we wake up each morning in our rooftop tent to the sound of crickets, waves crashing, roosters crowing, dogs barking, or church bells ringing. As the sun rises we climb down the ladder of our new bedroom (a rooftop tent), open the tailgate of the truck, and boil water in a pot on our Coleman stove for coffee. Our new home is a 1990 Toyota pickup truck adorned with a solar panel, rooftop tent, and electric fridge. The bed of the truck is filled with Rubbermaid containers housing bathroom items, kitchenware, dry food, and extra blankets. Our entire life is now easily contained within these seven containers.\n\nFor days, weeks, and months we have driven south. We passed through apple trees in Washington State, the coastal rain of Oregon, the stunning mountains of Yosemite National Park in California, and finally crossed the border into Baja, Mexico. On the Baja Peninsula we camped on the beach, visited the cactus-filled deserts, and watched the incredible Baja 1000 off-road desert race all with nary a conversation with any drug cartel. Crazy. We crossed the peninsula back and forth multiple times, meeting generous locals, eating copious amounts of tacos, and thankfully dispelling the stereotype that the entire country of Mexico is dangerous.\n\nWe recently shipped our truck from the Baja peninsula to mainland Mexico and are currently smack dab in the middle of the country in the colonial town of Guanajuato. 12,000 kilometers of pavement, washboard, and gravel roads have passed us by and we are happier, healthier, and more passionate about life than we ever have been. Life on the road suits us\u2026that is a good thing because we expect to drive at least another 30,000km before reaching Ushuaia.\n\nPhotos by Richard Giordano.

So, without further ado, here are the rules inserts from all 7 existing decks.\n\nAnd going with the theme of past decks (and the fact we don't actually have any gaming-related cards written up for Creatures or Treasures) we've got a preview card from Location Cards. It's not new to all of you, but it is to the new backers.\n\nBe Well\n\n-Ste\n\np.s. We're in our last week, and not getting many new backers. A large part of this is that because of various events (that you don't need to care about) we've done far less promoting of this project than we'd planned. If you love Concept Cards, please share them with your friends, so that more people have the chance to pick up a set (and we'll be more able to come back and do more kinds in future :-D)\n\np.p.s. Speaking of sharing cool things, I recently came across a Fantasy Treasure Chest Kickstarter, also based in the UK. I'm picking up a couple for LARP purposes myself, and thought some of you might want to take a look.

{"id": 995, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "I read a lot of books. Most people don't read these days which is a damn shame. OK, I'll admit I went through a dry spell for a good block of time where I didn't read anything that wasn't force fed to me in Junior High and High School, but luckily for me I got back on the horse in college. I love to read books about psychology and thinking. I am a deep diver when I get into a topic of interest and this is both a blessing and a curse. I get fixated on whatever is in my cross-hairs. Always have, and this has pushed me into some pretty negative thought patterns in my day. I have inadvertently set a handful of bad habits this way which had to be undone later on. Most (close to all) of the unhappiness in my life, both past and present, has come from me not maintaining control of the voice in my head and allowing it to set bad habits in my way of thinking.\n\nI talk about that \"voice in your head\" quite a bit because that voice in your head is what governs the way you perceive your personal reality. Your \"reality\" that you experience is 100% subjective. No two people share the same exact reality. Quantum physics even tells us that there isn't even such a thing as a solid matter \"Reality\" with a capital R. There are only billions of \"realities\" (lower case r) rendered to each of us as we observe what is going on in our environment. Five honest people could witness the same car crash and give five completely different accounts to the police of how it played out. Each of them would believe their own account enough to pass a polygraph. So who's right? We have to let the judge and jury decide. But wait, even their views are completely subjective.\n\nYou don't attract what you WANT. Wants are intellectual in nature. Wants are in your conscious mind. You attract what you are in harmony with, what you ARE. And you ARE the sum total of your thoughts that become fixed in your subconscious mind. -Bob Proctor\n\nThe fact is we usually have little to no control over anything that happens around us in our life. We can exert a certain amount of control over our physical surroundings and we can manipulate people around us to a certain degree with some effort (if your into that sort of thing), but there is only one thing you can control. That is the way you respond. Lets face it, SHIT HAPPENS and you get to deal with it. Your habits of thinking directly govern how you respond. How you respond to things and the story you tell yourself in your own head is what determines your quality of life.\n\nHumans like all other animals are creatures of habit. But what exactly is a habit? Simply put, a habit is a usual way of behaving. Something that an organism does often in a regular and repeated way. Getting more into it, Merriam-Webster's medical definition says a habit is \"an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary by frequent repetition or physiological exposure.\" Our subconscious mind functions totally on habit.\n\nWhen we DO or THINK anything repeatedly our subconscious mind literally takes in the program just like a computer and then acts it out automatically without any further conscious effort. This goes for anything that you repeat enough times whether it is beneficial or detrimental to your quality of life. This is why it is so important to become aware of our inner thought processes and conduct routine audits. It's tough, but it's so important if you want to make any sort of change to your lifestyle. Any change that you attempt to make in your way of living whether it be physical, mental, or spiritual HAS to be a change made at the subconscious level. You must make it a lifestyle change that you repeat for long enough to adequately \"program\" it into the subconscious mind. You must make it an automatic way of being otherwise you will go right back to the undesired state.\n\nThe chains of habit are often too weak to be felt until they are too strong to be broken. -Warren Buffett\n\nI like the way Earl Nightengale talks about the subconscious mind as a garden. The garden will grow any seed you plant in the fertile soil whether the plant be a medicinal herb or a deadly poison. The garden will return whatever you plant, but it doesn't care what you plant. A garden will also go to weed and be eaten by intruders rather quickly if you don't properly protect and tend it. This is why it is of utmost importance to make sure you are only planting what you WANT to see grow up tall and bear fruit. Only set habits that will be beneficial to our quality of life and lead to our physical, mental, and spiritual advancement. All three of these go hand in hand and they all work with the same universal habit force.\n\nI was listening to a lecture last week that almost brought me to tears because of how beautifully the person talked about"}

Sometimes they catch a glimpse of the next big pickup truck, while other times they see something that doesn't quite fit. These shots fit into the latter category. Clearly someone is trying to be clever here with the Ford Super Duty, not wanting anyone to see inside or apply any magnets to the inner bed walls. We wonder why that would be. Here's the latest information our covert operators sent to us:\n\n\"You see here that the two-door regular-cab Super Duty has a uniquely camouflaged rear section that caught our attention, and looked like it could be the first full-size two-door SUV we've seen in a long time, almost like the famous two-door Bronco involved in the infamous O.J. Simpson 'low-speed chase.' Once the prototype passed by, and we had a chance to inspect our photos more closely, it looks like Ford had decided \u2014 for some unknown reason \u2014 to camouflage a rear bed cap on a Super Duty prototype.\n\n\"It's the first time we can remember Ford camouflaging a rear cap in this manner, which raises some questions. Is this some all-new bed cap designed specifically for the next-gen Super Duty, or is it just a normal cap? The camouflage seems tailor-made for this particular application, and it successfully hides anything that could make it special. The cap has a badge on it from a familiar cap maker \u2014 ATC Truck Covers \u2014 along with some grease pencil writing that makes it look like a pretty traditional transaction. So why the camouflage? We haven't a clue. Maybe it's simply to hide the contents or details of the truck bed. But the full vinyl wrap seems like overkill.\n\n\"Whatever the explanation, the prototype Super Duty and its camouflaged cap is a bit of an anomaly among Ford's now-familiar Super Duty test trucks.\"\n\nKGP Photography images"}

{"id": 998, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Cyclocross is the new buzzword for those of us that live a life on two wheels - everyone wants to get in on the action. Only four or five years ago a CX-specific bike was a difficult beast to find outside Europe, and once you managed to track one down it was an expensive proposition indeed. Things have changed fast, and now every major manufacturer is churning out an entire CX fleet every season.\n\nIf you've just been bitten by the CX bug, or just want a sturdy commuter bike that's also fun to play with on the singletrack, what should you look for?\n\nBefore we get into specifics, let's have a look at what makes a good 'Cross bike.\n\nGenerally, CX frames resemble their road counterparts with some tweaks to the frame geometry that make riding in the dirt more feasible. Look for a raised bottom bracket to give extra ground clearance over rocky terrain, as well as making it easier to negotiate tight turns while pedaling. Cables should be re-routed to prevent mud build-up, and the top-tube underside should be re-profiled to make carrying the bike easier. The frame geometry itself is often slightly longer and more relaxed to improve comfort and stability over uneven ground, and the brake hoods are often positioned higher on the bars to allow the rider more control (and to keep their weight closer to the back wheel to prevent wheel-spin). Bars are generally higher than on their roadie counterparts, and stems are usually shorter to provide more control in the mud and sand. Weight and aerodynamics take a back seat to durability and control.\n\nSo basically, it's a stronger, tougher road bike with disc brakes (most of the time) that's been dressed up with gnarly tires and clever cabling to keep the muck out.\n\nBecause cyclocross bikes need to be strong, there really aren't any super low-budget deals to be had, even at entry level. No point buying a $500 CX bike if it's just going to break, right?\n\nHowever, there are some great bargains out there - the 5 bikes we've listed here are not only excellent value for money, they've all been raced extensively in the toughest proving grounds around the world.\n\nDepending on where you are in the world, the CruX comes standard with either a Shimano 105 or SRAM Apex groupset - either way you're sitting pretty, as this bike is set up nicely to get you through the nastiest terrain out there in style. With its race-optimized geometry, tapered headtube, internal cable routing, and a super-stiff frame, the CruX also boasts CX-specific gearing that provides consistent and reliable shifting in all conditions. It has outstanding stiffness-to-weight ratio to power through the nastiest courses. Fully hydraulic disc brakes offer precise braking performance in the worst 'cross conditions, while Specialized Tracer Sport tires provide the perfect tread to cover any course, with serrated shoulder knobs to adapt to hard or loose terrain.\n\nPriding itself on front and rear axles, the new Focus Mares is a beautiful-looking bike. Focus claim that the wheels, with their threaded through-axles (similar to the front axle found on most 29-inch MTBs), are quicker to change than their traditional quick-release skewered counterparts, and if that's true then it's a real breakthrough. Either way, it looks uber-cool. The bike comes with a SRAM Apex groupset and disc brakes, and its triple-butted aluminium frame is paired with a T4 carbon front fork.\n\nIts ride is smooth and stable for a CX bike, and the high bottom bracket and upright fork angle add considerable clearance and control. Overall, a great bike.\n\nThe Taiwanese manufacturer has come up with a great CX bike that is set up for racing but is affordable enough to be an excellent introductory 'Cross bike. It features Shimano cranks set up with 'cross specific 46/36t chainrings, and they're matched up to a Shimano 105 11-speed 11-28t cassette at the rear, which is perhaps the most common ratio setup found on cyclocross bikes today. The frame is well-proportioned and sturdy, and sitting atop it is one of the most comfortable saddles going around, the manufacturer's own Merida Sport 5. The seatpost, stem and handlebars are borrowed from their range of road bikes but are perfectly adequate, and the Maxxis Mud Wrestler 33 tires are gnarly and provide excellent traction. Overall, it's a great bike at a great price.\n\nKona's iconic Jake the Snake is back - its butted 7005-aluminum frame is light, fast, and offers a snappy ride, while engineered seatstays and a tapered full-carbon fork take the sting out of rough terrain.

So, I prayed for a job. God laughed and gave me far better than I could have ever asked for.\n\nI applied for several jobs. They were all full-time positions as an administrative assistant to municipal employees, like town administrators, police chiefs, and town planners. I would have been positively awesome at any one of those jobs, but nary a phone call did I receive.\n\nPaint me discouraged. Paint me sad. I prayed. I asked God to help me get one of the \"perfect\" jobs. I really did. I could practically hear Him laughing out loud.\n\nHaven't you ever heard the saying, \"If you want to hear God laugh, tell Him your plans?\" Perfect example here.\n\nI did have the forethought and wisdom to pray this (mostly), \"God if this is the best opportunity and the right place for me to be, please open that door. If not, don't open that door and I'll keep looking.\"\n\nThat is NOT an easy prayer to pray. I really, really, really wanted at least one of those jobs. The hours were good, the locations were good, the pay - oy the pay- was GREAT. Heavy sigh.\n\nNo one called. No one wanted an employee that was just returning from an 11 year hiatus, regardless of the fact that I had kept all of my office skills quite current.\n\nOuch.\n\nIn the back of my brain was a former employer that had said to me more than once, ' \" If you can ever come back and work in the office, come see me.\" ' That's a huge deal for me, but I didn't go back out of respect for him.\n\n\"WHAT?\" you say. That former employer was/is a windows and doors supplier for new construction and remodels. Anyone taken a good look at how the housing industry has been in the last 6-8 years? Yea, not pretty.\n\nSo, out of respect for that employer, I didn't waltz into his office last spring and basically \"call-in\" that invitation to come back there. I just couldn' t do it.\n\nLast fall, I changed my mind. I'd been out on my bicycle in the neighborhood and saw several houses being built. I'm talking lots of houses where there had been NONE just months before. I had also been hearing the promptings of the Holy Spirit saying, \"What about Searls? Don't you think it'd be a good idea to waltz back in there and ask about a job?\"\n\nSo, waltz I did, and they hired me back. Turns out, they not only survived the housing collapse, but are doing quite well, thank you very much!\n\nI had prayed for the right opportunity, and this is what God did:\n\nI asked for a full-time job.... I got a part-time job.\n\nI asked for awesome pay... I got totally fair pay for the job I do and the industry I'm in.\n\nI asked for great location... I got a job 6 miles from my home.\n\nI imagine you're thinking, \"How is THIS far better than what you asked for?\"\n\nHere's how - the transition from being a full-time mom/wife to being a gainfully employed mom/wife has been brutally difficult.\n\nI have yet to figure out how to balance all the household duties, mom duties, wife duties along with being out of the house up to 3 days a week for as much as 7 hours a day. Had I been employed full-time, I'd probably be losing my marbles right now.\n\nThe great location, the flexibility and better yet, the amazingly awesome people I work with and for, make having this job better than anything I could have asked for. I get calls and emails that say \"can you work on [this] day?\" I can say yes or no. If I can work, but only until a certain time, or only after a certain time, it's OK.\n\nIf I want to take a week of vacation, I just tell them I'm going on vacation. If I want to keep volunteering at my church, they not only let me, but they encourage me to do so. If one of my kids gets sick, or needs me, I can leave. If something happens at home, I can go.\n\nThey've been marvelously patient while I learn everything I need to know. They are encouraging and helpful. The are pleasant, kind, caring people that I thoroughly enjoy working for and with. There isn't enough pay in the world to cover the value of these things.\n\nI didn't really know what I wanted or needed,"}

I think that actually helps the plot in this case, where too much skulduggery could seriously bog things down. There are secrets and conspiracies though, and enough adventure to keep the pages turning. I would recommend this to people who intend reading the whole series. It's blatantly obvious that some loose ends are only going to be resolved right at the very end. Like I mentioned, I wasn't sure how to approach this review. I couldn't help but feel it might have been better to wait until I've finished book seven. On the other hand, by then I would likely have forgotten what I wanted to say in the first place.\n\n\nAnyway, I'll not go into plot details. This series has a large following, it seems, and most folk likely already know what it's about. It is Fantasy, with just the slightest touch of Mechanical Sci-Fi (if that is even a term).

(Annie Gowen/The Washington Post)\n\nDuring the long weeks soldiers from two of the world's largest armies camped on their doorstep, officials in the tiny Buddhist kingdom of Bhutan maintained a meditative silence.\n\nGovernment leaders resolutely declined to comment, and even the Bhutanese media largely refrained from covering the standoff, which began in mid-June when Indian troops crossed into a remote plateau claimed by Bhutan and confronted Chinese soldiers preparing to build a road there.\n\nWhen the respective armies began withdrawing from the Doklam area Monday, the Himalayan nation of just under 800,000 finally exhaled, and analysts said that its temperance had helped defuse tension between the two nuclear-armed powers.\n\nFor years, Bhutan \u2014 a landlocked nation squeezed between the Tibet plateau to its north and India to its east, south and west \u2014 has trod a delicate balancing act between China and its great patron, India, which trains its soldiers, buys its hydroelectric power and gives it $578 million a year in aid.\n\nIn the country's capital of Thimphu, India's influence can be seen everywhere \u2014 from the army officers jogging on its streets to the laborers on Indian projects to build mountain roads.\n\n\"Bhutan is really caught between two sides, and the confrontation at Doklam has brought everything to the surface,\" said Nirupama Menon Rao, India's former foreign secretary and ambassador to China. \"Bhutan has played this game of survival for a long, long time. Nobody does it better than them.\"\n\nBut the dispute caused many in Bhutan to call for the country to reevaluate its close \u2014 some say suffocating \u2014 relationship with its southern neighbor.\n\n\"If India's border closed tomorrow, we would run out of rice and a lot of other essentials in a few days. That is how vulnerable we are,\" said Needrup Zangpo, the executive director of the Journalist Association of Bhutan. \"Many Bhutanese resent this.\"\n\nThe country \u2014 with stunning mountain passes, rippling Buddhist prayer flags and ancient temples \u2014 was until recently a monarchy, its villages isolated from much of the world for most of the past century. Television arrived in 1999, and even now, only about 60,000 tourists from outside the region visit each year, paying a hefty $250-a-day visa fee during the high season.\n\n\nThe tiny Himalayan nation of Bhutan was thrust into an international showdown as militaries from China and India were locked in a two-month standoff on a remote plateau in territory claimed by both Bhutan and China. (Annie Gowen/The Washington Post)\n\nIts beloved and progressive fourth king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, set the country on the path to democracy in 2008 during his rule and popularized the \"gross national happiness\" indicator, which rates quality of life, preservation of culture and environmental protection over economic output. In a 2015 study, more than 90 percent of residents said they experienced some level of happiness.\n\nBhutan's long ties with India, by far its largest trading partner, were cemented in 1958, when India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, traveled through the mountains on a yak. The two countries already had agreed, in a 1949 treaty, that India would guide its foreign policy; the terms were softened and modified in 2007.\n\nBhutan has an ongoing border dispute and no official diplomatic ties with China, and India has frowned upon any change in this status quo. India cut off a cooking gas subsidy in 2013 because, some analysts said, it feared Bhutan's then-government was growing closer to its northern neighbor. India has long seen Bhutan as an important ally against Chinese expansionism in the region.\n\n\nA man spins a prayer wheel at the Memorial Stupa in Thimphu. (Annie Gowen/The Washington Post)\n\nThimphu is a still-quiet valley town, dotted with traditionally painted homes and apartments, that has modernized rapidly in the past 10 years and recently began having traffic jams.\n\nMany of its younger, educated residents \u2014 who followed the China-India conflict on their mobile phones, via social media \u2014 said that the weeks-long standoff had raised questions about Bhutan's place in the world and whether the country was being well served by maintaining such a close relationship with India while holding China at arm's length.\n\nMany of the tenants of Thimphu TechPark, a government-owned business park that opened in 2011 as a symbol of the country's aspirations, took a pragmatic view of China \u2014 saying they see it as a potential marketplace for fledgling Bhutanese entrepreneurs.

However, since Gary Solon's 1999 Chapter in the Handbook of Labor Economics, the literature has taken an interesting turn. In addition to focusing on obtaining precise estimates of correlations and elasticities, the literature has placed increased emphasis on the causal mechanisms that underlie this relationship. This chapter describes the developments in the intergenerational transmission literature since the 1999 Handbook Chapter. While there have been some important contributions in terms of measurement of elasticities and correlations, we focus primarily on advances in our understanding of the forces driving the relationship and less on the precision of the correlations themselves.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMachine-readable bibliographic record - MARC, RIS, BibTeX\n\nDocument Object Identifier (DOI): 10.3386/w15889\n\nPublished: Recent Developments in Intergenerational Mobility, in Handbook of Labor Economics, Orley Ashenfelter and David Card, editors, North Holland Press, Elsevier, 2011.

{"id": 1004, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "By Arthur Weinreb and Micah Naziri Since the George Zimmerman verdict a little more than a week ago, many in \"White America\" have been struggling to come up with any explanation for why the acquittal in the killing of unarmed 17 year old Trayvon Martin was not racist. Recently, many \"Racists In Denial\" seem to believe that they have found a parallel example of an African American version of George Zimmerman. Roderick Scott, acquitted of killing 17-year-old white teen Christopher Cervini is the new internet sensation of any Caucasian who innately supports the Zimmerman verdict, but is somehow convinced that it is not for racial reasons. But just ow similar was this case to the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin case? Photo: Greece New York Police mug shot?\n\nRoderick Scott, an African American man, shot and killed Christopher Cervini, a 17-year-old white youth, in 2009.\n\nScott faced a charge of first-degree manslaughter, and claimed he shot the teen in self defense.\n\nScott was subsequently acquitted.\n\nAll this happened in New York State, which, even back then, had much tougher gun and self defense laws than the state of Florida has.\n\nWhat are the legal similarities and differences between this case and the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman case? As you will see, from start to finish, the cases are worlds apart.\n\nThree Teens Breaking into Cars\n\nDuring the early morning hours of April 4, 2009, 42-year-old Roderick Scott was asleep on the couch of his Greece, New York home, just outside of Rochester. He was awakened by some noise outside.\n\nScott looked out the window and saw three teens attempting to break into his car. He grabbed his gun, for which he had a legal permit, put it in his waistband and told his girlfriend to call 911 before going outside.\n\nWhen Scott went out, he confronted the youths, who were going through a neighbor's car. According to Scott, he told them to stop and wait for the police. The incident ended after Scott fired two shots at Christopher Cervini, killing him.\n\nWhat Happened? Accounts Differ\n\nAccording to 15-year-old James Cervini, one of the three, and Christopher's cousin, Scott shot Christopher after the teen yelled, \"Please don't shoot me, I'm just a kid.\" Scott, who testified in his own defense, said he only fired after Christopher came running at him in a threatening manner.\n\nScott's attorney, James Parrinello, argued it was likely Christopher went at Scott to give James a chance to get away. James was already bound by two probation orders and the consequences of being charged with breaking into cars would have been more serious for him.\n\nScott, we must remember, was on his own property, defending his own property originally, from three individuals \u2013 not one \u2013 who were actively engaged in undisputed criminal behavior.\n\nScott Originally Charged with Murder\n\nUnlike George Zimmerman, Scott was immediately arrested after the shooting and charged with murder. A grand jury later reduced the charge to first-degree manslaughter. The jury deliberated for about 19 hours before rendering a verdict of not guilty on December 18, 2009. If you have never heard about this story it is because Scott was arrested and had to essentially prove his innocence, just as we have come to expect from the corrupt so-called \"Justice\" system.\n\nManslaughter and Self Defense in New York State\n\nUnder section 125.20 of the New York Penal Law, first-degree manslaughter is defined as when a person intends to cause serious physical injury to another person and causes the death of that person or a third party. First-degree manslaughter also applies to cases that would otherwise constitute murder but the defendant, at the time the act was committed, suffered from extreme emotional disturbance.\n\nIt is clear that at the time Scott fired two shots into Cervini, he intended to cause serious physical injury to Cervini. He would have had to have been convicted of manslaughter unless the killing was justified.\n\nUnder New York law, deadly physical force is defined as the use of force that can reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical injury. Under section 35.15 of the New York Penal Law, deadly physical force is justified if the person who uses it has a reasonable belief that the other person is using or is about to use deadly physical force against him or her.\n\nIn New York, the use of deadly physical force is not justified if the defendant is not in his or her dwelling and they have an opportunity to safely retreat from the situation. The New York Penal Law is similar to the law of Florida in terms of the onus of proof. A defendant need not prove a killing is justified and the jury must acquit unless they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not justified.\n\nThis killing, however, was proven to have been justified."}

One personnel director told Garafolo that Bamiro had a fifth- or sixth-round grade.\n\nThe confusion began when the 6-foot-8, 335-pound tackle was denied a waiver from the NCAA for another year of eligibility, even though he was planning to play a fourth season at the New York college this fall. He had already been named to a preseason FCS All-American team, anticipating his return.\n\nBut the NCAA declared him ineligible because he attended the University of Pittsburgh in 2008 but didn't play football. He transferred to Stony Brook in 2009 and redshirted, and played the last three seasons there, earning All Big South honors last year.\n\nBamiro is being represented by former NFL lineman Bill Conaty, and he's training with former Eagles tackle Tra Thomas.\n\n\"He's huge. He has hands twice the size of mine, and I'm 6-3,\" Conaty said. \"The biggest thing teams love about him is he can bend well. At that size, being able to bend well and redirect is huge. His ceiling is a lot higher than most people's.\"\n\nTechnically speaking, Bamiro was eligible for the regular draft in April, only no one knew it at the time.\n\nSo now, he'll work out for NFL teams Thursday, hoping to land a spot without going through the draft process at all.\n\nPhoto credit: Newsday.com"}

{"id": 1015, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Citizenship, and pathways to citizenship, should not be for sale\u2014it is too valuable. Citizenship is sacred.\n\nCan You Buy A Canadian Citizenship? Almost\n\nThere was a myth circulating in the deeper reaches of the internet that one could buy a Canadian citizenship from the Province of Quebec, assuming you were rich enough. Or so I thought it was a myth. As it turns out, it's just about true. It is entirely possible to essentially purchase Canadian Permanent Residency status, that is the level just beneath Canadian Citizenship, through something called the Quebec Immigrant Investor Program. I'll explain how this dubious bureaucratic quid pro quo transaction works in a moment, but first, what is the difference between Canadian Permanent Residency and Canadian Citizenship?\n\nFrankly, there's not much of a difference when it comes to everyday life. Permanent residents are able to work most jobs (excluding those with high level security clearances), live and travel anywhere in Canada, and are able to collect most forms of government welfare. The main difference is that permanent residents cannot vote, do not carry Canadian passports, and may have their legal status revoked should a judge deem it necessary (if they commit a heinous crime, let's say). Although in most cases, permanent residency status leads to citizenship, and is rarely revoked\u2014even for violent offenders. So before moving on, let's be clear: you cannot buy a Canadian citizenship from Quebec, but you can buy the next best thing, permanent residency status\u2014this usually leads to Canadian citizenship. The Quebec Immigrant Investor Program allows foreign investors to acquire Canadian permanent residency status by investing CAD $800,000 in the province of Quebec, either through a financial intermediary (a bank) or through direct investment (setting up or buying a business). This $800,000 is guaranteed by the Quebec government\u2014it's a certain investment. This is bizarre if your goal is really to attract investors. Investing is inherently risky.\n\nAlthough the program is capped at 1,900 immigrants, people with an \"intermediate\" knowledge of French are exempt from the quota. That is, the real number of immigrants entering through the program could be significantly higher than the cap, given that those who speak French are not counted towards said quota. Of course, the cap does not include family members either. If we assume that the average immigrant family consists of five individuals (two parents, three children), this means at least 9,500 people are entering Canada per year through Quebec's program. And again, it could be much higher depending upon how many French-speakers are applying. Another interesting point of fact is that the quota limits the number of accepted applicants from China, Hong Kong, and Macao at 1,330 (again, not including family). This suggests that the program was likely being swamped with rich Chinese immigrants abusing the system\u2014otherwise why impose such a specific cap in the first place? Beyond this, it is also worth mentioning that Quebec is a French-speaking province. If French-speaking immigrants are not counted towards the quota, this means that the 1,900 person cap is really a cap on English-speaking immigrants, who probably don't want to stay in Quebec to begin with. When looking at the system as a whole, its purpose becomes clear: Quebec is selling Canadian permanent residency statuses to English-speaking, predominantly Chinese investors, who have no intention of settling in Quebec.\n\nContinued below... The impact of this is clear in cities like Vancouver, which are magnets for Chinese investment. Now let's get back to the money: what does Quebec get out of this? Well, they get the $800,000 investment. But that's a naive way of looking at it: Quebec could easily finance identical investments by issuing bonds. Over the course of five years the interest on said bonds would amount to roughly $70,000. By getting foreigners to invest, this saves Quebec some $70,000 in interest payments. Basically, Quebec makes $70,000 per immigrant\u2014that is the cost of Canadian legal status. I suppose you could argue that Quebec is gaining business experience, and high net worth residents, but at what cost? As the American experience with the mass immigration of physicians shows, it is possible to have too much of a good thing. Citizenship, and pathways to citizenship, should not be for sale\u2014it is too valuable. Citizenship is sacred.\n\nOnly YOU can save CFP from Social Media Suppression.

{"id": 1016, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Here's a cautionary tale. In 2011, Marvel Comics launched a new Alpha Flight title which was, more or less, exactly the book fans wanted. It tanked after nine issues.\n\nWhat the hell?\n\nAlpha Flight is a late Bronze-Age superhero concept of a team of exclusively Canadian superheroes, and Wolverine's original team before the X-Men. Effectively the brainchild of John Byrne, Alpha Flight had a very distinctly Canadian team, sort of an Avengers with a Canuck flair (every character was from a different province, and each dabbled in different parts of Canadian culture\u2014for poutine's sake, one of them was a Sasquatch). It really was one of those oh-so-Marvel titles rooted in classic Byrne creativity, and a staple part of the company's shared universe. Yeah, they were kind of third-rate, but the original series managed to run a respectable 130 issues, and a few experimental sequel series in the years after.\n\nOne of Alpha Flight's problems is that the series kept straying from its roots, and the original team in their original form was never quite reunited. We always ended up with a number of awkward or ersatz versions of the team, and classic members kept getting killed, resurrected, and killed again (including Brian Michael Bendis very unceremoniously killing them before the first Civil War). The Avengers, Fantastic Four, and X-Men usually have a \"core\" team that the book always revolves around, but Alpha Flight always seemed to miss the mark.\n\nThe 2011 revival series by Greg Pak and Fred Van Lente essentially got the book back to that core concept with the original team of Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, Sasquatch, Puck, and the others reunited. There were some minor upgrades to the team's appearance, and the characters had to deal with some loose ends from the past 30 years of Alpha Flight continuity, but otherwise, this book was gold. It was exactly the comic Alpha fans had been clamoring for with two creators who we knew would take care of them, some decent Dale Eaglesham art, a tie-in to Fear Itself (the 2011 Marvel summer event), and a guest-appearance by Wolverine. The book was as close to mainstream superhero gold as it could get.\n\nAnd it tanked. The sales just weren't there, and Marvel killed it.\n\nThis kind of thing happens all the time at comics companies, even the big two. (I'm going to pick on Marvel a lot here, but DC also has this issue.) We can generally agree that some books are \"objectively\" better than others and some books are more worth of cancellation of others. But regardless, unless a title is a \"core\" book, it's probably going to end up on the chopping block at some point. There's almost certainly going to be a Spider-Man or Avengers or Batman type book on the shelf every month, even if the number of those books expands and contracts. But your Moon Knight or Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat, probably isn't going to last a year or two in this day and age.\n\nEvery so often, fans lament these books killed too soon with a \"WHY????\" as if it's some grave injustice on the part of the industry, the publisher, and the readership for not letting a \"great\" book last longer. This complaint seems to get all the louder if it's a \"diverse\" title with a female or minority lead.\n\nI'm going to suggest a radical concept here: comic books get cancelled because that's life.\n\nI certainly don't blame anyone who's upset when a favorite title gets shelved and it the market doesn't notice what we see in our hearts. We see great art, great story, important concepts, and something that resonates with us which the rest of the market just isn't getting. They're off reading their X-Men or whatever it is the kids are into these days. (Although, let's be fair\u2014today's Top 20 books are probably legitimately earning their place. Tom King is on Batman, Marvel's Star Wars line sells well for obvious reasons, and The Walking Dead is a cultural staple right now.) But when you have over 300 titles competing for the top 20 spot, 280 of them aren't going to make it.\n\nThis would probably take a significant amount of research, but I would wager that upwards of 90 percent of all comic books ever published have been cancelled (subtracting out books which go through revamps and relaunches, like Spider-Man's various forms). This tends to be true across all of business, though: most new restaurants and small businesses eventually fail, and few movies ever light the box office on fire anymore.\n\nMarvel, if you think about it, does this all the time: it publishes a substantial amount of product, and statistically, most of it eventually fails. Why?"}

The entire park and trail system is named the \"606,\" after the first three digits of city zip codes.\n\n\"People are really clamoring to get up there,\" said Beth White, director of the Chicago regional office of the Trust for Public Land, a non-profit conservation group which has led efforts to fund the project. \"People have been dreaming about it since the 1990s, when most of the freight service went away.\"\n\nThe cost of the park and trail system is $95 million. U.S. Transportation Department clean air funds provided $50 million, private donations $20 million and the city and county about $5 million, White said. The trust wants to raise $20 million more.\n\nTaking inspiration from Manhattan's successful High Line trail, cities across the United States have been converting old rail tracks, roads and bridges into urban parks. Washington is set to open 11th Street Bridge Park in 2018.\n\nChicago's Bloomingdale Trail was conceived long before the High Line opened in 2009, and, at 2.7 miles, is about twice as long, White said. It will allow bike and stroller traffic on its 14-1/2-foot-wide surface.\n\nThe trail will also serve as an alternative transportation corridor, linking four working- and middle-class neighborhoods with 80,000 residents. It connects to \"L\" stations, a Metra rail station, bus routes and Milwaukee Avenue, a popular thoroughfare for bike commuters.\n\nThe idea for the trail grew out of neighborhood talks about the need for more parkland on the city's Northwest Side, White said. After train traffic stopped, the area was used by adventurous teens, homeless campers and dog walkers who scrambled up the sides of the embankments.\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel, who has supported building bike trails, pushed for the 606, and construction started in August 2013.\n\nInterest in the trail has led to worries that gentrification could drive away poorer neighbors.\n\nIn response, Emanuel set aside funds to create nearly 700 affordable housing units within a mile of the 606, and proposed requiring developers to include such units if they want city help to build."}

Serving static assets is a pain in Node, it's not something it focuses on and everybody advises you to setup a static server using NGINX or implement a cache proxying using Varnish or Squid. The biggest advantage that these servers have is that they support sendfile for sending static assets and is generally agreed upon that this is \"The Best\" method for sending static data. But Node doesn't have this advantage, it's removed from the core \"due to reasons\" and the only way to get decent file serving performance is to do aggressive caching of the assets in memory to reduce I/O operations as well as optimize for cache hits inside the browser or using conditional requests. And that is the goal of this project, cache all the things!\n\nBuild status\n\nPlease note that the build status only displays the status of the GitHub master branch. New stable versions are only released once the master passes all tests.\n\nFeatures\n\nVersions comes with tons of features to make it easier for you to set up a simple static server. We try to support as many features as a normal paid CDN would provide for you.\n\nOrigin Pull\n\nIn addition to serving files from disk you can also configure versions to pull static content from an origin server. This way you don't have to upload you static assets to a separate server in order to get them cached.\n\nSet caching headers for files\n\nIn order to reduce the amount of HTTP requests that a browser would do for your files, versions automatically sets the appropriate caching headers. This way you assets will be served from the browser cache instead of the server.\n\nAdvanced gzipping\n\nGzip is enabled on every compatible file format, even if the origin server doesn't support gzip. In addition to that, we have disabled gzip for IE 5 and IE6 without service pack 2 as it is known to improperly cache it. We also have detection for obfuscated gzip headers as researched by the Yahoo performance team.\n\nREST API for managing your server\n\nYou can communicate with the server using a REST API. You can inspect items from the cache, see what keys are cached or flush the server. The possibilities are endless.\n\nMetrics\n\nEverybody loves stats, that's why we are gathering metrics about the requests and the state of the server. These metrics can be accessed through the REST API.\n\nClient API\n\nVersions comes with a dedicated client that can communicate with it's REST API's or through Pub/Sub.\n\nSynchronisation\n\nSynchronises configuration and versions number between different connected consumers to ensure that they are all hitting the same cached version.\n\nLove\n\nIt's crafted and engineered with love, what else do you need?\n\nInstallation\n\nInstallation is done through the node package manager (npm)\n\nnpm install versions --save\n\nThe --save tells npm to automatically add this file to the dependencies object of your package.json file.\n\nAPI references\n\nThe API references are generated from the source's JSDoc comments:\n\nConfiguration\n\nThe server can be configured in 2 different ways or a hybrid of both. It has a dedicated configuration file called versions.json that lives in the root of your application folder (the application folder is the folder that contains your node_modules folder). But you can also configure the module through a chainable API. And the last would be a hybrid of those. Using a configuration file and using the API to override some of the configuration values.\n\nauth The auth property is a simple security token that you can use to secure your versions REST API. After setting this property it requires an ?auth= parameter to be used to access the API. <pre>versions.set('auth', 'Sup3rSecr3tP4z5w0rdy0');</pre> blacklisted extensions Black list extensions that you do not want to have pulled from your origin server. You can for example black list .conf files or maybe some other random files. Please note that people can still fetch these files directly from the origin server. <pre>versions.set('blacklisted extensions', ['.conf', '.log', '.gz']);</pre> cors Set custom Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers. The default value is * so all values are allowed. If you only want to allow access from a specific domain set the domain here. <pre>versions.set('cors', '*.example.com');</pre> directory A directory that is relative to the module that required versions that is used to serve static content. If you want this directory to be relative to a different path. You can set a root property. <pre>versions.set('directory', './public');</pre> force extensions Only allow files with an extension to be pulled from"}

The one you likely know is that the US was caught by surprise when it found the Soviets had succeeded at launching an artificial satellite on Oct. 4, 1957. Within months, Americans made a series of investments, including the creation of NASA, to catch up and eventually beat the Soviets in the space race. The upshot: even though Soviets breached space first, a little more than 10 years later, it was Americans who were the first (and still only) humans on the moon.\n\nThe other story is more complicated. The US government's reaction to Sputnik's launch was subdued. Its spy planes had been monitoring Soviet developments, and it's likely they knew a launch was imminent. \"So far as the satellite itself is concerned, that does not raise my apprehensions\u2014not one iota,\" declared Dwight Eisenhower, US president at the time.\n\nEven though Eisenhower had publicly declared that Americans were working towards launching small satellites two years earlier, in 1955, his administration was worried that going first would expose the country's advanced military rockets to the Soviets. That's why, two months after Sputnik, on Dec. 6, 1957, the first American attempt to launch a satellite used the non-military Vanguard rocket.\n\nBut you know about the first story, because it's the narrative that won. Sputnik caused hysteria among Americans, who had relaxed into believing that they were technologically superior to the communists. If a Soviet satellite could fly over US skies, then surely Soviet nuclear missiles could unleash fury on US soil.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Vanguard launch was a failure and it was watched on televisions across the country. To the American public, and their representatives in the US congress, it seemed they were losing to the Soviets, and so far behind that they might never be able to catch up.\n\nMoscow understood the power of using science and technology for propaganda, and wielded it effectively with Sputnik. But Washington was not going to take it lying down. Apart from the creation of NASA, Eisenhower also created the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) to specifically ensure there would be no more technological surprises, and congress passed the National Defense Education Act to overhaul the country's public school science curricula and get more Americans to attend college.\n\nOver the next decade, the country poured money into beating the Soviets in space, edging out ahead in the mid-1960s. Consider that nearly 5% of the country's budget went to NASA alone at the space agency's peak.\n\nTo most readers today, the word \"propaganda\" is a pejorative. In its pure sense, however, the term simply means \"to advance a cause.\" The US may not have as strong an adversary in Russia today as it did in the Soviets during the Cold War, but American politicians and government agencies continue to use science and technology for propaganda.\n\nFor instance, NASA's dwindling coffers have forced it become more innovative in communicating the importance of its work and seek more funding. Through giving voice to its rovers, NASA has become adept at winning the internet. Or when vice president Mike Pence wants to drive home his boss's motto to \"make America great again\" by promising, in a speech on Oct. 5, to send Americans \"back to moon\" and gain space leadership \"once again.\"\n\nThe US, though, is already a leader in space by a big margin. What it, and the world, really needs is a Sputnik moment for terrestrial problems. As Earth tumbles towards the precipice of catastrophic climate change, we need to find an adversary in global warming that can only be beaten through working together. Just like Americans felt the urgency of needing to deal with the nuclear threat from the Soviets. The world needs to fear for the generations to come if we aren't able to do anything to mitigate global warming. As the Soviets and later the US taught us, the power of propaganda can be effective if we are ready to wield it."}

While it's true that Newton still has some growing up to do, specifically with how he responds when things go wrong on the field, this was too much - and it had plenty of people pretty sure that Newton's race was a factor in how harsh Nawrocki was.\n\nWell, now Nawrocki's back with a scouting report of Geno Smith, the former West Virginia QB generally thought to be the top signal-caller available this year - a scouting report seemingly written to assure us all, \"Yeah, Cam Newton's race was a factor, if not the factor, in how harsh Nawrocki was.\" Let's see what he has to say about Smith, shall we?\n\nNot a student of the game...Not committed or focused \u2014 marginal work ethic.\n\nHarsh. But not necessarily written because Smith is black, right? Maybe that assessment is right on. We'd better get a second opinion. A second opinion from someone who knows Smith inside and out, like, say, his quarterbacks coach at WVU, Jake Spavital:\n\nSpavital said the thing sets Smith apart is obsessive film study and relentless work ethic...\"Geno, football is all he cared about. He'd take the O-line out to eat and then come back to the office and we'd watch stuff on the iPad. He was always trying to improve. I've never seen anybody study harder with the tape than he does.\"\n\nOh. Um. Well, then. So whose word are we taking: Nawrocki's, or the guy who's worked up close and personal with Smith these last couple years? I know who I'm taking, but maybe you think this is just a coach pumping up one of his guys. So how about we look at another Smith draft scouting report, this one from the National Football Post (which, by the way, isn't exactly glowing - it doesn't give Smith a first-round grade):\n\nSimilar to Andrew Luck and RGIII, Smith is exceptionally smart with great intangibles/character and work ethic. [...] Based on all the great things NFL scouts told me about Geno's character, leadership, work ethic and intangibles, I was very excited to evaluate his play.\n\nAnd how about the opinion of another draft scout?\n\nIt's one thing to not like a prospect. It's another to make things up about their character or work ethic. Looking at you, Nolan Nawrocki. \u2014 Matt Miller (@nfldraftscout) April 1, 2013\n\nTrollin' Nawrocki is at it again - and, judging by the amount of reaction he's stirred up - including, of course, the post you're reading right this second - it's some mighty effective trolling. So from that standpoint: good job, Trollin'. Joke's on us, we guess. From the standpoint of actually providing worthwhile insight on a prospect, though: well, let's just say we're starting to think Nolan Nawrocki isn't a student of the craft of evaluating quarterbacks.\n\nGetty photo, via"}

A week later, early in the morning on Feb. 15, the mentally ill homeless man was found dead in a Rikers Island jail cell that four city officials say had overheated to at least 100 degrees, apparently because of malfunctioning equipment.\n\nThe officials told The Associated Press that the 56-year-old former Marine was on anti-psychotic and anti-seizure medication, which may have made him more vulnerable to heat. He also apparently did not open a small vent in his cell, as other inmates did, to let in cool air.\n\n\"He basically baked to death,\" said one of the officials, who all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to discuss specifics of the case.\n\nThe medical examiner's office said an autopsy was inconclusive and that more tests were needed to determine Murdough's exact cause of death. But the officials, all with detailed knowledge of the case, say initial indications from the autopsy and investigation point to extreme dehydration or heat stroke.\n\nAdvocates for mentally ill inmates in New York say the death represents the failure of the city's justice system on almost every level: by arresting Murdough instead of finding him help, by setting bail at a prohibitive $2,500 and by not supervising him closely in what is supposed to be a special observation unit for inmates with mental illnesses.\n\nDepartment of Correction (DOC) spokesman Robin Campbell said in a statement that an internal investigation will look into all circumstances of Murdough's death, \"including issues of staff performance and the adequacy of procedures.\"\n\nCampbell acknowledged that the temperature in Murdough's cell was \"unusually high\" and that action has been taken to fix mechanical problems to ensure safe temperatures, \"particularly in areas housing vulnerable inmates.\"\n\nMurdough's 75-year-old mother, Alma Murdough, said she did not learn of her son's death until the AP contacted her last week, nearly a month after he died. His public defender was told of the death three days after the inmate was found, the DOC said.\n\nJason DeCrow, AP\n\n\"He was a very lovely, caring guy,\" said Murdough, adding that her son had bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and that she had not seen him in about three years.\n\n\"He had beer problems. Drinking beer. That was his downfall. Other than that, he was a very nice guy.

{"id": 1033, "ended": true, "length": 678, "text": "Every once in a while, an opportunity arises to do the right thing, the common sense thing.\n\nRight now, US Attorney General Eric Holder has such an opportunity. He is \"reviewing\" the federal government's options for dealing with the nettlesome fact that two US states have now enacted laws legalizing and regulating the personal use of marijuana.\n\nFaced with a similar problem with those several states that have legalized medical marijuana use, Holder and the US attorneys in those states have essentially declared war on cannabis dispensers. They have gone so far as to deploy the heavy hand of the federal government to threaten landlords with seizure of property used for dispensaries operating in accordance with state and local laws. And all this is occurring despite President Obama having suggested the government has better things to do with its limited resources than prosecute medical marijuana businesses and users.\n\nNow, Attorney General Holder \u2013 and ultimately, his boss, the president \u2013 have to come to grips with the reality of two states whose voters have decided that modern-day Prohibition should end. Interestingly, President Obama carried both Washington and Colorado on the same ballot on which the marijuana legalization measures appeared. That shouldn't matter, but \u2026\n\nAs the attorney general maneuvers through this problem, it is important to remember why it is, in fact, a problem. Unlike the failed and ultimately rejected prohibition of alcohol in the last century, allowing states to permit the legal use of marijuana does not involve violating or repealing a constitutional amendment. The federal government has a problem simply because marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 substance under the Controlled Substances Act \u2013 the same law that lets the government decide that one painkiller requires a prescription and another doesn't.\n\nThat simple classification, and the myriad state laws that have resulted from it, have turned millions of Americans into criminals and empowered murderous cartels \u2013 in the same way that Prohibition empowered Al Capone and an entire generation of organized crime. Voters in Washington and Colorado looked at those realities, and quite reasonably decided that the questionable benefits of treating marijuana use as a crime do not justify the considerable and unmistakable costs.\n\nThose voters didn't stage a coup. They didn't defy the US Constitution. And they didn't incite a rebellion. Rather, they just made a perfectly rational policy decision.\n\nNow, the Attorney General has an opportunity to do the same. Beyond the oft-stated arguments regarding whether marijuana use should be illegal, or legal and regulated like alcohol, the attorney general has the remarkably American option of invoking the notion of a limited central government and cutting the states of Washington and Colorado some slack to make their own decisions about what is, reasonably, a state issue.\n\nI am among those who have called upon the Attorney General Holder and President Obama to remove cannabis from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act. They have the authority to do so, and it just makes sense. In the meantime, I would argue they have the discretion to choose not to challenge the duly enacted laws of two states whose voters have made a reasoned decision about marijuana policy \u2013 a decision that in no way threatens any other states or the fed's precious authority.\n\nI urge Attorney General Holder to do the right thing. Colorado and Washington have taken courageous steps to end another failed Prohibition. Holder doesn't have to like that decision; he just needs to stay out of the way."}

And two since.\n\nThe Lombardi Trophy replica is in the lobby of the American Family Gate on the east side of Lambeau Field. It weighs 14.5 tons with a foam and metal infrastructure, and according to Dan Gokey of Insane Paint in Marinette is the largest structure ever to be chromed.\n\n\"The Lombardi Trophy is the ultimate symbol of excellence,\" Packers President Mark Murphy said during a ribbon cutting for the American Family gate and unveiling of the trophy. \"As coach Mike Holmgren said, every team wants to win the trophy, but it means more to us.\"\n\nThe trophy will be lighted at night and visible from South Oneida Street. It will be visible from two floors of the new Packers Hall of Fame, scheduled for completion in summer 2015, including from a replica of coach Vince Lombardi's office. It also will be visible from the new Lambeau Atrium restaurant scheduled to open in summer.\n\n\"We felt we needed a beacon on this side of the stadium,\" Murphy said. \"The Lombardi Trophy is a great source of pride for our fans and the Packers organization.\"\n\nThe trophy was built by Foam by Design of Clearwater, Fla., in seven major and three smaller pieces. It was shipped to Neenah, where Gokey assembled a 16-member crew at a Miron Construction facility to chrome the pieces. It took them 10 weeks.\n\n\"I assembled a crew from across the United States,\" Gokey said. \"We were working 7 days a week, 15 hours a day, living in hotels.

Marc Larson/Press-Gazette Media)\n\nGokey, who owns Insane Paint with his wife, Jamie, said the first question he was asked about the project was whether it could even be done.\n\nThe American Family Insurance Gate, off the east parking lot north of the Oneida Nation Gate, is one of three added to the stadium in the last three years as part of Lambeau Field expansion and renovations. Murphy said that on non-game days in particular, most Lambeau visitors park in the east lot, so the new gate will be welcomed.\"I didn't know if it could be done, but I wanted to do it for my home. I'm a Packers fan,\" he said. \"I'm always trying to do the next biggest thing. This will be hard to top.\"\n\nThe lobby around the trophy is adorned with Vince Lombardi pictures and quotes. Escalators lead to all floors of the Atrium\n\n\"I don't think there's ever been a coach in the NFL that's had a bigger impact on society or the league,\" Murphy said of Lombardi.\n\nThe sponsorship with American Family Insurance of Madison runs through the 2023 season.

Some of my friends changed skirts in the washroom. It's totally OK,\" she said.\n\nMore than 27,000 women wearing short skirts visited the park in July and August last year, Huang said.\n\nBut many people say the policy is inappropriate.\n\n\"I'll never allow my wife or sister to wear such short skirts for cheaper tickets,\" said Zhang Quan, 33, of Guilin. \"It sounds bad to me, maybe because I'm a bit of conservative.\"\n\n\"The discount requirement is optional for female tourists, and it doesn't violate any laws in China.

He then brought out a carton of the freshest, most pristine white button mushrooms I had ever seen. Sold! Freshly steamed asparagus, corn straight from the cob, spring peas and my favorite in-season, sweet Vidalia onions round out the vegetables. For the pasta, I chose Farfalle (also known as \"bow-tie\" pasta). I like a more substantial pasta for this particular dish.\n\nI steamed the asparagus while working on sauteeing the onions, mushrooms, peas and corn in a vegetable broth. I really love Imagine brand because they not only offer a low-sodium version, but it has a deep, rich flavor and color.\n\nTo create the light cream sauce, I used about a half a cup of canned coconut milk, a tablespoon of lemon juice and a vegan parmesan. Now, if you don't want to use the commercially available vegan parm (or can't find it), another great and tasty option are grated walnuts. You can take it one step further and mix the walnuts with nutritional yeast, a pinch of salt and perhaps, garlic powder.\n\nCombine everything in the pan, taste for seasoning and garnish with fresh parsley, a squeeze of lemon juice and a sprinkle of vegan parmesan.

{"id": 1048, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Fresh from winning voter approval of a $3.5 billion bond measure, BART is looking at asking for another $1.5 billion as part of a bridge-toll increase that could go on Bay Area ballots as early as next year.\n\nThe idea being pushed by BART and other transit agencies is to raise tolls on the Bay Area's seven state-owned toll bridges \u2014 that's every one of them except the Golden Gate \u2014 by $1 to $3. Officials are still haggling over the exact amount, but the upper range would boost the top cost of crossing the bay in a car to $9.\n\nThe full list of transit projects that would get the money isn't finalized. But BART is already planning to push its way to the front of the line and ask for as much as a third of the toll dollars that the measure would generate.\n\nIt was just three months ago that BART won a high-stakes campaign to persuade voters in Alameda, Contra Costa and San Francisco counties to approve Measure RR, a bond issue that will pay for a host of nuts-and-bolts improvements to the nearly five-decade-old system. This next ballot bid would be called Regional Measure 3 and would go before voters in all nine Bay Area counties, probably in 2018.\n\n\"Rebuilding our transportation system is similar to maintaining a house \u2014 it's really never done,\" said Randy Rentschler of the Bay Area Toll Authority, which would have a major say over how the money raised by the new measure would be divvied up.\n\nBART says what it needs most is 306 additional railcars. There's no money in Measure RR to pay for them, and they'll cost a lot of cash \u2014 $1.6 billion, to be exact.\n\nBART hopes $1 billion of that will come from the envisioned toll-increase measure, which would still leave it $600 million short of what it needs for all the cars. That money would have come from sales-tax hikes on the November ballot in San Francisco and Contra Costa counties, but voters there fouled up BART's plans by rejecting the increases.\n\nThe 306 new railcars BART hopes to purchase are on top of the 775 already on order as part of the replacement of its aging fleet.\n\nOther BART priorities for the toll money include $250 million to modernize train control and traction power systems and $90 million to design a seismic retrofit of the 3.6-mile Berkeley hills tunnel.\n\nAlso on the list is $120 million to pay for \"capacity enhancements\" at the heavily used Embarcadero and Montgomery Street stations in San Francisco. BART would use half the money to install automated sliding glass doors on the platform that would keep riders safely separated from the tracks, and the other half to add elevators, escalators and stairs.\n\nNone of this can happen until the Legislature gives the OK for Bay Area voters to decide on a bridge-toll increase. State Sen. Jim Beall, D-Santa Clara, is expected to introduce legislation that would do that, according to those following the process. Beall's office declined to comment Tuesday.\n\nBay Area voters last approved a $1 increase on local toll bridges in 2004, to pay for congestion-relief measures. Transit officials have since imposed two $1 toll hikes on their own, for bridge seismic retrofits.\n\nMeasure RR in November was no easy sell, because BART had to persuade two-thirds of voters to give the thumbs-up to pass it. A toll hike wouldn't be as big a challenge \u2014 it would require only a cumulative simple majority in the nine Bay Area counties.\n\nBART wouldn't be the only transit agency benefiting from the toll hikes. Money probably would also be spent on ferries, express buses, high-occupancy-vehicle lanes and even the new Transbay Transit Center in San Francisco, which has already received $300 million in toll revenue.\n\nAs for justifying BART's grab of toll dollars, transportation officials argue that the rail system carries an average of 28,000 people each weekday rush hour \u2014 nearly twice the number that move in cars over the bay.\n\n\"This is very real congestion relief, which is capacity improvement,\" said Nick Josefowitz, a BART Board of Directors member from San Francisco who helped lead the campaign for Measure RR.\n\nAccording to BART spokesman Jim Allison, the bond measure that voters approved in November covers a bit less than half the cost of a new, $915 million train control system that will allow 30 trains an hour to travel under the bay, six more than now.\n\nBut a bit less than half isn't enough \u2014 which is why BART is extending its hand to voters, again.\n\nSan Francisco Chronicle columnists Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross appear Sundays, Mondays and Wednesdays. Matier can be seen on the KPIX TV morning and evening news. He can also be heard on KCBS"}
{"id": 1049, "ended": true, "length": 920, "text": "Canadian producer Bob Rock, who has been responsible for some of the biggest rock and metal albums of the last 30 years, including all of METALLICA's studio output during the 1990s and early 2000s, says that he doesn't foresee himself ever working with the band again, explaining that \"they've gotta continue to move forward.\"\n\nRock first teamed with METALLICA for the band's self-titled 1991 album (a.k.a. \"The Black Album\"). The Elektra set debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and stayed on the chart for 281 weeks. Rock helmed METALLICA's subsequent albums, through 2003's \"St. Anger\".\n\nDuring an appearance on VH1 Classic \"That Metal Show\" co-host Eddie Trunk's podcast, \"Eddie Trunk Podcast\", Rock was asked if he would ever consider working with METALLICA again. \"I just don't see it happening,\" he responded. \"I think they've gotta continue to move forward. I think [with 2008's] 'Death Magnetic' [album], they went back to their roots, which is great. And I think they've got a landmark record in them, and it's probably brewing right now.\"\n\nRegarding what his relationship with METALLICA is like nowadays, Rock said: \"I see the guys, [and] it's like the day after when I see them.\"\n\nStory continues after advertisement\n\nHe added: \"When you spend fifteen years with somebody, and [you've] kind of gone through all the things they've gone through and I've gone through, they're a big part of my life \u2014 period.\"\n\nRock, 60, told Reuters in 2006 that he felt \"20 years younger\" after his split with METALLICA, whose last studio effort, \"Death Magnetic\", was helmed by Rick Rubin.\n\nDuring the making of 2003's \"St. Anger\", a petition that some 1,500 fans signed subsequently was posted online calling for METALLICA to dump Rock, claiming he had too much influence on the band's sound.\n\n\"The criticism was hurtful for my kids, who read it and don't understand the circumstances,\" Rock told Reuters. \"Sometimes, even with a great coach, a team keeps losing. You have to get new blood in there.\"\n\nMETALLICA co-manager Peter Mensch argued that Rock \"nursed METALLICA out of almost complete collapse on that record. Bob is one of the five best producers on the planet. But it was time to shake things up.\"\n\nAsked what his opinion was of \"Death Magnetic\", which featured a return to METALLICA's thrashier roots but was marred by accusations that the record was botched in the mixing process and sounds distorted, Rock told \"Eddie Trunk Podcast\": \"I get where they went, and they had to go there.\"\n\nIn a 2006 interview with Revolver magazine, METALLICA drummer Lars Ulrich stated about the band's decision to work with Rubin on \"Death Magnetic\" after spending 15 years and making five albums with Bob Rock: \"In 1990, when we started using Bob, it was because Bob made all the best rock records that were going on at that time \u2014 M\u00d6TLEY CR\u00dcE, DAVID LEE ROTH, THE CULT \u2014 and he was involved in the engineering of all the BON JOVI records. Everything that was going on in the late eighties was all about Bob Rock. And now, everything that's great about rock \u2014 from SLIPKNOT to SYSTEM OF A DOWN to the [RED HOT] CHILI PEPPERS to MARS VOLTA, and even the Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond records \u2014 it's all Rick Rubin. The same thing that brought us to Bob 15 years ago is now kind of bringing us to Rick. We want to work with the guy who's got the total finger on the pulse. And Bob was the first one to bless it, to say, 'Look, I don't know what else I can offer you 15 years later.' We finish each other's sentences. We know what he's going to say, and he knows what we're going to say. We made, what, like, five records with him? And he really had been the fifth member of our band for the last 15 years. As painful as it is, getting his blessing first was really important to us.\""}

Woo Kyu-min of the LG Twins blew 13 saves in 2007.There were plenty of questions when Lim was included on Ryu's final 24-man roster, along with LG Twins closer Bong Jung-keun, who has blown four saves of his own this season.But Lim had four consecutive saves to convince Ryu that he deserved a place on the national team, then promptly squandered two of three save opportunities. After the Wednesday game, Lim was 5-2 with 22 saves and a 5.08 ERA.His eight blown saves lead the league, two more than a group that includes Lee Yong-chan of the Doosan Bears, Bong and Yoo Won-sang of the Twins. All three are going to the Asian Games.The closer position was one of the biggest problem areas for Ryu when filling the national team roster. KBO closers such as Sohn Seung-rak of the Nexen Heroes (2-3/23 saves/4 blown saves/4.42 ERA) have been struggling throughout the season.Ryu chose Lim because of his big-game experience in international competitions such as the World Baseball Classic and the Olympics.But Lim isn't the only concern for Ryu. The starting rotation of Kim Kwang-hyun (SK Wyverns), Yang Hyun-jong (Kia Tigers) and Lee Jae-hak (NC Dinos) is a huge question mark.Tigers ace Yang is predicted to start either in the semifinals or final game if the team qualifies in the preliminary rounds. The lefty starter had a great first half with a record of 9-4 and a 3.67 ERA, but his ERA in six second-half starts is 5.67 and he has shown signs of fatigue and problems with his control. Over the past three years, Yang threw an average of 84.3 innings a season due to a series of injuries, and this year he has pitched 129. Regardless, Tigers Manager Sun Dong-ryeol can't afford to give his ace a little extra rest when the team is in a battle to make it to the postseason.After being named rookie of the year in 2013, Dinos' side-arm pitcher Lee, who is predicted to be the team's third starter to go against weaker opponents, was selected for the national team. In five starts in July, though, he picked up two wins and had a 5.55 ERA. For the season, he is 9-4 with an ERA of 3.91.Hanwha Eagles rising star Lee Tae-yang is expected to be utilized as a fourth starter or swingman, but his performance in July was another disaster as he went 1-4 with an ERA of 10.33 in six games.His ERA has skyrocketed to 5.42, from 3.55 at the end of June.\"The question is whether Manager Ryu has a backup plan, which must be difficult,\" said analyst Kim Jung-jun. \"The league continues until five days before the event kicks off [Sept. 20]. It seems like not enough time for tired players to regain their stamina.\"BY kwon sang-soo [sakwon80@joongang.co.kr]"}

Few seldom make it past the drawing board; fewer still make it to a full sized car. It takes a certain blend of foolishness and determination to build a car from scratch. But if you can persevere, you get a car; a unique and lasting artifact of your youthful foolishness, a reminder of what it means to never give up on a dream.\n\nI grew up in Southern California. I was a nerdy kid, pouring through car magazines, building models, and dreaming of cars. Living only a few miles from Shelby's factory, Paxton Superchargers, and So Cal hot rods, it was the perfect place for a car crazy kid.\n\nIn 1978, most of my friends were hopping up Mustangs and Camaros. If you had some money you spent it on hot rodding your car (traction bars and Supershop goodies) or going to the beach to meet girls. Quirky car nuts like me took a chance on something exotic like an Alfa or Fiat. There were no cell phones, ipods, X boxes, or cable TV distracting you from the main goal in life\u2026fixing cars and driving them. Well, OK also to meet girls.\n\nBy the time I was 17, I had purchased and re-sold a few cars with the goal of saving enough money to buy a Maserati or Ferrari. But another plan haunted me, to design and build my own car. I found a few copies of \"Car Styling\" magazine demonstrating how to use plaster, and our local library had books on fiberglass molding techniques.\n\nIt all seemed hauntingly simple; you get a donor car, strip the metal and then drop your newly formed body over the top and voila \u2026new car, just like building the plastic AMT and Monogram models lining my bookshelves. I started drawing and planning, then built crude models. Dad, a fellow car nut, encouraged me to plan as much as I could on paper before spending any money.\n\n1969/1983 Pegaso American Twin Turbo\n\nIn February 1979 I met Bill Miller, the owner of the 1953 Pegaso \"Thrill\" and former owner of the Bill Miller Special as featured in a recent FF article. One day Bill and I started sharing ideas for building a new car. I showed Bill some drawings and we decided to start a full sized build. Neither of us really new where to start but Bill had some experience with racing cars and had run a machine shop so he knew his way around casting and fabrication. Between the two of us we had a running start on some of the technical aspects, but the design was something different.\n\nBill and I liked the look of classic 60's sports cars so we decided on a car with a familiar but fresh \"look\". Retro before retro was \"in\". The theme became \"what if Pegaso had built a car to compete with the very first super cars \u2013 the Ferrari Daytona and Lamborghini Miura.\"\n\nWhat followed were several stages of development until deciding on a fiberglass, mid-engine layout with fastback styling. Bill and I were fans of the Muira, Pantera, and Italian coachbuilt cars so we worked in this genre. The first thing we did was layout a body centerline and five main section planes made from half inch bent metal wire.\n\nOnce we had the basic layout of the body we covered it in chicken wire and began laying plaster. After a few days we discovered that plaster and chicken wire was a mistake.\n\nIt never stopped warping. Concurrently we purchased a 914 from a junkyard and pealed away all the body panels and much of the inner structure. We adapted brakes, wheels and tires, and installed a Buick aluminum V8 with four Webers.\n\nThis drivable platform and wire form body seduced us into thinking we were months away from a completed car. It was summer of 1979 and I had just been accepted to study at UCLA. \"What a great car to drive to campus\" I dreamily thought. Little did I know I would earn a bachelors degree sooner than completing this car.\n\nReturning to the study of the warping chicken wire body, Bill and I took a closer look at other car design books. We needed a solid buck to form the body. We built a skeleton from plywood and Celutex, which was bendable but rigid enough to make the basic form of the body.\n\nWe increased the number of section planes until we had a solid 'car-shaped' loaf of car-shaped bread made up of wood and Celutex slices.\n\nWe then skim coated the contours in plaster, like icing a cake. This method worked far better than the chicken wire, however, when summer had passed and the rains began"}

Three weeks later, her body was found. Buzz60\n\nSydney Loofe was last seen on the evening of November 16. (Photo: FBI via Twitter)\n\nAuthorities have recovered the body of a Nebraska woman whose disappearance after a Tinder date last month triggered a massive search and bizarre social media posts from two persons of interest in the tragic mystery.\n\nLincoln Police Chief Jeff Bliemeister said Tuesday that \"analysis of digital evidence\" led authorities to a body in rural Clay County they believe is that of Sydney Loofe, 24, who vanished three weeks ago.\n\n\"We do believe that there is evidence of foul play,\" Bliemeister said.\n\nBliemeister expressed a \"strong belief\" that the body is that of Loofe, who was reported missing Nov. 16 after failing to show up at her job at a Lincoln home improvement store. He said formal confirmation would be made in the coming days.\n\nBliemeister provided no further details on the cause of death or circumstances surrounding the discovery. Investigators had been using Loofe's cellphone signal to retrace her movements in the hours before she disappeared.\n\nMore: Police: Missing Florida teen found safe in New York\n\nMore: Hunter charged in killing of neighbor while shooting after sunset\n\nLoofe's parents, George and Susie Loofe, acknowledged their daughter's death on their \"Finding Sydney Loofe\" Facebook page.\n\n\"It's with heavy hearts that we share this most recent update with you all,\" the couple said. \"Please continue to pray for Sydney and our entire family. May God grant eternal rest unto thee. We love you Sydney.\"\n\nBliemeister said the persons of interest, Aubrey Trail, 51, and Bailey Boswell, 23, remained in custody but had not been charged in the case. Both apparently left the state in the days after Loofe disappeared and were arrested Thursday near Branson, Mo., on unrelated charges.\n\nSocial media posts indicate Loofe went on a date Nov. 15 with Boswell, who has confirmed on social media that she met Loofe via the dating app Tinder.\n\nBoswell and roommate, Aubrey Trail, 51, live in the eastern Nebraska town of Wilber, about 40 miles south of Lincoln and the last place Loofe was seen alive. Trail and Boswell posted videos on social media last week proclaiming their innocence and claiming their efforts to speak with Lincoln police had been largely rebuffed.\n\nBoswell, wearing a hoodie and sunglasses in a video, said she dropped Loofe off at a friend's house after their date and never heard from her again. Bliemeister said authorities thus far have been unable to confirm Boswell's timeline.\n\nTrail said on his video that he \"wasn't running from anything.\" He said he was praying for Sydney and wished the best for her family.\n\n\"We're continuing to speak with Aubrey Trail and we'll continue to do so as long as he's willing,\" Bliemeister said Tuesday.\n\nBliemeister said police believe that there is no continuing threat to the public. But he provided no motive for the murder and stressed that no one had been charged.\n\n\"By their own statements on social media, we believe that Aubrey Trail and Bailey Boswell were two of the last people to see her before her disappearance,\" Bliemeister said. \"Thus they remain persons of interest.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2nvPwxp"}

Whatever your political persuasion, it's hard to think of a ritual more despised than the annual filling of the government's coffers. And it's not just in the United States where people complain. While the level of taxation is a topic of major political debate in nearly every country, the level of taxes that go unpaid gets far less attention.\n\nThe World Bank estimates the size of the global \"shadow economy\" \u2014 money intentionally hidden from view for the purposes of avoiding tax, including out and out tax fraud \u2014 amounts to more than 18 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP). A report by the British NGO Tax Justice Network (TJN) calculated that this amounts to more than $3 trillion in lost tax revenue per year. \"It's a crime against the people,\" argues Richard Murphy, the accountant and economist who prepared the report, noting that tax evasion by wealthy individuals and corporations often shifts the burden of paying for public services or debt repayments to the poorest members of society.\n\nHere's a look at some of the most striking examples of tax evasion around the world. Unless otherwise indicated, all statistics are from TJN's 2011 report, \"The Cost of Tax Abuse\":\n\nUNITED STATES\n\nSize of shadow economy: 8.6 percent of GDP\n\nEstimated money annually lost to tax evasion: $337,349,000,000\n\nThough the size of its shadow economy is small by global standards (by way of comparison, rising power Brazil's is a whopping 39 percent of GDP) in absolute terms the world's largest economy is also the world's biggest loser to tax evasion. At over $300 billion, the lost tax revenue from the U.S. shadow economy exceeds the total funding allocated for Medicaid in 2010. According to Murphy, lax regulation of corporations is the main culprit in the United States.\n\n\"How the U.S. regulates corporations is a massive problem. You [the United States] are creating so many corporations, you have no idea who owns them so you have no idea who should be taxed on them,\" he says. \"They come and go [from the country] for almost no expense. That is probably the biggest single opportunity for tax evasion in your economy but a blind eye is turned to it.\"\n\nThe revelation that presidential candidate Mitt Romney has as much as $8 million invested in funds based in the Cayman Islands \u2014 a popular tax haven \u2014 has generated some publicity for the issue of offshore financial shelters, which are legal under U.S. law but often used to facilitate illegal tax evasion.\n\nBOLIVIA\n\nSize of shadow economy: 66.1 percent of GDP\n\nMoney lost to tax evasion: $3,727,000,000\n\nBolivia is hardly a major player in the world economy, but the Andean nation has the unfortunate distinction of having the world's largest shadow economy, by percentage of the total economy. According to TJN's calculations, the shadow economy is 419 percent of total healthcare spending in South America's poorest country.\n\nPresident Evo Morales's left-wing government has attempted to crack down on the rampant tax evasion by corporations in Bolivia. As tax revenues account for only 13.3 percent of the country's GDP, Bolivia remains heavily dependent on loans from other countries and international agencies. It is working to pay down an external debt of more than $7 billion. Tax evasion is so rampant that even some government-run companies have been cited for cheating.\n\nRUSSIA\n\nSize of shadow economy: 43.8 percent of GDP\n\nMoney lost to tax evasion: $221,023,000,000\n\nTax evasion is serious business in Russia. According to one study, as many as 60 percent of Russian firms use so-called \"spacemen\" \u2014 short-term firms set up for the purposes of concealing assets \u2014 in order to avoid paying taxes. On average, the amount of taxes that Russian firms pay is equal to 40 percent of the taxes they do pay. These even include state-owned firms like the energy export monopoly Gazprom, which is estimated to have transferred more than $2 billion to \"spacemen\" in 2003-2004.\n\nUnfortunately, on the occasions that the Russian government does try to crack down on tax evasion, it's usually to make an example out of an oligarch who has fallen out of favor with the Kremlin, such as former Yukos Oil CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In 2012, the Russian police took the unusual step of filing posthumous tax evasion charges against attorney Sergei Magnitsky, who died under suspicious circumstances in police custody in 2009 after testifying about official corruption in a massive government tax refund scheme.\n\nITALY\n\nSize of shadow economy: 27 percent of GDP\n\nMoney lost to tax evasion: $238,723,000,000\n\nItaly"}

Critics say Trump's not-so-subtle attack on Heidi's looks was un-presidential and uncalled for.\n\nThey're wrong.\n\nThe first point to be made is that Trump didn't start the wife-baiting. Make America Awesome, a Trump-opposing PAC founded by the mannish Liz Mair, started circulating a particularly raunchy image of Melania Trump, urging GOP primary voters to back Cruz. While Cruz didn't authorise the ad himself, it was retweeted by many of his supporters. As always, the super PACs acted like a ninja assassins for its candidate. \"It wasn't me, your honour \u2013 it was those dastardly, nefarious PACs!\"\n\nFeminists call this sort of behaviour slut-shaming. I call it sexy-shaming. I'm really not sure what's achieved by pointing out that your opponent has an attractive wife. Isn't that a sign of success? Indeed Melania isn't just a great beauty: she's proven herself to be eloquent and willing to speak up about immigration, and she is the only non-dwarf (sorry Jeb) spouse to have gone through legal immigration, unless you count Ted Cruz himself of course.\n\nIs there any reason to attack her looks, besides the jealousy of women who apparently have neither looks nor brains?\n\nTrump's critics have accused him of being over-the-top in his response. Surely, say his critics, insulting a rival's wife for being too ugly is simply crass, classless, and rude.\n\nI agree. It's all of those things. But that's a good thing.\n\nFor decades, politics has been a competition of grievance. Politicians and activists win public sympathy by pretending to be hurt and offended. Those who are the most convincingly wounded win the day \u2014 and it's the left, the masters of faux-offendedness, who tend to beat the competition.\n\nTrump's crass tweets and objectionable comments may not be comfortable reading for old-fashioned conservatives who appreciate decency and good manners, but they are helping to break the language codes that were primarily set up by the left, for the left. Trump is destroying old notions of what's acceptable and unacceptable to say, and the primary losers of his new paradigm will be left-wingers and establishment types.\n\nIf Republicans learn anything from the unbelievable failure of Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, it should be that \"presidential\" and \"nice\" don't go together. Isn't it strange that elections follow the same rules as dating? Nice guys finish last.\n\nRepublicans typically reject the \"everybody gets a trophy\" mentality that has invaded our culture, but if you insist, we can add up to the attractiveness quotient of Cruz's wife and all of his alleged mistresses and compare the total with Melania. That ought to at least earn him a participation trophy.\n\nTo beat Hillary, Republicans must focus on getting more people under the tent, which means snagging Democrats. Would Trump gain the support of blue-collar working Democrats by tearfully apologizing to Cruz after the senator's minions attacked his wife? He could actually alienate them with that behaviour. Outside of the D.C beltway, respect is gained by standing up for yourself, and punching back twice as hard. You also need balls to tame the beast of political progressivism. Trump is facing attackers from all sides. GOP establishment members planning convention shenanigans to steal the nomination, RINOs like Rick Wilson promising to vote for Hillary Clinton over Trump, and Soros-funded goons from Black Lives Matter and MoveOn planning attacks on the democratic process. The Donald knows that the best defense is a good offense, and that's exactly the style we need to win the election.\n\nTrump isn't just changing politics, he's changing culture. The grievance wars have created a daily reality of fear for people who fall foul of the hyper-offended, even when the offense is unintentional. When actor Drake Bell cracked a joke about calling Caitlyn Jenner \"Bruce,\" he faced an internet lynch-mob of people who were offended on Jenner's behalf and was forced to apologise.\n\nTaking offense is a sort of one-upmanship. If you're offended, especially on behalf of an allegedly \"marginalized\" group, it signals you're a part of the educated, progressive elite. This, from people who've never read a book outside 2 years of a Gender Studies degree.\n\nThis is the consensus that's prevailed in politics and culture for more than a generation. There are only two significant forces that are putting up a fight against it: the anonymous pranksters of the internet, who reside on websites like 4chan and 8chan and delight in deliberately offending people, and Donald Trump"}

Rather, Post bit into his $325,000 burger in front of an invitation-only crowd of journalists, chefs, and food enthusiasts in the heart of London.\n\nThe strangest part wasn't the cost or the crowd but the meat. Post, a professor of vascular physiology at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, grew the burger himself. Not from a cow on his farm, mind you, but from a bovine stem-cell in a petri dish in his lab. Post's research, partially funded by Sergey Brin, one of Google's co-founders, has the potential to upend conventional wisdom on the environmental, animal welfare, and health impacts of meat eating.\n\nIronically enough, I first met Post at a meeting of some of the world's largest hog producers. Without any apparent fear or trepidation, he took the stage in front of several hundred hog farmers and meat processors and told them their business was causing undue animal suffering and environmental harm.\n\nNo matter the news on health and environmental outcomes, most people are still going to want to eat a burger.\n\nPost's concerns are widely reflected in popular culture. For example, the 2014 documentary film Cowspiracy argues that meat eating is single greatest environmental threat to the planet. Bill Maher, comedian and host of an HBO talk show bearing his name, wrote, \"If you care about the planet, it's actually better to eat a salad in a Hummer than a cheeseburger in a Prius.\" James McWilliams, in an op-ed in the New York Times, perhaps summed up the prevailing view best when he wrote: \"The industrial production of animal products is nasty business. From mad cow, E. coli and salmonella to soil erosion, manure runoff and pink slime, factory farming is the epitome of a broken food system.\" McWilliams argues that modern livestock agriculture is so damaging that the only moral solution is to give up eating meat entirely.\n\nPost has taken a different tack\u2013one that has sometimes put him at odds with vegetarian advocacy groups. Rather than selling PETA's tax meat tote bags or cajoling and chastising people for eating meat, he recognizes that most people like to eat a good steak. Only about 5% of the U.S. population claims to be vegetarian or vegan, and 84% of the people who are vegetarians and vegans eventually go back to eating meat. It seems that we are biologically wired to want to eat meat. That bite of filet mignon is a protein-packed, nutrient-dense morsel of tasty goodness. Anthropology shows that humans have probably eaten meat since the beginning, and the some biologists believe that meat consumption, and the ability to increase nutrient content through cooking meat, played a role in increasing our brain size, making us into the species we are today.\n\nNo matter the news on health and environmental outcomes, most people are still going to want to eat a burger. So why not try to make sure that the meat we do eat has as little environmental impact as possible?\n\nFrom a small number of donor animals, we can ultimately get our burgers, chops, and chicken tenders without harm to the cows, pigs, or chickens.\n\nPosts's approach yields the bacon and burgers we love without the hog or cow. All animals have stem cells living in their muscles. These cells are capable of regenerating muscle cells for the animal. They're also capable of creating muscle cells outside the animal. The trick is to harvest stem cells from the muscle of a live cow or pig and turn them loose in the right environment in a lab. Stem cells proliferate quickly. A single stem cell can generate a hundred trillion cells of meat. So, from a small number of donor animals (many millions fewer than currently exist to satisfy our appetites), we can ultimately get our burgers, chops, and chicken tenders without harm to the cows, pigs, or chickens. We no longer have to kill the geese to get the golden eggs.\n\nOnce in the lab and given a suitable environment, the stem cells naturally form into muscles. But just because muscle cells have formed, that doesn't mean we have something ready to eat. We all have muscles, but they vary in shape and size. I've got a couple scrawny biceps that pale in comparison to the guns on Arnold Schwarzenegger. How did Schwarzenegger's arms get so big? No doubt genetics played a role, but he's also spent many, many more hours in the gym than me. To build protein and muscle size, exercise is needed. Post and his team attach the muscle cells to each other and to a proverbial petri dish in a way that creates exercise-like tension. The result is muscle fiber (each of which contains around 1.5 million cells). Once these muscle fibers develop, about ten thousand of them are harvested"}

I have spoken with people at all levels of policy-making, and one thing I have come to realize is that when Beijing makes a major policy change, they make it carefully and with great deliberation. And when they arrive at a new consensus, they execute it with remarkable effect on all levels. That is the secret to their thirty-year economic miracle. Now China's top leadership has made such a policy decision. It will transform our world over the next decade.\n\nOn November 29, 2014, a little-noted but highly significant meeting took place in Beijing as Washington was absorbed with its various attempts to cripple and ultimately destabilize Putin's Russia. They held what was termed The Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs. Xi Jinping, Chinese President and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, delivered what was called \"An Important Address\" there.\n\nCareful reading of the official Foreign Ministry statement on the meeting confirms it was indeed \"important.\" The central leadership of China has now made official a strategic global shift in geopolitical priorities in Chinese foreign policy.\n\nNo longer does China regard its relationship with the United Sates or even the EU as of highest priority. Rather they have defined a new grouping of priority countries in their carefully-deliberated geopolitical map. It includes Russia, as well as the entire BRICS rapidly-developing economies; it includes China's Asian neighbors as well as Africa and other developing countries.\n\nTo give a perspective, as recently as 2012 China's foreign ptries in the world, including China); Multilateral Organizations (UN, APEC, ASEAN, IMF, World Bank etc.), and public diplomacy which determines which situations to become engaged in around the world. Clearly China has decided those priorities no longer work to her advantageolicy priorities were described in a general framework: Great Powers (principally the USA, EU, Japan, and Russia); Periphery (all countries bordering China); Developing Countries (all lower income coun.\n\nIn his address to the meeting, President Xi highlighted a sub-category of developing countries: \"Major Developing Powers (kuoda fazhanzhong de guojia). China will \"expand cooperation and closely integrate our country's development\" with the designated Major Developing Powers, Xi declared. According to Chinese intellectuals, these are countries now deemed especially important partners \"to support reform of the international order.\" It includes Russia, Brazil, South Africa, India, Indonesia, and Mexico, that is, China's BRICS partners, as well as Indonesia and Mexico. China has also ceased calling itself a \"developing country,\" indicating the changed self-image.\n\nVice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin indicated one significant aspect of the new policy when at the conference in Beijing he declared that the \"imbalance between Asia's political security and economic development has become an increasingly prominent issue.\" China's proposal to create an Asian \"community of shared destiny\" aims to resolve this imbalance. That implies closer economic and diplomatic ties with South Korea, Japan, India, Indonesia, even Vietnam and the Philippines.\n\nIn other words, although the relationship with the United States will remain highest priority because of America's military and financial power, we can expect an increasingly outspoken China against what it sees as American interference. This was seen clearly in October when the official China Daily wrote an OpEd during Hong Kong's \"Umbrella Revolution\" asking, \"Why does Washington Make Color Revolutions?\" The article named the Vice President of the US Government-financed regime-change NGO, National Endowment for Democracy as involved. Such directness would have been unthinkable just six years ago when Washington tried to embarrass Beijing by stirring up violent protests by the Dalai Lama Movement in Tibet just before the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nChina is openly rejecting the usual Western criticism on human rights and recently declared a freeze in China-UK diplomatic relations following a meeting by the Cameron government with the Dalai Lama and to Norway over its recognition of dissident Liu Xiaobo. Over the past year, step-by-step Beijing has dismissed Washington's criticism of its reclamation of its historical claims in the South China Sea.\n\nBut perhaps most significant, in recent months, China has boldly moved an agenda to build alternative institutions to the US-controlled IMF and World Bank, a potentially devastating blow to US economic power if it succeeds. To counter the US attempt to economically isolate China in Asia through creation of a US Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Beijing has announced its own Chinese vision of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), an \"all inclusive, all-win\" trade deal that really promotes Asia-Pacific cooperation.\n\nElevating Russian Relations\n\nAt present, what clearly emerges is China's decision to make its relation with Putin's Russia central to this new priority strategy. Despite decades of mistrust following the 1960 Sino-Soviet split, the two countries have begun a depth of cooperation unprecedented. The"}

{"id": 1069, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Mindfulness practice of present moment awareness promises many benefits, but has eluded rigorous behavioral measurement. To date, research has relied on self-reported mindfulness or heterogeneous mindfulness trainings to infer skillful mindfulness practice and its effects. In four independent studies with over 400 total participants, we present the first construct validation of a behavioral measure of mindfulness, breath counting. We found it was reliable, correlated with self-reported mindfulness, differentiated long-term meditators from age-matched controls, and was distinct from sustained attention and working memory measures. In addition, we employed breath counting to test the nomological network of mindfulness. As theorized, we found skill in breath counting associated with more meta-awareness, less mind wandering, better mood, and greater non-attachment (i.e., less attentional capture by distractors formerly paired with reward). We also found in a randomized online training study that 4 weeks of breath counting training improved mindfulness and decreased mind wandering relative to working memory training and no training controls. Together, these findings provide the first evidence for breath counting as a behavioral measure of mindfulness.\n\nIntroduction\n\nJames (1890), a founder of American Psychology wrote, \"the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again is the very root of judgment, character, and will. \u2026 An education which should improve this faculty would be the education par excellence.\" In the 1960s and more recently, others have productively followed James's interest in wandering attention \u2013 under the overlapping terms of mind wandering, task-unrelated-thought (TUT), and stimulus-independent thought \u2013 to document that it occurs 30\u201350% of daily life (Klinger and Cox, 1987; Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010), and is associated with cognitive task errors (Antrobus, 1968) and worse mood (Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010; Wilson et al., 2014; but see Franklin et al., 2013).\n\nIn contrast, research on the education of voluntarily bringing back a wandering mind has evoked both promise and controversy. Regarding its promise, the practice of returning attention to the present, which is core to mindfulness, has been associated with reduced pain (Zeidan et al., 2011), improved attention (Brefczynski-Lewis et al., 2007), and enhanced well-being (Brown and Ryan, 2003; Tang et al., 2007) among other benefits (H\u00f6lzel et al., 2011).\n\nNonetheless, mindfulness measurements are controversial. For example, self-report on the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer et al., 2006) cannot distinguish individuals receiving Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction vs. a validated active control intervention (MacCoon et al., 2012) because both interventions increase reported mindfulness equally (MacCoon, personal communication). In addition, mindfulness trainings and monetary incentives equally increase certain cognitive test scores, suggesting that the demand characteristics inherent in mindfulness training studies may result in training studies measuring effects of non-specific factors such as motivation as opposed to, or at least in addition to, mindfulness (Jensen et al., 2012). Therefore, it is unclear the extent to which mindfulness per se is captured by self-report or responsible for improvements following putative mindfulness trainings.\n\nIt is therefore critical for the field to establish a behavioral and thus less biased measure of mindfulness. Unlike questionnaires, which suffer from retrospective distortions and susceptibility to implicit demand characteristics (e.g., pressure on meditators to report being mindful), behavioral measures prevent \"faking good\" as ability must be demonstrated instead of simply averred. A behavioral measure could also avoid the confounding, non-specific training effects introduced in mindfulness training studies and provide a more efficient assessment. However, to our knowledge, no behavioral measure of mindfulness exists for scientific use. To address this gap, we present the first validation of such a measure.\n\nDefining and Operationalizing Mindfulness\n\nWe chose present moment awareness as a definition of mindfulness to operationalize. Grounded in traditional descriptions of mindfulness (Supplementary Material Introduction), it is a commonality in the diversity of modern scientific definitions (e.g., Brown and Ryan, 2003; Bishop et al., 2004; Baer et al., 2006; Schooler et al., 2011) and meditation styles, which variably emphasize non-attachment, non-judgment, or other facets as well.\n\nMindfulness of breathing can be indexed by breath counting, which lends itself to objective behavioral study and draws face validity from its longstanding use in mindfulness practice (recorded c. 430 AD, Buddhaghosa, 2010). Prima facie, accurately counting breaths operationalizes mindfulness because it depends on (1) directly perceiving the experience of breathing in the present and (2) awareness that experience (such as mind wandering) is happening, which enables a return of attention to the breath whenever attention drifts. Therefore, although counting is not necessary for mindfulness, we propose mindfulness contributes to accurate breath counting.\n\nEvaluating the Construct Validity of Breath Count"}

You keep on winding around the back roads of the 65 \u2013 itself a back road as highways go \u2013 searching for a delivery address that may not actually exist. The beat-up truck you're driving is more of an antique than the furniture you're hauling, but you figure it can make it through one last run. Or, well, you figured, but the night's dragging on and this slice of backwoods Kentucky gets stranger by the minute. At this point you can't be sure you're not asleep at the wheel and dreaming the whole thing, but you keep rolling onward anyway, hoping to make sense of the whole mess and get where you're going in one piece.\n\nThat's more or less the gist of Kentucky Route Zero. Except that it's also not, at all. This game defies description, and for your sake, that's kind of a good thing. It's one of those titles that I recommend experiencing cold \u2013 not necessarily because it's full of surprises (although it is), but because you shouldn't let anyone else color your interpretation. If you want my recommendation, I say you should buy and play the game tonight, while it's on sale. There's no better use for that 20 bucks.\n\nI know I've made that recommendation before, but\u2026 look, I know adventure games. I've played through Broken Sword, Myst, Broken Age, The Longest Journey, Bladerunner, Grim Fandango, every Phoenix Wright and Layton game, every game from Telltale, almost every game from Daedalic (begrudgingly), and just about anything I can get running in ScummVM. So it should carry some weight when I tell you that, in my entire life, I have never pointed at and clicked on anything as beautiful, thought-provoking, or profound as Kentucky Route Zero. I really hope that's enough to convince you to stop reading and play it, but if it's not\u2026\n\nThis a game about people, though its definition of the term is fairly broad. You play as Conway, an antique delivery man who needs to navigate a secret highway, the Zero, to find an address that's not on any map. You also play Shannon, a TV repair lady in search of her lost cousin, Weaver. And then there's Erza, a curious young boy whose brother, Julian, is a giant eagle who carries houses. Act three introduces Junebug and Johnny, a pair of mining robots who struck out on the open road to become musicians.\n\nAt any moment, the game can put you in control of any one of these strange souls \u2013 or anyone who happens to be around at the moment \u2013 be it mid-stride or even mid-conversation. In most games, dialogue trees let you choose what you say. Here, you can choose who says it, and how, and even what the topic of conversation is in the first place. In some moments of idle banter, you control both sides simultaneously, dictating the back and the forth.\n\nThe choices you make are even less conventional than the structure of the dialogue. Instead of trying to sort right from wrong, you decide whether a conversation stays focused or gets derailed by reminiscence and philosophical musings. Even when you're asked a question and given three possible answers in traditional adventure game fashion, your options are anything but traditional. Rather than determining what happens next, more often than not you're filling in what's happened before \u2013 the people and experiences that shaped each of your characters. Most games provide fixed context and ask you for a resolution, but here it's the other way around.\n\nIt's easy to liken it to a dream, given the abstract, blocky visuals and the nagging feeling of never being quite sure how you got where you are. The game certainly cultivates a dreamlike atmosphere with its ambient music, a mix of soothing electronic tunes and far-off, tinny country that sounds like it's being played on a car radio in another plane of consciousness. Yet, despite the constant weirdness, the people you meet all feel very grounded and real, concerned with their petty squabbles, their back pain, and their mounting debt. One woman works at an underground office tower with a floor dedicated to bears, but she still thinks about advancing in her career, and where she'll be taking her next vacation.\n\nGetting where you're going is nearly as surreal as talking to the people there. The county is portrayed as a black and white vector map, with Conway's truck represented by a single wheel rolling along its twisting roads. You can click anywhere and Conway will drive there, or you can drag the mouse ahead of the truck to pull it along (the same intuitive control scheme is used to navigate environments). There's always somewhere you have to be, but you're free to roam around. Scattered throughout the county are landmarks \u2013"}

Foxconn is one of the biggest hardware manufacturers in the world, with plans to set up new manufacturing units in India, - and Gou says that it wants to do this as quickly as possible. Gou tells us that Foxconn wants to open 10-12 manufacturing facilities in India by 2020, but this needs a push from the government to go forward.\n\n\"I am ready, ask your government,\" says Gou. \"Which state will make India most friendly for manufacturing - that's where we will start. There will be at least 1 million jobs created by 2020, maybe more, and not just basic jobs but jobs for skilled workers and engineers. We want to set up our plant in rural areas, and transform the area, with jobs and infrastructure.\"\n\nFoxconn already has manufacturing experience in India - it first opened a plant in Chennai a decade ago, but there were \"complications,\" Gou says, adding, \"[it was] not our fault, [but the] political situation.\"\n\nGou feels that the government at the time was not supporting manufacturing enough. This is something that he says has changed by now. \"[Prime Minister Narendra] Modi has pushed for development, I like your Make in India, Skill India,\" says Gou. \"You have software, you have content, you need hardware and now Modi has made it your goal.\"\n\n(Also see: SoftBank, Foxconn, and Bharti Partner on Solar Power Projects in India)\n\n\"Indian local [state] government is also much more friendly now,\" he adds, saying, \"I met with the Chief Ministers of three of your states, AP [Andhra Pradesh], Gujarat, and Maharashtra. [The CMs of] Gujarat and Maharashtra came to China, and saw my facilities, and they're keen that we set up in their states. Ten years ago, government was not friendly.\"\n\nAnother major development, which Gou says helped convince Foxconn to invest in India, is the growing online businesses. \"Your Internet content has grown, and your entrepreneurs, they are very smart people,\" says Gou. \"They have created lots of opportunity, but they need hardware support and we will give it to them.\"\n\nAt this point, Gou wouldn't reveal the names of the companies that Foxconn is working with in India, or even the products it will manufacture here, though he hinted that there would be a preference for local brands.\n\n\"I don't care what brands I make here; you ask about Apple, but we will make the products where it makes sense,\" he says, \"we have to look at lot of different factors before deciding what to make. But we will work with local brands and help them with design, and manufacture components locally, so that Indian brands can also start to export, right now India does not export.\"\n\nBut there are some major bottlenecks that he says need to be solved first, if the Make in India goal is to be achieved.\n\n\"Your infrastructure will be a big limitation. Today I was told it will take 20 minutes to reach you, but it took 1 hour 20 minutes because it rained,\" he points out. \"Power is a problem. If there is a power cut, the entire factory has to stop working. Power, water, skilled workers, all these problems need to be solved.\"\n\n(Also see: Taiwan's Innolux Looks to Invest in India With Foxconn)\n\n\"Even your tax - every state has different tax regulations, so we need to work this out for every place we want to do business,\" he adds. That said, he's not focussing on any one state right now - some believe that PM Modi's home state of Gujarat is a likely candidate for Foxconn's first factory - and a team from the company is in that state right now - but Gou says that there have been no decisions yet.\n\nHowever, Gou also believes that the Indian government doesn't do enough to support local entrepreneurs. He says that while Indian entrepreneurs have been smart and have lots of good ideas, the government can do more to help startups.\n\n\"In China, we have BAT - Baidu, Ali, Tencent. That is like Google, Amazon, Facebook, in China,\" says Gou. \"Why doesn't India have one? You have e-commerce, but you don't have any big cloud company like BAT. And the infrastructure - in China, in two years, we are 98 percent 4G. In India, your 4G is just 1 percent. And your 3G keeps switching to 2G.\"\n\n\"The spectrum is so expensive here, and the ARPUs are so low,\" he adds, \"your companies spend all their money on spectrum when they need money to improve"}

We now need to morph the space again to better suite our needs and the needs of the community\n\nRBM provides local makers, collectors and artists a place to set-up shop and grow their independent businesses\n\nLocal residents and shoppers from surrounding communities enjoy weekend strolls through the market. We now want to offer them more ways to utilize the RBM by building an all-purpose event space that harmonizes with the market element.\n\nInterior view from main entrance (9 Mile and Woodward)\n\nIn a community rife with talent, local musicians serenade weekend shoppers on The RBM's center stage.\n\nSome musicians have requested to shoot music videos and have after-hours concerts at The Rust Belt, but this is not easy with our current set-up & security obstacles.\n\nWe even have a local roaster (HenriettaHaus Coffee Roasters) building a unique brand and loyal customer base each and every weekend.\n\nOur old layout.\n\nOur new layout! The red boxes represents vendor spaces. The new event space will consume 4000sq ft of our 15,000.\n\nWhat's This Thing?\n\nThe Rust Belt Market is a home for working artists. Built on the bones of a failed Old Navy, the Rust Belt gives makers, dreamers, artists and craftsman a beautiful and affordable place to sell their work. This isn't just another mall or flea market though; this is curated \u2013 almost like an art gallery. You'll never see Honey Boo Boo shirts, truck nutz or 90's DVD's being peddled in our space. Creativity is in the air, along with music, the smell of artisan roasted coffee, and the din of thousands of people connecting with the people that make their things. One of the major goals of this expansion project is to lead to the market component being open beyond the current weekend hours.\n\nWhere is it?\n\n'Where is it?' is almost the most important part of the story. The Rust Belt lives at the northwest corner of 9 Mile and Woodward Avenue in the bohemian city of Ferndale, Michigan, one mile north of Detroit. The location is important for our story. What's the story? In 2010, the economy was bad and Michigan's was one of the worst. Chris and Tiffany Best saw the writing on the wall. They had respectable jobs and skills but wanted to invent their own future. How though? Tiffany's own design studio? Boutique with consignment? The 'ah-ha!' moment came at an art fair. What if this could happen every weekend? Tiffany wrote a convincing business plan and on paper it was perfect. Artisans could have their own community in which to do business on a regular basis and they wouldn't have to travel weekend-to-weekend. They could, just maybe, NOT be starving artists. After some quick research, they discovered this model was already working in Brooklyn. They visited the NY spot and nosed their way into speaking with the owners, who said \"We think you have moxie and may be able to pull it off. We'll let you know what to do and what not to do because there's no way in hell we will ever do this in Detroit.\" The rest is history. Mostly. Remember the line mentioned above? \"On paper it was perfect!\"\n\nWhy Do We Need Funding?\n\nNow is when we get to the location being important to the story. In order to have successful artists we need to offer them two things: Lots of foot traffic and low costs. If we're in a hip spot with high foot traffic we've got high rent, if we have high rent we need to figure out a way to keep our costs down. That means finding other ways of bringing home the bacon to keep the doors open. This means using the space we have in ways we haven't. We're an anchor business in Ferndale because of our location, but we haven't been acting like it. Our expensive space at Nine Mile and Woodward isn't open for five days of the week for several reasons. Some vendors make enough during the weekends to sustain a decent living, most don't and keep a part or full time job to make ends meet. Right now foot traffic during the weekdays is not what it is on the weekends because most people work during the day, so any vendor wouldn't make the profit they need to stay open. Also, our current model does create opportunity for small business but it does not support us hiring desperately needed"}
{"id": 1082, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Italian champions in the very prestigious discipline of sacking coaches, Palermo, did it again. Once more, controversial owner of Sicilian team, Maurizio Zamparini, did what everyone was expecting he would \u2013 he sacked Giampiero Gasperini. Except, this time, almost everyone agrees \u2013 it was justified. Palermo was playing badly and more importantly \u2013 they are at the bottom of the table, so the fear of relegation is becoming very real.\n\nGasperini, after replacing Giuseppe Sannino who was Palermo's coach at the start of the season, did what he always does \u2013 shapes his team according to his ideas. He likes playing an attacking 3-4-3 formation, but in Palermo (like in Inter before) it didn't work. Considering players he had in the squad, it's probable that a four man defense would have been much better for Palermo. Fact remains, most of the Palermo players simply didn't play good this season. Defense, consisting most often of Munoz, Garcia and Von Bergen (and even Massimo Donati on few occasions, even though he's a midfielder) didn't really fill their fans with confidence, even though they are decent players. A lot of Palermo's games this season had the same or at least similar, story to it \u2013 Palermo trying to create more, to attack their opponent, but usually they lack ideas on how to score, and usually, they lose.\n\nZamparini decided to appoint Alberto Malesani (ex manager of Verona and Fiorentina among others, but for some, the most notable thing he's done was this press conference when he was coaching Panathinaikos ) in Gasperini's place. His first game was against Pescara at home, and Palermo looked kind of like under Gasperini \u2013 attacking, keeping the ball, creating more than the opponent (admittedly, against Pescara it is not that hard to be a better team) \u2013 or at least trying to, because most of the game Palermo was looking even lethargic, but in the end without many ideas in the final third of the pitch and Palermo got only 1 point from the game.\n\nGasperini wasn't the only one who left Palermo recently \u2013 CEO Pietro Lo Monaco left only a day or two later. The reason was \u2013 he disagreed with Zamparini on the choice of the new coach. Lo Monaco wanted Pasquale Marino (ex Catania, Udinese, Parma, Genoa) and when Zamparini gave the job to Malesani, he resigned. And like almost everyone agrees that sacking Gasparini was a right move, parting ways with Lo Monaco, most Calcio fans would agree, was a mistake. But it wasn't by any means surprising in that Lo Monaco is, like Zamparini, a man with a big ego and it was always strange that he accepted to work for a guy like Zamparini \u2013 and before that, in the summer, for equally controversial Enrico Preziosi, Genoa's owner, and that cooperation lasted even less, he left Genoa about 2 months after he got the job. His ego aside, Pietro Lo Monaco is the guy who knows how to do his job. He is basically the creator of Catania we know today, a team that always has few talented players, and a team that is so well-organized and selected that it will make any coach look good. He is an expert in South American, especially Argentinian football, which is quite obvious if you just look at Catania in the last few years \u2013 there were always at least 7 Argentinians in starting 11 of. This January transfer window suggested that the same could happen in Palermo \u2013 Lo Monaco brought 4 Argentinians, with 5th target Hauche ending in Chievo instead of Palermo. Lo Monaco brought no less than 10 players in January (although he didn't bring Kyle Lafferty despite negotiations according to few Italian papers, which is shame as it would be really fun to see him in Serie A) .\n\nPerhaps the most important signing was Stefano Sorrentino, a 33-year-old goalkeeper who was at Chievo for the last 4 years and before that was in Recreativo, AEK and Torino. Sorrentino is probably one of the most underrated keepers (and players in general) in Serie A, in my opinion there are only 2 or 3 keepers that are better than him (those would be Buffon, obviously, Handanovi\u0107 and Marchetti) and it's a little strange that he stayed in Chievo for so long and didn't go to a bigger club. He already showed that he's a great signing for Palermo in the two games he played for his new club so far and if"}

The concept of bacteriotherapy and use of health-beneficial micro-organisms to heal diseases or support immune function was first introduced in the beginning of the 20th century. Later the concept lead to the development of modem dairy industry and even today most probiotic strains are lactobacilli or bifidobacteria used in milk fermentation. The mechanisms of probiotic action are mainly unknown but the inter-microbial species interactions are supposed to play a key role in this together with their immuno-stimulatory effects. The introduction of probiotic bacteria in the mouth calls for ascertainment of their particular safety. Since acid production from sugar is detrimental to teeth, care must be taken not to select strains with high fermentation capacity. The first randomized controlled trials have nevertheless shown that probiotics may control dental caries in children due to their inhibitory action against cariogenic streptococci. Less evidence exists on their role in periodontal disease or oral yeast infections. Furthermore the best vehicles for oral probiotic applications need to be assessed. So far mainly dairy products have been investigated but other means such as probiotics in chewing gums or lozenges have also been studied. From the clinical practitioner's point of view direct recommendations for the use of probiotics cannot yet be given. However, scientific evidence so far indicates that probiotic therapy may be a reality also in dentistry and oral medicine in the future."}

She answered her phone\u2014she's had an iPhone since she was 11\u2014sounding as if she'd just woken up. We chatted about her favorite songs and TV shows, and I asked her what she likes to do with her friends. \"We go to the mall,\" she said. \"Do your parents drop you off?,\" I asked, recalling my own middle-school days, in the 1980s, when I'd enjoy a few parent-free hours shopping with my friends. \"No\u2014I go with my family,\" she replied. \"We'll go with my mom and brothers and walk a little behind them. I just have to tell my mom where we're going. I have to check in every hour or every 30 minutes.\" Those mall trips are infrequent\u2014about once a month. More often, Athena and her friends spend time together on their phones, unchaperoned. Unlike the teens of my generation, who might have spent an evening tying up the family landline with gossip, they talk on Snapchat, the smartphone app that allows users to send pictures and videos that quickly disappear. They make sure to keep up their Snapstreaks, which show how many days in a row they have Snapchatted with each other. Sometimes they save screenshots of particularly ridiculous pictures of friends. \"It's good blackmail,\" Athena said. (Because she's a minor, I'm not using her real name.) She told me she'd spent most of the summer hanging out alone in her room with her phone. That's just the way her generation is, she said. \"We didn't have a choice to know any life without iPads or iPhones. I think we like our phones more than we like actual people.\" Related Story Your Smartphone Reduces Your Brainpower, Even If It's Just Sitting There I've been researching generational differences for 25 years, starting when I was a 22-year-old doctoral student in psychology. Typically, the characteristics that come to define a generation appear gradually, and along a continuum. Beliefs and behaviors that were already rising simply continue to do so. Millennials, for instance, are a highly individualistic generation, but individualism had been increasing since the Baby Boomers turned on, tuned in, and dropped out. I had grown accustomed to line graphs of trends that looked like modest hills and valleys. Then I began studying Athena's generation. Around 2012, I noticed abrupt shifts in teen behaviors and emotional states. The gentle slopes of the line graphs became steep mountains and sheer cliffs, and many of the distinctive characteristics of the Millennial generation began to disappear. In all my analyses of generational data\u2014some reaching back to the 1930s\u2014I had never seen anything like it. The allure of independence, so powerful to previous generations, holds less sway over today's teens. At first I presumed these might be blips, but the trends persisted, across several years and a series of national surveys. The changes weren't just in degree, but in kind. The biggest difference between the Millennials and their predecessors was in how they viewed the world; teens today differ from the Millennials not just in their views but in how they spend their time. The experiences they have every day are radically different from those of the generation that came of age just a few years before them. What happened in 2012 to cause such dramatic shifts in behavior? It was after the Great Recession, which officially lasted from 2007 to 2009 and had a starker effect on Millennials trying to find a place in a sputtering economy. But it was exactly the moment when the proportion of Americans who owned a smartphone surpassed 50 percent.\n\nThe more I pored over yearly surveys of teen attitudes and behaviors, and the more I talked with young people like Athena, the clearer it became that theirs is a generation shaped by the smartphone and by the concomitant rise of social media. I call them iGen. Born between 1995 and 2012, members of this generation are growing up with smartphones, have an Instagram account before they start high school, and do not remember a time before the internet. The Millennials grew up with the web as well, but it wasn't ever-present in their lives, at hand at all times, day and night. iGen's oldest members were early adolescents when the iPhone was introduced, in 2007, and high-school students when the iPad entered the scene, in 2010. A 2017 survey of more than 5,000 American teens found that three out of four owned an iPhone. The advent of the smartphone and its cousin the tablet was followed quickly by hand-wringing about the deleterious effects of \"screen time.\" But the impact of these devices has not been fully appreciated, and goes far beyond the usual concerns about curtailed attention spans. The arrival of the smartphone has radically changed every aspect of teenagers' lives, from the nature of their social interactions to their mental health.

You are president of Russia, and you go and say stupid things like that?\"\n\nMr Putin's attitude to gay people was \"isolating and prejudiced\" and \"ridiculous\", he added.\n\nSir Elton went on: \"I would like to meet (Mr Putin). It's probably pie in the sky ... He may laugh behind my back when he shuts the door, and call me an absolute idiot, but at least I can think I have the conscience to say I tried.\"\n\nThe star thanked Mr Poroshenko for his \"support\" after meeting with him.\n\nHe said on Instagram: \"After speaking at the YES Ukraine 2015 Conference today in Kiev, I met with Ukraine President Poroshenko about the importance of legislative changes to support LGBT rights.\n\n\"Specifically, I asked him to: 1. Ban discrimination in the workplace based on sexuality and gender identity. 2. Provide criminal penalties for hate crimes.\n\n\"We need Ukrainian businessmen and power brokers to create a more inclusive and tolerant society. We need this everywhere!\"\n\nSir Elton has been outspoken on the issue of gay rights before, most recently when, earlier this year, he temporarily boycotted Dolce and Gabbana after the fashion designers called children conceived by IVF \"synthetic\".\n\nHe has two sons, Zachary, four, and Elijah, two, with husband David Furnish."}
{"id": 1094, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "I do expect some things to still change between the time that this article is posted and the actual fork date. I expect some more companies to back out, Bitso for example realized that there is no community behind 2X and that it's not an \"upgrade\" but rather a split. However, here are some of my \"final thoughts\" about the upcoming Segwit2X.\n\n1) Financial incentives\n\nCore devs own Bitcoin and most are working for free on this great open source project. Which means that their financial incentive is doing what's best for Bitcoin in the long run.\n\nThe CEO's of the NYA companies all pivoted away from Bitcoin. Jihan created and supports BCash, Roger Ver claims that BCash is Bitcoin\u2026 Brian from Coinbase has claimed multiple times that he thinks that Ethereum is superior to Bitcoin. Jeff Garzik launched his own ICO to solve \"developer drama and forks,\" Bitcoin problems that he himself created.\n\nNone of them want to put their money where their mouth is.\n\n2) Slow blocks after HF\n\nSome say that people will abandon Bitcoin if it slows down significantly (until next difficulty adjustment). Never heard of \"Hodlers\"?\n\nTraders have Bitcoin on exchanges, unless they're arbitraging, they don't need to move Bitcoin around. Most hodlers have their coins in cold storage.\n\nEveryone knows what's going to happen. It's silly to think major hodlers will sell their Bitcoin to move over to 2X corporate takeover chain.\n\nObviously it will suck for a while, potentially very slow blocks and obvious spam from 2X'ers. But I personally see Bitcoin as my savings account.\n\nFollowing Gresham's law, for everyday purchases I use my fiat holdings.\n\nI have my cold storage, my trading stash and my \"fun fund\". (\"Fun fund\" is for vacations, new electronic \"toys\" and gifts for my son and wife. Stuff like that. It's linked to a credit card.)\n\nWill it be annoying that I potentially can't transfer Bitcoin for a month or two? Sure. Will that change my mind and capitulate to 2X? Hell no.\n\n3) The chain with the most accumulated difficulty is Bitcoin\n\nThinking as a clueless 2X CEO: \"So all we need to do is have miners mine a few days and everyone will call 2X Bitcoin.\"\n\nThe chain with most accumulated difficulty IS Bitcoin, but only if it falls within the current rules of consensus and 2X breaks consensus.\n\nCore nodes will just reject the invalid blocks that 2X miners generate and ~96 percent of all nodes are Core nodes. The majority of the 2X nodes are run on AWS.\n\n4) This was never about scaling\n\nFirst point: There is no 1MB and 2MB. This is just false information. There is no block size anymore, it's block weight. Anyone calling it 1MB and 2MB is either intentionally trying to spread false information or just totally clueless.\n\nWhile the Segwit2X proposal (Yes, they like to call it a proposal, even though it's an attack) specifically mentions \"Segwit\" and the main argument for pushing the \"proposal\" through was scaling and having less issues with users and customer support, most of the big companies actually haven't implemented Segwit.\n\n5) Slowed down development\n\nEach hard fork puts extra pressure on the development teams/engineers of Bitcoin companies. They have to make sure everything is safe for their company and provide their users with the ability to withdraw coins from the other fork.\n\nBitcoin Core lost time working on really useful (scaling) features because they implemented some features to kick 2X nodes off the network.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is just another attack against Bitcoin, it is a big one this time, but Bitcoin will come out stronger once again if it survives.\n\nWhatever Jeff, Bobby or any others like to tell you: This is not an upgrade, this is an attack.\n\nPrepare for very slow blocks and high fees, whatever that means for you. For me it doesn't really change anything. I have some Bitcoin on exchanges to dump my 2X at a good price without having to wait for splitting tools for Trezor or something. But always keep in mind that keeping coins on exchanges is risky. You need to think about your personal risk/reward.\n\nBTC1 doesn't have any developers, Core's cypherpunks just keep coding on. BTC1 is already a few versions behind and will keep falling further and further behind from a technological (and obviously decentralized) point of view.\n\nHigh fees suck, everyone agrees on that, but always keep in mind that fees are calculated in BTC, not USD. The Bitcoin price went up x10 this last year. The good news is that there's so much cool stuff being developed that will end up lowering the fees"}

That being said, Furiko plays on its simplicity with great success, with the emotions of its characters pulling through in every fleeting scene. The narrative is pushed along with the frame being captured in a swinging pendulum, only stopping when the man pauses to realize the beauty in his life. Like a swinging pendulum, life moves on, and these realizations are far and in between life's tragically brief existence.The music accompanying the man's story is perfect. It's a vague statement, but one that isn't really given out lightly. The lyric-less song begins with four piano chords, which repeat themselves throughout the entirety of the story. With the repetition of these chords matching up with the incessant swinging of the \"pendulum\", violin melodies are added as the story progresses, similar to Pachelbel's Canon in D. Like the story, the melody's buildup has a beginning, a climax, and an end, bringing everything back to the same four chords used at the beginning of the piece. Ashes to ashes, so to speak. It very much reflects the whole aspect of life as a journey, marked at the beginning and end with life and death.I'm not a big fan of the word \"tearjerker\", but in Furiko's case, tearjerker is most definitely an understatement.

We went to bed early last night (in other words, on time) and got up early go get to the Pena Palace and Moorish castle before the crowds. We were so confident in our earliness that we drove to the top of the mountain, and we gambled right because there was lots of parking. The road was really narrow, steep, and winding. I would hate to be a horse in the old times pulling something up those roads.\nFirst we went to the Moorish castle, which I think was originally built in the 1100's. It has been restored a lot since Emily was there. It was interesting because the restoration had a wood theme, kind of like in a sauna. So in some places they restored old ruined buildings in the castle, but instead of using stone for the restored parts, they used beautiful wood. It was tasteful and helped things seem ruined still while giving places to offer services, and that method was a much better option than building new buildings among the old ones, I think. Archeologists had excavated some areas near the castle walls and found foundations of old Moorish homes that the castle walls had been built over. It was crazy thinking these stones were put here by people 1000 years ago. They also restored an old church, which was built at the castle after the castle was conquered from the Moors, or they said it may have been converted from a mosque. The restored church had the same wood thing going on, and it was very beautiful, but very simple. A contrast to most of the churches we've seen so far. We counted stairs going up to the top, and it was 184. On the way down, we took another route and counted 200ish, and then forgot to keep counting. Emily did great for this part.\nNext we went to the Pena Palace, which was built by the queen of Portugal (and her husband, who was a prince-- he would only become a king if the queen died. Weird, huh?). The Pena Palace is a huge castle/palace on top of the hill next to and higher than the hill the Moorish Castle is on. Surrounding the Pena Palace is a huge garden/forest. The palace is full of unique, strange architecture and lots of colors. We didn't plan to go into the palace in order to save money, but combining admission to the castle, gardens, and palace was the same price as just the castle and the gardens, so we got a ticket to go inside. Half of the walk through the palace is outside, winding through arches, along the tops of walls, across terraces and balconies, and the other half is a path through the royal rooms and some galleries of royal collections. It's all very impressive. They were restoring some of the rooms, and it was interesting to watch the workers carefully do the detailed work of restoring old wall tiles. My favorite room was a study where all of the furniture was very finely carved ebony. There was a stand of drawers, two tables and four chairs. Each one must have taken the wood carver a year. The Pena Palace has amazing views of Sintra and the towns beyond to the ocean.\nFinally we walked through the gardens surrounding the palace. At this point we were starting to get very tired. I was carrying Daniel in the baby carrier this whole time except for a bit of him walking at the castle, and Emily was carrying the not-yet-birthed child. Plus a heavy camera and a little backpack with diapers and water. The garden is a huge maze. Every path leads to a little stone house of arches or a pool or a statue. The foliage is huge cedar and oak trees, large boulders, and vines with moss covering everything. We tried to find the hermit's grotto, but got lost on meandering pathways, but instead found the queen's favorite spot to sit. A nice chair had been carved into the rock on the side of a hill, and it had a beautiful view of the Pena Palace and its hill. Our map told us the queen liked to come here and sit. 600 years ago. The more cultivated parts of the garden/estate are full of plants from around the world, planted back when Portugal was a major player in exploring the world. There is a huge fern garden, and it was interesting to see where they all originated.\nWhen Daniel finally woke up and I didn't have to carry him, we got a bit of a second wind. We walked along a series of ponds that feed each other in a row. There were swans in the ponds, and Daniel was very excited about them. Quack quack! Also the fish.\nWhen we made it back to our car, we had been walking for 7 and a half hours. We found a new restaurant based on the woman at the cafe below our apartment's recommendation and ordered bacalhau com natas and roast"}

But because of belt-tightening in Washington and a strengthening economy, it has started shrinking \u2014 and fast.\n\nThe number crunchers at Goldman Sachs have lowered their estimates of the deficit both this year and next, on the back of higher-than-expected revenues and lower-than-projected spending. Analysts started the year projecting that the deficit in the current fiscal year would be about $900 billion. Earlier this year, they lowered the estimate to $850 billion. Now they have lowered it again, to $775 billion, or about 4.8 percent of economic output.\n\n\"Spending in the fiscal year to date is lower than a year ago and the nominal growth rate is lower than it has been in decades,\" the Goldman economists wrote in a note to clients. \"Revenues have also exceeded expectations, with a 12 percent gain fiscal year to date. What is more notable is that the strength in revenues preceded the payroll tax hike at the start of the year, and the spending decline does not seem to reflect sequestration, which has just started to take effect.\" To translate: the deficit could come in even smaller than currently anticipated because of spending cuts and higher tax rates.\n\nOn the face of it, this sounds like something to applaud: The growing economy is bolstering tax revenue and reducing the need for spending on programs like unemployment insurance. Washington has gotten its act together. The budget is finally coming back into balance. Indeed, Goldman now expects the budget deficit to fall to just 2.7 percent of economic output by the 2015 fiscal year. Many economists consider budget deficits that small to be sustainable \u2014 particularly if the federal government is investing in public goods like schools and roads \u2014 with the accrued debt paid off by later years' economic growth.\n\nBut a number of budget experts are booing rather than applauding, including the fiscal hawks at the International Monetary Fund. Last week, the fund nudged down its estimates for United States growth in 2013 and 2014. It said it saw many bright spots in the American economy, including the strength of the private sector, but it criticized Washington for imposing too much austerity, too soon, and thus sapping strength from the recovery and preventing the unemployment rate from coming down faster.\n\n\"The growth figure for the United States for 2013 may not seem very high, and indeed it is insufficient to make a large dent in the still-high unemployment rate,\" the fund said. \"But it will be achieved in the face of a very strong, indeed overly strong, fiscal consolidation of about 1.8 percent of G.D.P. Underlying private demand is actually strong, spurred in part by the anticipation of low policy rates under the Federal Reserve's 'forward guidance' and by pent-up demand for housing and durables.\"\n\nThe fund's economists specifically dinged \"sequestration,\" the $85 billion in mandatory budget cuts that Congress promised to undo, but failed to undo, earlier this year. \"While the sequester has decreased worries about debt sustainability, it is the wrong way to proceed,\" the fund said. \"There should be both less and better fiscal consolidation now and a commitment to more fiscal consolidation in the future.\"\n\nIn its note, Goldman Sachs did specify a few trends that could widen the deficit this year, like a \"negative economic surprise.\" The investment bank did not elaborate much on what that economic surprise could be, but troubles in the emerging economies that are driving global growth, higher gas prices and an intensification of the financial troubles in Europe seem like plausible candidates, as do natural disasters like hurricanes and droughts."}

Both are warning signs with few outward manifestations until a catastrophic event occurs. Treating the symptoms can fend off the resulting malady \u2014 Alzheimer's or a heart attack \u2014 the effects of which may be irreversible and too late to treat.\n\nWe've learned that intervening before the heart attack is a much more powerful approach to treating the problem.

The time to intervene is when the brain is still functioning well \u2014 when people are asymptomatic.\"\n\nAlthough elevated amyloid is associated with subsequent cognitive decline, the study did not prove a causal relationship.\n\nFor years, researchers have acknowledged age is the biggest risk factor when it comes to Alzheimer's. For more than 90 percent of people with Alzheimer's, symptoms do not appear until after age 60, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn 2014, about 46 million adults living in the United States \u2014 15 percent of the population \u2014 were 65 or older. By 2050, that number is expected to expand to 88 million or 22 percent of the population.\n\nThe tipping point\n\nResearchers measured amyloid levels in 445 cognitively normal people in the United States and Canada via cerebrospinal fluid taps or positron emission tomography (PET) scans: 242 had normal amyloid levels and 202 had elevated amyloid levels. Cognitive tests were performed on the participants, who had an average age of 74.\n\nAlthough the observation period lasted 10 years, each participant, on average, was observed for three years.

{"id": 1108, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Introduction\n\nSmall and isolated populations, which are often of conservation concern, are expected to experience some degree of inbreeding given random or non\u2010random mating. Deleterious recessive alleles are consequently more likely to be expressed, causing inbreeding depression in viability and fecundity (Charlesworth & Charlesworth 1999; Charlesworth & Willis 2009). Indeed, inbreeding depression has been observed in numerous wild populations (e.g. Grueber et al. 2010; Agudo et al. 2012; Mattila et al. 2012; Reid et al. 2014), potentially increasing extinction risk and necessitating management intervention (Crnokrak & Roff 1999; Hogg et al. 2006; O'Grady et al. 2006).\n\nInbreeding depression is thought to be primarily caused by the cumulative effects of partially or fully recessive deleterious alleles of small effect expressed across numerous loci (Charlesworth & Charlesworth 1999). However, large\u2010effect deleterious recessive alleles can also contribute to inbreeding depression (Laikre 1999; Remington & O'Malley 2000; Charlesworth & Willis 2009). Small\u2010effect and large\u2010effect alleles can have different implications for the management of inbred wild populations. Inbreeding depression stemming from numerous small\u2010effect alleles may be difficult to alleviate as appropriate management practices such as minimizing breeding between relatives (Hagen et al. 2011) or translocating unrelated individuals into a population (Vil\u00e0 et al. 2003; Hogg et al. 2006) may not be feasible. Conversely, large\u2010effect alleles might potentially be more amenable to management intervention if carriers can be identified and removed from the breeding population (Laikre, Ryman & Thompson 1993; Laikre 1999; Ralls et al. 2000). However, if carriers are numerous or widely distributed within a population then removing them may substantially reduce effective population size (e.g. Ralls et al. 2000; Hammerly, Morrow & Johnson 2013), thereby increasing subsequent inbreeding, genetic drift, demographic stochasticity and extinction risk. Key steps towards informing management strategies for small, wild populations are therefore to identify large\u2010effect alleles contributing to inbreeding depression, and to establish the distribution and identity of carriers.\n\nHowever, direct evidence of phenotypic expression of large\u2010effect deleterious recessive alleles under inbreeding conditions in small, wild populations remains scarce, meaning that the possible impacts of such alleles are rarely incorporated into management strategies. Experimental breeding of wild\u2010sampled individuals has shown that lethal recessive alleles do exist in wild populations (e.g. in monkey\u2010flower, Mimulus guttatus, Willis 1992; fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, Kusakabe et al. 2000; bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei and zebrafish, Danio rerio, McCune et al. 2002). Lethal recessive haplotypes, comprising major genomic inversions and multiple genes inherited as a single unit, are also known to exist in wild populations of house mice (Mus domesticus, t haplotype, Manser et al. 2011) and ruff (Philomachus pugnax, K\u00fcpper et al. 2016). Additionally, in pedigreed captive populations of threatened species, large\u2010effect recessive alleles that would likely be lethal if expressed in the wild have been inferred (Laikre 1999). Examples include chondrodystrophy (dwarfism) in California condor (Gymnogyps californianus, Ralls et al. 2000), diaphragmatic hernias in golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia, Bush et al. 1980) and blindness in grey wolves (Canis lupus, Laikre, Ryman & Thompson 1993). In contrast, the few documented examples of potential large\u2010effect recessive alleles expressed in small, wild populations have severe but non\u2010lethal effects. Examples include testicular abnormalities in Florida panthers (Felis concolor coryi, Roelke, Martenson & O'Brien 1993) and South Australian island populations of koala (Phascolarctos cinereus, Seymour et al. 2001; Cristescu et al. 2009), which can effect fertility (Mahmud et al. 2015), and vertebral abnormalities in the Scandinavian wolf (Canis lupus) population (R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen et al. 2006). Furthermore, the evidence that these conditions are genetic is indirect; testicular and vertebral abnormalities are heritable in various domesticated mammals (Kramer et al. 1982; Mahmud et al. 2015), affected panthers were associated with inbred matings (Roelke, Martenson & O'Brien 1993), and testicular abnormalities in koalas are associated with high effective inbreeding coefficients in sequentially founded populations (Seymour et al. 2001).\n\nOne reason why impacts"}

Beginning in 1916, just before the Red Scare, and closing in 1972, just as our present movement was taking shape, the book serves as \"a prehistory of contemporary anarchism.\" Giving particular attention to the middle decades when anarchism seemed to disappear, Cornell uncovers a missing history and finds \"a clear line of continuity rather than a defined break.\" The line he traces is continuous, but it is not straight. There may not be a gap, but there was most certainly a turn.\n\nIn the early part of the century, from 1905 to 1917, American anarchism was predominantly, but by no means exclusively, syndicalist. The IWW was of singular import. The Red Scare of 1917\u00ad\u20131920 all but destroyed the organization, and the movement. What remained of syndicalism was occupied primarily with legal defense, and other anarchists came to a focus more on education and creating counterinstitutions, rather than mass organizing or immediate insurrection. Hence, anarchists were on the sidelines during the upheavals of the thirties. Then, during the Second World War, the remaining movement split over the question of militarism, with pacifists coming to the fore. At the same time, increasingly much of anarchist activity was in the cultural sphere, and the movement became wedded to the emerging counterculture. \"[R]eadings, performances, and exclusive parties moved to the center of anarchist praxis,\" Cornell writes. \"In the 1940s Bay Area scene, participating in such revelatory events became the primary activity expected of an anarchist. Indeed, we might interpret this as the time and place where an anarchist 'scene' emerged \u2014 exciting and socially rewarding to participants, but easily perceived as insular and exclusionary to those less connected.\"\n\nAnarchism came to comprise a set of cultural practices rather than a coherent movement or body of thought. Thus anarchist ideas, but not organizations, were ubiquitous in their influence on the movement of the sixties. By the end of the decade, as Cornell observes, \"anarchism had never meant more things to more people. What emerged in the early 1970s was not a unified anarchist movement as such but an array of small groups excited by communism, syndicalism, situationism, libertarian socialism, ultraleftism, revolutionary nonviolence, anarcha-feminism, and social ecology.\"\n\nOn the positive side, the move toward pacifist and countercultural politics is what kept anarchism alive after it was decimated by the Red Scare. Moreover, Unruly Equality provides important and inspiring detail of the seldom-heard story of anarchist involvement in the Civil Rights movement \u2014 including, interestingly, support for Robert Williams and his campaign of armed self-defense. For example, Dave Dellinger, a life-long pacifist, argued that until the advocates of nonviolence could demonstrate the success of their approach, they had no right to judge Blacks for using violence to defend themselves. (It is humbling, looking back at the debates of the time, to realize how much better they were \u2014 stronger in argument, more honest in intent \u2014 than those controversies that plague the left today.) And finally, whatever else one might think of the emerging counterculture, it did produce some lasting institutions, including KPFA-Pacifica Radio and City Lights Books.\n\n\nHowever, class struggle largely disappeared from the agenda and the movement became increasingly remote from its traditional base, producing a series of missed opportunities. Anarchists deserted the class war at precisely the moment that the largest number of workers were clamoring to enlist in it, leaving it to the CIO and the Communist Party to benefit from the possibilities opened by the National Labor Relations Act. Nor did anarchists agitate for greater gains under the New Deal, or actively oppose discrimination in the federal relief programs' design and implementation. Of course, given their theories and commitments, it's not clear that anarcho-syndicalists could have done any better. In the midst of the massive changes brought on by the Great Depression, anarchists failed to take account of the ways Keynesianism was reconstituting both capitalism and the state. Their doctrine thus became antiquated, their analysis atrophied, and they failed to adapt themselves to the opportunities and challenges of the new situation.\n\nThe Prefigurative Fallacy\n\nThe turn to pacifism also locked the anarchist movement in a particular \"prefigurative\" orientation."}

It's time to keep pushing forward.\"\n\nThe president told supporters to take their friends and neighbors to vote in three days. \"Make sure they vote for me before you drag them to the polls,\" he said.\n\nSome critics are accusing Mr. Obama and other government officials of praising storm relief efforts too soon.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, on Saturday urged the White House and state leaders in the Northeast dealing with the recovery to \"stop declaring victory, stop giving speeches\" and focus on helping victims of the storm.\n\nObama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki, defending the president's full campaign schedule amid the post-storm suffering on the East Coast, told reporters that Mr. Obama is \"losing his voice a little bit out on the campaign trail\" because he is talking on the phone constantly with state and local officials between rallies where he stumps for votes.\n\n\"In between every single event, he basically walks off the stage, gets on a phone call with governors, mayors and first-responders,\" Ms. Psaki said. \"Just from being backstage, that's what he's doing every single moment. He's focused on it every minute he's not on the stage.\"\n\nThe president also was losing his voice from round-the-clock campaigning in the days before the storm hit the United States. Mr. Romney also has been campaigning full-time since taking a day off to support relief efforts on Tuesday.\n\nBefore leaving Washington Saturday morning for a full day of campaigning, Mr. Obama received a briefing at FEMA headquarters on the recovery efforts from the massive storm and said the hardest-hit states \"still have a long way to go.\"\n\nFEMA administrator W. Craig Fugate and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told Mr. Obama about efforts in New York, New Jersey and elsewhere to restore power, pump water out of flooded homes and businesses, care for people who lost their homes, remove debris and get National Guard in place. The president said relief workers are putting in \"120 percent\" effort.\n\n\"We don't have patience for bureaucracy,\" Mr. Obama told reporters. \"We don't have patience for red tape. It is a painstaking process, but we are making progress.\"\n\nSince the storm struck last weekend, millions of residents have gone without electricity, gasoline shortages have hit the metropolitan New York City region, and complaints have risen about the slow pace of aid reaching areas such as Staten Island, N.Y., and the New Jersey coast. The clamor for help has increased, after state officials such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie initially praised the president's quick response to oversee recovery efforts.\n\n\"Obviously we have now seen that after the initial search and rescue that the recovery process is difficult, it's painful,\" Mr. Obama said. \"But I'm confident that we will continue to make progress as long as state and local and federal officials stay focused. There is nothing more important than us getting this right.\"\n\nMr. Obama spent a little more than an hour Saturday morning in the briefing, which included video conferences with the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and several mayors. He said \"we're starting to shift\" people from shelters in the affected areas to temporary housing.\n\nThe president said helping people recover from the storm is his \"number one priority.\" Reporters asked about the frustration of residents in places such as Staten Island, but Mr. Obama did not respond to their questions.\n\nThe president also campaigned Saturday in Milwaukee, Wis., Dubuque, Iowa, and finally at a late-night rally in Bristow, Va., with former President Bill Clinton and musician Dave Matthews.\n\nMr. Clinton, speaking to the crowd of about 24,000 at the Jiffy Lube Live amphitheater, poked fun at Mr. Romney for avoiding taking stands on various issues.\n\nHe said Mr. Romney \"has tied himself in so many knots \u2026 he could be hired as the chief contortionist for Cirque de Soleil.\"\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 The"}

This danger, however, has not limited the spread of life on Earth to temperate regions. Organisms of all types--plants, animals, fungi and bacteria--have developed ways to combat the deadly growth of ice crystals. In some cases, they pack their cells with small antifreeze compounds like sugars or glycerol. But in cases where extra help is needed, cells make specialized antifreeze proteins to protect themselves as the temperature drops.\n\nNice Ice\n\nAntifreeze proteins don't stop the growth of ice crystals, but they limit the growth to manageable sizes. For this reason, they are also known as ice-restructuring proteins. This is necessary because of an unusual property of ice called recrystallization. When water begins to freeze, many small crystals form, but then a few small crystals dominate and grow larger and larger, stealing water molecules from the surrounding small crystals. Antifreeze proteins counteract this recrystallization effect. They bind to the surface of the small ice crystals and slow or prevent the growth into larger dangerous crystals.\n\nSupercooling\n\nAntifreeze proteins lower the freezing point of water by a few degrees, but surprisingly, they don't change the melting point. This process of depressing the freezing point while not effecting the melting point is termed thermal hysteresis. The most effective antifreeze proteins are made by insects, which lower the freezing point by about 6 degrees. However, antifreeze proteins, even the ones from plants and bacteria that have smaller effects on freezing point, are useful in another way. They are placed outside cells where they control the size of ice crystals and prevent catastrophic ice crystal formation when the temperature drops below the (lowered) freezing point.\n\nIcy Ice Cream"}

They're leading the league in home runs (15) and hitting seems to be contagious to them. Tuesday against the Phillies they hit 7 homers. 5 of those coming from Cespedes (3) and Duda (2). While they can't all keep up that pace all year, right now my suggestion would be pitch around them.\n\n3) Cincinnati Reds (6-2)\n\nWatch out for the big red machine. They're among the league leaders in every major category. They are top three in slugging percentage, stolen bases, and home runs. And they're no slouch on the other side of the ball either posting a 2.57 team ERA and .190 opponent batting average. This year they're poised for success, and they're doing it as a team which is a scary thought.\n\n4) Los Angeles Angels (6-2)\n\nWhile all their stats are among the top in the AL, what the scariest part about them is (other than the obvious Mike Trout) their tenacity. They don't look like the Angels of old at the moment. They already have two come from behind wins, one of those being a six run deficit in the 9th inning, and have played it close all year. Their biggest loss came to the A's when they put up a four run 3rd. They can't sustain this success if they're going to bring every game down to the 9th, but until THEY realize that, they're a threat.\n\nNOT\n\n1) Seattle Mariners (2-7)\n\nWhat can you say about them but yikes. A lineup that includes Kyle Seager, Nelson Cruz, and Robinson Cano you would expect to do a little better. They're batting an abysmal .205 with some of the lowest home run totals in all of baseball. They can't close out games, plain and simple. Remember those Angels we just talked about, well they made the Mariners look like chumps, twice. They have one save in five opportunities and until they can figure out what is happening at the back end of their bullpen, it will continue to be a train wreck.\n\n2) St. Louis Cardinals (2-6)\n\nI don't know where to start. They are a team that has a lot of budding talent that, at the moment, isn't budding. Their ace Carlos Martinez has turned in two quality outings, but can't get a win. They've given up 47 runs through eight games\u2026.that's almost six runs a game for those of you who don't want to do the math. They have the worst team ERA in baseball (5.4) , along with one of the lowest team batting averages in the NL (.218). With the exception of Yadi and Diaz, the whole team has been pretty lack luster. Unless they do something to turn that around they're going to be lucky to be gunning for a wildcard spot come October.\n\n3) San Francisco Giants (3-6):\n\nIt's not an even year, so I guess this is to be expected. The odd part about this is that they're not playing poorly, they just aren't winning. They're top 3 in NL as far as team batting average (.249), they're putting up a decent amount of runs, their pitching isn't terrible (4.8 ERA). They're just losing close games. With the exception of the 3-9 loss to the D-backs on April 6th, all their losses have been within 3 runs. They're just not able to put up runs when it matters. Hopefully it will come around for them, but their luck just"}

{"id": 1125, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "With one exception, Intel's press conference at CES was depressing and a lawyer's signature short of outright lying. It was not just the usual content free and painfully dull hour long slog, they went as far as possible to deceive the press, and it worked.\n\nMother always said, if you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all. We have long ignored that advice, but we will start out with the one good thing that Intel announced at CES, the phones. If it weren't for those, and we actually heeded the advice our mother never actually told us, this would be a pretty short story. Luckily for us, Intel showed off Lexington.\n\nLexington is not just the town over from where mother never gave us the aforementioned advice, but also the new low cost Intel phone platform. If you recall CES 2012, Intel introduced their first real phone platform based around the Penwell SoC. The SoC in this platform is just the same thing with more features fused off and more clocks reduced to get to a 'value' product, but the silicon is unchanged. This 'new' CPU is called the Z2420, and it is the heart of Lexington.\n\nThe platform has a 3.5\u2033 touch screen, 7 shot burst mode pictures, and just about everything you would expect from a modern phone platform. Since it is a down-costed model aimed at the third world and emerging markets, it also has a bunch of features added in that we don't get. FM radio and dual SIMs with dual standby are at the top of the list, followed closely by a MicroSD slot. [Editor wonders why we don't get FM radio on our phones here in the US, starts to feel like a 3rd world country here.] Last but not least, it has mandatory wireless display functionality because most villagers in rural Africa can't afford a full cost phone, Intel seems to think they still have a burning desire to display their cheap phone on a large flat panel TV. Ummm\u2026 nope, no good explanation for that one.\n\nThat said, Intel seems to be doing the right thing here. A low cost phone aimed at the biggest untapped market for smartphones is a good idea, and although they were a bit coy on the cost, no carrier would pick it up unless they were in the right ballpark. Chats with Intel's Mike Bell convinced SemiAccurate that they do get the market they are jumping in to, and understand it's unique needs fairly well. Software and use cases are very different in these markets, and those needs are being addressed well, wireless display aside.\n\nOne other thing that most people don't quite understand is that Intel gives carriers a turnkey platform that they can customize at their whim, or not. The not is the important part, Intel gives OEMs a carrier certified device that is plug and play if they don't want to mess around with it. Load up the logos and splash screens and off you go. In the US and Europe this isn't a big deal. In a brutally cost conscious market it can save the OEMs a lot of money, and that is what this market is all about. Intel is doing right with this phone platform.\n\nFrom there, they announced the Clovertrail Plus SoC for tablets, and knighted it the Z2580. The specs would probably underwhelm, but luckily they were not provided. And when Intel moved on to the upcoming Bay Trail 22nm Atom announcement, it was promised as a quad core coming late in 2013 that would have \">2x performance over current generation\". That is not exactly a high bar for Intel to reach for, and rest assured the drivers will still be abjectly broken so software will run badly, faster. Don't wait in line for this one.\n\nFrom there the topic shifted to a much sadder area, desktop and mobile. Intel was keen to show off \"innovation\", but they utterly failed to do so. In fact, their offerings were so bad that they had to distract and go within a hair of outright lying about their products. Luckily they did so to a room of tame press, and only one lightly called them on it. Money talks and BS gets reprinted as headlines. The truth dies alone in the cold.\n\nWhat is the problem? Intel talked all about Ivy Bridge chips at 7W, and how it was a pull in of a product. It isn't. Nor is it a real product, just a binning and castrating of the existing 17W parts to reach a lower wattage. The unfortunate part is that Intel had to actively deceive a room full of press and analysts to get the headlines they wanted, and get them they did.\n\nYou know Intel is up to something sleazy when they don't pre-brief anyone, don't give out specs, and don't answer questions. It is a sure sign that the products both suck and don't live up to the meager promises they are making. The"}

Overall, this paper describes open-source optics development, system requirements, features, advantages, and known limitations; and discuss future directions for this method of scientific hardware development to radically reduce the cost of research and science education.\n\nAs much of the Internet now relies on free and open-source software (FOSS), open source is becoming a standard method of software development [1] , [2] . Open source developmental methods are a fundamentally new, decentralized, participatory and transparent system to create software in contrast to the closed box, top-down, and secretive standard commercial approach [3] . FOSS provides an alternative to expensive and proprietary systems, reduces research and development costs, and also showcases alternatives to the linear hierarchical structure used to design technology and products. Furthermore, FOSS has demonstrated the efficiency of collaboration, demand-driven innovation and the power of the Internet to provide for a global collective good. The use of FOSS software has assisted a number of engineering fields to do tasks such as CAD, EDA, CFD, FEA, computer vision and even project management. In the sciences FOSS has driven down the costs of numerical simulation in a number of fields ranging from psychotherapy [4] , neural circuit reconstruction [5] , and genomic sequences annotation [6] . Due to this tremendous success of FOSS development, the concept has spread outside of software to areas such as education [7] , [8] , appropriate technology for sustainable development [9] , [10] , science [11] , nanotechnology [12] , [13] and medicine [14] , [15] . Both academic and non-academic scientists are accustomed to this line of thinking as both historical knowledge sharing and the Internet enabled new era of networked science have demonstrated the power of working together [16] , [17] . Today, the rise of open-source hardware is poised to drive down the cost of doing experimental science and put state-of-the-art scientific tools in the hands of everyone [18] .\n\nRecently, the development of open-source 3-D printers like the RepRap [23] , which cost less than $1000 [24] , have made the cost of rapid prototyping accessible to most university laboratories [18] . RepRap's open-source and self-replicating nature (approximately 50% of its own parts can be self-printed) makes it an extremely useful platform for open-source fabrication. The printing process for the additive layer manufacture of optical experimental components is a sequential layer deposition. The RepRap extruder intakes a filament of the working material (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene [ABS] and Polylactic acid [ PLA] polymers), heats it, and extrudes it through a nozzle where deposits a 2-D layer of the working material, then the Z (vertical) axis will raise,"}
{"id": 1128, "ended": true, "length": 840, "text": "The Snap team is happy to announce the release of version 0.14 of Heist.\n\nMajor Changes\n\nNamespace Support\n\nHeist now has support for namespaces. This allows you to configure Heist so that all of your splices require a namespace. Requiring a namespace allows Heist to be more aggressive with errors for unbound splices. For instance, imagine you set the hcNamespace field in your HeistConfig to \"h\", and you bind two splices.\n\nmySplices = do \"foo\" #! fooSplice \"bar\" #! barSplice\n\nWith this setup, you would put the \"h\" namespace on all of the splice tags in your templates. Instead of calling those splices with \"<foo>\" and \"<bar>\", you would use \"<h:foo>\" and \"<h:bar>\". So why go to all this trouble so you have to type more? Because it allows Heist to do more error checking. Without namespaces there is no way for Heist to know whether a tag is supposed to be a splice or not. We could use the list of valid HTML tags to infer it, but that significantly constrains the scope of what we intended for Heist. This approach allows the user to be explicit about which tags should be splices. If you do not want to use namespaces, set the namespace to the empty string.\n\nAlong with the namespace field, we introduced the hcErrorNotBound for controlling the error checking. When hcErrorNotBound is True , Heist will generate an error message if it encounters any namespaced tags that do not have splices bound for them. This eliminates a large class of bugs where users were using a splice in their templates, but forgot to bind it in their code. The intent is that users will usually want to have this error checking turned on. But we felt it was also important to be able to use namespacing without the strict enforcement, so we included this flag to give users full control.\n\nGeneralized Error Reporting\n\nSince this release is doing more error checking, we decided to expose error facilities to the user. This release exposes a new function tellSpliceError that you can use when error conditions are detected in your splices. If you are using compiled Heist, then all your templates will be processed up front at load time. If any of your load time or compiled splices detect an error condition that the user needs to fix, you can call tellSpliceError with an error message. If there are any errors, Heist initialization will fail and all the errors will be returned.\n\nRestructured HeistConfig\n\nThe addition of hcNamespace and hcErrorNotBound to HeistConfig required some restructuring. Previously HeistConfig had a Monoid instance, but we removed that since the new fields make it unclear which instance should be used. But we also did not want to completely get rid of the monoid functionality either. So in order to get the best of both worlds, we refactored all of HeistConfig's previous fields into another data structure called SpliceConfig. This way we can keep the Monoid instance for SpliceConfig and still avoid imposing a weird set of semantics on the user.\n\nUnfortunately, given the use of field accessors it was impossible to make this change without breaking backwards compatibility. What seems like it should have been a simple addition of a couple parameters ended up being a more significant refactoring. To make these kinds of changes easier in the future Heist now exports lenses to all of the HeistConfig fields as well as an emptyHeistConfig value to use as a starting point. These lenses work with both the lens and lens-family-core packages and we export them without incurring a dependency on either lens package.\n\nThe HeistConfig constructor and field accessors have been moved to the Heist.Internal.Types module, so if you really need them, they are still available. However, be aware that Internal modules are subject to change without the deprecation cycle that we use for other modules.\n\nMinor improvements"}

And as president-elect I've heard him repeat it several times, privately if not publicly,\" Ms. Conway said in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. \"It's something that our friend in Israel, a great friend in the Middle East, Israel, would appreciate and something that a lot of Jewish Americans also have expressed their preference for.\"\n\nMaen Rashid Areikat, the chief representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the U.S., said the Palestinians hope Mr. Trump's administration will adhere to the longstanding U.S. position of keeping the embassy in Tel Aviv. He said moving the embassy would make it more difficult to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian issue.\n\n\"We expect the incoming administration and the President-elect to understand the sensitivity of the issue of Jerusalem and to understand that Jerusalem hasn't been recognized by any administration, Republican or Democrat, as the capital,\" he said in an interview.\n\nMr. Areikat declined to detail any contacts between the PLO and the Trump transition team.\n\n\"We are open to a good working relationship with the incoming administration,\" he said. \"We will be seeking communication.\"\n\nCongress has bristled at the executive branch's refusal to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and in 1995 passed legislation requiring that the U.S. embassy be relocated there.\n\nBut the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy act allows the president to waive that order for six month periods for national security reasons, which presidents from both parties have consistently done since the law took effect.\n\n\"It's a great move, it's an easy thing for him to do based on how much he talked about that I think, in the debates, on the stump why it's important to do,\" Ms. Conway said, adding that such a move was also important to Evangelical Christians.\n\n\"Evangelical Christians always have Israel on the top of their list,\" she said.\n\nMr. Trump pledged repeatedly on the campaign trail to move the embassy. However, former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush made similar comments as candidates that went unfulfilled.\n\n\"Every other candidate made the promise but did not act on it because of being told it would inflame opinion throughout the Arab world and potentially trigger violent demonstrations against our embassies,\" said Dennis Ross, who advised multiple presidents on the Middle East, including President Barack Obama.\n\nIt's unclear exactly where Mr. Trump would move the U.S. embassy, but its location could make a difference. Mr. Ross, now at the Washington Institute, said that practically speaking, moving the embassy to West Jerusalem shouldn't affect the eventual \"final status\" of the city because few question whether that area of the city would be part of Israel in any final settlement of the decades-old conflict.\n\n\"But Jerusalem for both Israelis and Palestinians (and Arabs) is an emotional issue and it is easy to ratchet up those emotions when it appears the future of the city is being affected. Rational arguments don't tend to be heard,\" he said.\n\nJerusalem has long been a particularly difficult part of the long-running conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians. Israel captured the western part of the city in 1948 after the country declared statehood. Later, it annexed East Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War. Most countries, including the U.S., refused then to accept Israel's annexation of the eastern part of the city and no country maintains an embassy in Jerusalem though many, including the U.S., have consulates there.\n\nIsrael considers Jerusalem to be its undivided capital.\n\nThe last round of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014 and today, the two sides remain at odds over the construction of Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, the release of Palestinians held in Israeli jails and the schism between Fatah and Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip.\n\nWrite to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com"}

You'll know these brownies are almost done baking when you start to notice a heavenly smell coming from your kitchen. Ingredients \u00bd cup butter \u00be cup cocoa powder 1 cup sugar \u00bd teaspoon vanilla 2 eggs \u00bd cup flour Salt \u00bd to 1 cup chopped walnuts Instructions Adjust oven rack to the middle position. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Grease an 8-inch square baking pan, or line it with aluminum foil and grease the foil. Set aside. Melt butter in a medium pot over low heat. Remove from heat, whisk in cocoa powder, sugar, and vanilla. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated. Transfer mixture to a bowl and gently stir in flour, walnuts, and a pinch of salt. Transfer mixture to greased baking pan and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the middle is just barely set.

If you use spray, do it over the sink (or open dishwasher) so you don't make a mess.\n\nTry lining your baking pan with aluminum foil. Cut a size longer than your baking pan, the over-hang can be used as handles to lift the cooked brownie for cutting.\n\nWhen you mix melted butter, cocoa powder, and sugar together, it will seem sandy. However, once both eggs are added, the sugar will dissolve and give the batter a smooth, glossy texture.\n\nStir in flour, gently, with a wooden spoon (don't use a hand mixer). Gently hand-stirring the mixture will keep the brownies dense rather than cakey.\n\nIncrease the salt from a pinch to \u00bc teaspoon if you're using unsalted butter.\n\nThe cocoa powder makes these brownies rich and chocolatey.

Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nBy now, images of the glorious solar eclipse that graced the shores of America have blasted their way across your news feeds. A few of you may have been lucky enough to witness the once-in-a-lifetime celestial dance in person, whether you were in Oregon or Tennessee, or anywhere in-between.\n\nEven President Trump got in on the Sun-blocking action \u2013 but, being Donald J. Trump, he inevitably took in the majestic sights in precisely the wrong way.\n\nIt's well documented that if you look at the eclipse with the naked eye, it does some serious damage to your retinas. Specifically, it burns them, which as you can imagine has some terrifically awful consequences for your vision.\n\nThat's why that, all over social media, scientists and journalists were essentially screaming at people \u2013 sometimes in all caps \u2013 to make sure that everyone had their protective glasses on, so they could watch the eclipse without going blind. Now, ladies and gentlemen, you'll never guess who ignored this advice.\n\nStanding on a balcony in front of the press, the President of the United States, wearing no such ocular protection at all, stared up at the blazing Sun as the Moon gracefully shifted in front of it. According to reports, one aide shouted up at him: \"Don't look!\"\n\n-\n\nHe was originally shown wearing the protective glasses, but \u2013 shortly after flashing a thumbs up to the gather journalists \u2013 he decided to look up at the eclipse without wearing them. As ever, Trump simply couldn't help himself.\n\nJudging by the footage, it doesn't look like he stared down the full might of our local star for too long, so it's unlikely his retinas got too singed. Still, we're not sure how he's going to make America great again if he can't actually see.\n\nIncidentally, a press release sent out to journalists shortly before the eclipse took place explained that the Commander-in-Chief would be \"watching the total eclipse from the Truman Balcony [of the White House] with the First Lady.\" BuzzFeed's Zahra Hirji noted that from Washington DC, only a partial eclipse would be seen \u2013 and shortly afterward, the White House press statement was updated.\n\n-\n\nThe Trump administration and its figurehead already have the ignominious reputation of being the most anti-scientific federal government in living memory, but this may be a new record. Honestly: how can anyone get a solar eclipse wrong \u2013 on multiple occasions?\n\nWell, there's a first time for everything, we suppose."}

Free from central banks, its value wasn't tied to government policies or geopolitical factors.\n\nBut now it seems the very regulation its creator or creators (since we don't actually know who first minted Bitcoin) guarded against is what's now buoying the cryptocurrency's price.\n\nThe arrival of regulated US Bitcoin exchanges, as well as impending plans to create a BitLicense in New York, have sent the price of Bitcoin up 30% in the past two weeks. Even the Federal Reserve alluded to Bitcoin in its report on the payment industry's future, pledging to keep an eye on virtual currencies. It's been a nice respite for Bitcoin believers after the virtual currency was called the worst investment of 2014, following a nasty tumble from the $1,000-plus highs reached at the end of 2013 to January lows of less than $200.\n\nBut regulation comes neither quickly nor easily, particularly in the US. The Winklevoss twins, Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss (of Facebook fame), recently said they are awaiting approval from New York's top financial regulator for a license to operate a new exchange. The entrepreneurial twins are also still in a regulatory holding pattern over a separate Bitcoin ETF they have been working on for at least two years.\n\nBitcoin platform Coinbase recently touted the launch of what it called the \"first regulated Bitcoin exchange in the US,\" following multi-million-dollar investments from big financial firms such as the New York Stock Exchange and BBVA. But very soon after, officials from California and New York warned consumers the exchange was actually not regulated by their state laws.\n\nCoinbase cites so-called money transmitter licenses in states including Alabama and Arkansas\u2014which were created decades ago to allow companies like Western Union to send and receive money\u2014as part of the reason it considers itself regulated. But it's still working to get licenses in large states such as New York, where it says it falls into \"a regulatory gray area.\"\n\n\"We are working with several companies, including Coinbase, on licensing and will continue to move forward expeditiously,\" Matt Anderson, a spokesman for New York's Department of Financial Services, tells Quartz. \"That said, we have not yet issued any licenses to virtual currency firms.\"\n\nWhile the details remain in flux, Coinbase's strategy to seek regulation seems necessary. If Bitcoin becomes standardized and regulated, it could potentially become as ubiquitous as the credit card. That means big payoffs for Bitcoin-related companies\u2014and for the VC funders behind them.\n\nRegulation will help bring Bitcoin into the mainstream so it's \"easy and accessible for the average person,\" Coinbase's head of government affairs John Collins tells Quartz.\n\nThat's a far cry from the language that once excited people about Bitcoin's potential as a truly independent currency. But when it comes to creating a brand new currency, sometimes it pays to play by the rules."}

The objective of this study was to determine how women with either a low or a high tendency to overeat (TFEQ-disinhibition) and with either a low or a high tendency to restrict intake (TFEQ-restraint) respond to fat and carbohydrate consumed at breakfast. Sixty-four healthy-weight women preselected for high and low TFEQ scores of restraint and disinhibition were enrolled for the study. They came to the laboratory on two separate days to consume breakfast; on one day the principle energy source was fat and on the other day carbohydrate. Satiety responses were determined by ratings of hunger and fullness for 2 h after breakfast, and intake at a mid-morning snack test. Those scoring high on the TFEQ-disinhibition scale consumed more energy at the snack test than those with low TFEQ-disinhibition, but this was only following the high carbohydrate breakfast. The TFEQ-restraint scale did not independently predict food intake or interact with the TFEQ-disinhibition related overeating. In normal-weight females the tendency to overeat may be related to insensitivity to the satiating effects of carbohydrate."}

The bottom line is that we are basically skipping a whole glacial cycle, which is unprecedented. It is mind-boggling that humankind is able to interfere with a mechanism that shaped the world as we know it.\"\n\nFor the first time, research can explain the onset of the past eight ice ages by quantifying several key factors that preceded the formation of each glacial cycle. \"Our results indicate a unique functional relationship between summer insolation and atmospheric CO 2 for the beginning of a large-scale ice-sheet growth which does not only explain the past, but also enables us to anticipate future periods when glacial inception might occur again,\" Ganopolski says.\n\nHumanity as a geological force\n\nUsing an elaborate Earth system model simulating atmosphere, ocean, ice sheets and global carbon cycle at the same time, the scientists analyzed the effects of further human-made CO 2 -emissions on the ice volume on the Northern Hemisphere. \"Due to the extremely long life-time of anthropogenic CO 2 in the atmosphere, past and future emissions have a significant impact on the timing of the next glacial inception,\" co-author Ricarda Winkelmann says. \"Our analysis shows that even small additional carbon emissions will most likely affect the evolution of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets over tens of thousands of years, and moderate future anthropogenic CO 2 -emissions of 1000 to 1500 Gigatons of Carbon are bound to postpone the next ice age by at least 100.000 years.\"\n\nThe quest for the drivers of glacial cycles remains one of the most fascinating questions of Earth system analysis and especially paleoclimatology, the study of climate changes throughout the entire history of our planet. Usually, the beginning of a new ice age is marked by periods of very low solar radiation in the summer, like at current times. However, at present there is no evidence for the beginning of a new ice age: \"This is the motivation for our study. Unravelling the mystery of the mechanisms driving past glacial cycles also facilitates our ability to predict the next glacial inception,\" Winkelmann says."}

Genes most closely associated with autism spectrum disorders in humans are regulated differently in unresponsive honey bees than in their more responsive nest mates, the study found.\n\nThe findings, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, appear to be unique to genes associated with autism and not to other behavioral disorders in humans. The study offers an early glimpse of the molecular heritage shared across the animal kingdom, the researchers say, and offers tantalizing clues about the evolution of social behavior.\n\n\"Some honey bees are more active than others, and some appear indifferent to intruders that threaten the hive. This, in itself, is not unusual,\" said University of Illinois entomology professor Gene Robinson, who led the new analysis. \"Honey bees take on different roles at different stages of their lifecycle, and not every bee can \u2013 or should \u2013 function as a guard,\" he said.\n\nPostdoctoral researcher Michael Saul, left, IGB director and entomology professor Gene Robinson and their colleagues found that genes that are closely associated with autism spectrum disorders in humans are regulated differently in the brains of socially unresponsive honey bees than in bees that behave more typically. Photo by L. Brian Stauffer Delete Edit embedded media in the Files Tab and re-insert as needed.\n\nBut when postdoctoral researcher Hagai Shpigler observed that some of those same bees also were unmoved by the presence of a queen larva \u2013 a stimulus that typically spurs diligent action in nurse bees \u2013 it suggested something unusual was going on, said Robinson, who directs the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at the U. of I.\n\n\"For any given task, most honey bees fall somewhere in the highly engaged to moderately engaged camp,\" Robinson said. \"Typically, honey bees will respond more robustly to one stimulus than to another.\"\n\nBut a small subset of bees tested by Robinson and his colleagues were either always on \u2013 energetically responding both to intruders and to queen larvae \u2013 or always off, he said.\n\nThe unresponsive bees' lack of social awareness might be seen as similar to the social difficulties faced by some people with autism, Robinson said. But comparing behavior is not enough, he said. Analyzing the genes that drive behavior and how those genes are regulated is key to understanding whether the two phenomena are related.\n\nTo get at this question, the team analyzed 246 groups of bees from seven genetically distinct honey bee colonies, carefully testing each bee in various social contexts, then analyzing levels of gene expression in their brains. They found that more than 1,000 genes were regulated differently between unresponsive bees, nurse bees and guards.\n\nThe researchers next turned to a list of genes and gene expression profiles associated with autism in humans. Their goal was to determine whether a significant proportion of the autism-related genes also played a role in the unresponsive bees.\n\n\"We figured out a way to make an unbiased statistical test that will tell us whether a human gene list and a honey bee gene list overlap more or less than expected by chance,\" said Michael Saul, a postdoctoral researcher who led the statistical analysis with statistics professor Sihai D. Zhao.\n\nThat test revealed significant overlap between the unresponsive honey bees' gene expression profile and genes closely associated with autism in humans. Further analyses found no significant overlap with human genes associated with depression, schizophrenia or several other mental disorders, or with other bee gene lists.\n\n\"Our data are telling us that social unresponsiveness does have some common molecular characteristics in these distantly related species,\" Robinson said.\n\n\"It's important to point out some caveats,\" he said. \"Humans are not big bees and bees are not little humans. The social responsiveness depends on context, and is different in the two cases. Autism spectrum disorder is very complex, and unresponsiveness is not the only behavior associated with it.\"\n\nWhile social behavior likely evolved independently in honey bees and humans, Robinson said, \"our data reveal that they make use of common toolkits, common building blocks.\"\n\n\"What really excites me about this study is that there appears to be this kernel of similarity between us and honey bees, a common animal inheritance that potentially drives social behavior in similar ways,\" Saul said. \"We haven't proven this, but this work is telling us where to look for that in the future.\"\n\nThe Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation supported this research."}

Clay Matthews: Ever since he had his second surgery on his twice broken thumb, it was clear that the Pro Bowl outside linebacker would miss a good part of the offseason. But Matthews said recently that his thumb is healing properly and that he expects to be ready by the start of the regular season. However, that does not answer the question of whether he will be ready for training camp. Matthews said recently that does not expect to have to use a sizable brace on his hand but likely will have to wear some protective covering. Matthews has been at every organized team activity practice open to the media but has not participated in the action.\n\n\"It's kind of week-to-week,\" Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. \"We'll see how he's doing. ... I really don't have a handle on if he'll practice in the offseason or not.\"\n\n2. Nick Perry: This is one of two mysteries on the injured list. Perry finished last season by playing in the final five games (including playoffs) after missing five games because of foot and ankle injuries. Like Matthews, Perry has been at every OTA practice open to the media but has not participated. He also has not been available to reporters, and McCarthy does not reveal injury details in the offseason.\n\n3. Andrew Quarless: Like Perry, Quarless also finished the season on the active roster. He played in all 16 games and became the starting tight end after Jermichael Finley's season-ending neck injury in Week 7. It was the first time Quarless had played since late in the 2011 season, when he blew out his knee and underwent reconstructive knee injury that cost him the entire 2012 season. Quarless has been in attendance at all the OTAs open to the media but has not participated or spoken to reporters.\n\n4. Johnathan Franklin: The second-year running back has not been cleared to return following the neck injury that landed him on injured reserve on Nov. 27. Franklin has been in attendance at all the OTAs open to the media but has not participated or spoken to reporters.\n\nPlayers with new injuries\n\n1. Chris Harper: The second-year receiver who claimed off waivers from the San Francisco 49ers on Oct. 18 of last year was off to a strong start in OTAs until he sustained a hamstring injury last week. \"Harper was making a lot of plays before he tweaked his hamstring,\" quarterback Aaron Rodgers this week.\n\n2. Jumal Rolle: The cornerback who spent 11 weeks on the practice squad before elevated to the active roster late in the season began the offseason in fine health but has not practiced since the first week of OTAs.

Gove and May's show of unity http://t.co/sZ802GkeQE \u2026 pic.twitter.com/IZrrhvoodQ \u2014 Mike Smithson (@MSmithsonPB) June 9, 2014\n\nThe reaction to Trojan Horse has major implications for social policy\n\nMost of the reaction and comment to the fallout from the Birmingham schools Trojan Horse affair has centred on the spat between Theresa May and Michael Gove (and their respective departments), on what 'British values' means, and on to what extent \u2013 if they can be defined \u2013 they should be promoted.\u00a0That's all fair enough but it misses the implicit step already taken: that not only are the values that were sought to be imposed in the schools not British but that neither is there a place for them in a parallel system within the country.\n\nThat may sound obvious now but not that long ago there would have been a lot of noise both from the left-of-centre and from groups purporting to represent ethnic minorities if a politician asserted that some cultures are better than others, or even if they'd said that some cultures are better in this country than others.\u00c2 Yet this week cabinet ministers have effectively said precisely that and it's simply gone practically unchallenged.\u00c2 Multiculturalism \u2013 the idea that many cultures, each of equal value,\u00c2 can and should live side by side, celebrating and retaining their differences \u2013 is dead and buried.\n\nThe implications run far beyond education; questioning what is acceptable behaviour, what imported traditions and behaviours can be accepted, tolerated or celebrated \u2013 and what cannot \u2013 in any field of life. \u00a0While that could apply to any immigrant community (or, for that matter, any indigenous communities that lead sufficiently different and separate lives), there's little doubt the majority of the focus will centre on muslim communities.\n\nIn some ways, that's unfair.\u00a0Apart from the point about other communities, a culture is as much about secular habits as religious teaching.\u00a0However, when culture and religion become deeply intertwined, trying to separate them is both a fruitless and pointless task: the habit reinforces the belief and vice-versa.\u00a0This becomes really tricky territory because it then follows that an attack on one (behaviour) is easily seen and/or represented by those criticised as an attack on the other (their religion).\n\nAnd yet that's precisely where the British Values debate leads, whether the politicians have realised it or not.\u00a0The previous mainstream strategy was to place the divide between 'extreme' Islam and 'conservative' Islam.\u00a0Accepting the British Values premise renders that division irrelevant: it says that the social attitudes of conservative Islam are at best inferior and at worst illegitimate, whether 'extreme' or otherwise.\u00a0It also says that an honest, devout religious belief is still no justification for rejecting the values on which British society is based.\n\nHow all that translates into practical policy is the big question.\u00a0It's all very well to talk in generalities, or ideals, rights, duties, values and traditions but how are schools to promote those values, and what are they, precisely?\u00a0For that matter, if schools are to have a duty to promote British values, then why not other parts of the state?\u00a0What does it mean for policing policy and priorities, for immigration policy, or for when social services departments should intervene, for example?\u00a0Virtually no area of public policy would be untouched.\n\nAt its heart the debate is a revised version of an extremely old question about the conflicts of loyalty and values between state and religion and how to handle those who dissent, especially when there is a violent fringe associated with the dissenters.\u00a0A community that feels persecuted may be more likely to protect their own, especially if they had little confidence in (or need for) the state to start with, producing a situation that leads all too easily where all sides see 'them and us' and the creation of parallel, pseudo-institutions in the state's place.\u00a0Integration is the only real answer but for that to happen there has to be a desire for it on the one side and a welcoming and open acceptance on the other.\u00a0What the Trojan Horse episode tells us \u2013 and it's by no means an isolated incident \u2013 is that we're a long way from such a position.\n\nSo far, the proposal's received a remarkable lack of criticism.\u00a0Perhaps that's because it's difficult to knock the principle without upsetting many other people; far easier to wait for the detail.\u00a0Whether that's sustainable as we head into an election year is another matter.\n\nDavid Herdson"}

So it was a bit of a surprise when I moved to Japan, a country that arguably buys into the concept of Disney magic more wholeheartedly than any other, and met multiple people, generally women, who said the costumed performers were their least favorite part of a visit to Disneyland. \"Mickey dances around and acts so cute,\" they'd say, \"but what if there's some middle-aged guy inside?\"\n\nPersonally, I'd say a middle-aged man is still far less appalling than an actual human-sized rodent would be, but somehow that age/gender combination was always held up as the worst possible reality that could be hiding inside the suit.\n\nMeanwhile, in China, Disney fans have come flocking to one Mickey Mouse performer with an even more surprising identity: a 75-year-old woman.\n\nPart of the appeal of a trip to Disneyland is knowing that you're going to experience the utmost levels of customer service, all in an effort to preserve the illusion that the studio's animated fantasy worlds have come to life. This requires some pretty strict regulations for park employees, and rumors say it's a fireable offense for a performer to remove his or her costume's head in front of guests.\n\nThings are apparently a little more lax, in terms of both employee conduct and intellectual property rights, at Wangcheng Park in Luoyang City in China. While we don't know if the character's official name is Mickey or not, we do know that visitors can shake hands and get a hug from a wide-eyed, formal-attire wearing black mouse who wanders the grounds. Excited fans can even snap a picture with the cute rodent for a fee of 15 yuan (US $2.40).\n\n\u25bc Because Mickey's gotta get that cheddar so he can buy that cheese.\n\nOf course, entertaining is hard work, and those costumes get awfully hot and sweaty inside. So if you hang around Wangcheng Park long enough, you just might catch the performer peeling off the two-kilogram (4.4-pound) headpiece for a breath of fresh air.\n\nIt turns out that not only is pseudo-Mickey really a girl, she's also 75. The loveable character's secret identity is Zhi-Qiao Yang, who divorced her husband 18 years ago and currently lives with her 40-year-old son.\n\nAlthough eligible for government welfare, Yang's work ethic is too strong for her to stop working entirely. \"I don't want to be a burden to my kid, and since my body is still in good shape, I want to earn an income,\" says the cheerful and industrious senior, who sells toys near the park's gate when not in costume. Yang also mentions that her son is still single, and she hopes to one day put her savings towards his wedding.\n\nRather than feel betrayed by revelation of who's been inside the costume all along, visitors to the park have made Yang into a sort of local celebrity. Her biggest admirers, moved by both her devotion to family and spirit of self-reliance, have even taken to calling her Grandma Mickey.\n\nWe suppose that makes Yang's fans her grandchildren. Judging by her selflessness, we're sure she's got a big enough heart to love them all right back.\n\nWe just hope she doesn't feel obligated to pay for all their wedding ceremonies, too.\n\nSources, images: Lyd, Weibo (1, 2)\n\n[ Read in Japanese ]"}

JESSICA GRIFFIN / Staff Photographer\n\nFormer Congressman Chaka Fattah exits federal court after being sentenced to 10 years in prison, in Philadelphia, on December 12, 2016. JESSICA GRIFFIN / Staff Photographer\n\nAs night follows day, I knew Monday's sentencing of Congressman Chaka Fattah to 10 years in prison would generate a firestorm of comments implicating the Inquirer and Daily News in Fattah's betrayal of the public trust.\n\nSure enough, when Fattah's sentence was announced, the Philly.com commentariat declared that both news outlets should be hanging our heads in shame because, after all, we endorsed him! I can't tell how how many times this response \u2013 Your fault! You endorsed him/her! \u2014 dominates the comments sections of stories detailing the latest lawmaker to be indicted or sentenced on corruption charges.\n\nActually, that's not true, I can tell you: Every. Single. Time. Kathleen Kane? Our fault. LeAnna Washington? Our fault. Vince Fumo? John Perzel? Yup, we did it. We endorsed these criminals, so that must make us practically co-conspirators. Right? Well, not exactly.\n\nI have presided over the endorsement process for the Daily News for over a decade. Here's how it works (I can't speak for my colleagues at the Inquirer, but I do know they, and news organizations elswhere, follow a similar pattern).\n\nBefore meeting with candidates, we research their records and backgrounds. Then we ask them pointed questions, and not just about the issues that appear in soundbites on their websites or commercials. Often, opposing candidates are invited in together, so we can challenge both at the same time. Then we deliberate, and make our choice.\n\nWe believe that even if the choices aren't great, it's our responsibilty to make an endorsement anyway. To make no endorsement is to say \"don't vote for either,\" which is too close to saying \"don't vote.\" And we would never suggest that not voting is an option.\n\nSometimes candidates challenging an incumbent are smart and promising, and sometimes they're not. But we always give these earnest candidates a full hearing, because they represent democracy in action. Here's an ugly truth, though: Too often, people running for office aren't serious contenders. Some don't show up for endorsement meetings, or don't respond to phone calls. Others that do show are clearly unqualified, or seem to have no clue about the function of the office they're running for.\n\nThat goes for both Republicans and Democrats. Both parties often put forth token candidates with no real hope of challenging a powerful incumbent. We don't like that situation any more than you do. In fact, we have repeatedly made the point that the Democratic and Republican machines in this city have become lazy and moribund, more interested in holding onto power than representing the people \u2013 whether in the highest offices in the city or in enclaves like the parking authority. All that spells a broken democracy. But we didn't break it. And like you, we're not buying it.\n\nSandra Shea is the editorial page editor of the Daily News."}

But Harper has moved beyond those traditional corridors and has focused on a stronger and more independent Canadian foreign policy.\n\nPart of this new independent foreign policy has been supporting Israel, an often-unpopular position around the world. Immediately upon taking office in 2006, Harper bucked world opinion and supported Israel in its war against the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah. This outward support has continued in every military engagement Israel has been involved in since.\n\nCanada has also supported Israel in the U.N., joining only a handful of small nations and the U.S. in voting against upgrading the Palestinians to nonmember observer state status in 2012, and repeatedly voting against resolutions condemning Israel.\n\nOn Iran, Harper has aligned more closely with Israel's position than with the positions of some its allies in Europe and the U.S. In 2012, Harper cut diplomatic ties with Iran and expelled Iranian diplomats from Ottawa, Canada's capital. More recently, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird said he was \"deeply skeptical\" of the interim nuclear deal with Iran and reaffirmed that Canada would maintain its sanctions against Iran.\n\nThese positions have come with some costs for Canada. In a shocking outcome in 2010, Canada lost a bid for a seat on the U.N. Security Council. Some speculated that Harper's strong pro-Israel stance might have played a role in straining relations with the U.N.'s large Islamic bloc.\n\n\"This is really something we have not seen before, a prime minister of Canada taking a really strong position at a great political cost. He knows that this could really hurt him in some areas, but he doesn't care, because this is what he really believes,\" Scheim told JNS.org.\n\nHarper, an Evangelical Christian who belongs to the Colorado-based Christian and Missionary Alliance church, has also come under fire from critics who claim that his faith influences his foreign policy.\n\n\"My sense is that there may be an element of religious connection [to Israel]. But that is certainly not all of it; I think it also has to do with his sense of the world, his sense of justice and understanding of history, especially Jewish history,\" Scheim said.\n\nBut Canada, like its American and European allies, still has a vocal anti-Israel movement within the country, particularly on college campuses and in certain media outlets.\n\nIn 2005, Toronto's York University became the first school to host \"Israel Apartheid Week\" (IAW) and its student union, the largest in Canada, voted last year to divest from Israel. IAW events have also spread to other Canadian universities.\n\nHarper's recent selection of Vivian Bercovici, who is Jewish and has been a vocal supporter of Israel, to be Canada's next ambassador to Israel has also drawn some criticism in the Canadian media. In an interview with Baird, CBC anchor Evan Solomon questioned whether it is appropriate to appoint a pro-Israel Jew to be the Ambassador to Israel.\n\n\"Vivian Bercovici is Jewish, so there are going to be some questions. Why not appoint someone who doesn't even have the perception of any kind of bias (in favor of Israel)?\" Solomon asked.\n\nYet despite the criticism of Harper's pro-Israel stance, Shimon Fogel, CEO of Canada's Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, credits Harper for making support for Israel a mainstream position in Canada.\n\n\"Adopting those positions on Israel is what a mainstream party should look like in the eyes of most of the Canadian electorate today,\" Fogel JNS.org.\n\nThis support has shown itself in the positions of the leaders of Canada's two main opposition parties, the centrist Liberal Party and the center-left New Democratic Party (NDP).\n\n\"Yes, the Liberal Party will have Israel's back\u2014but not because it's in our political interests to do so at home, but because it is the right thing to do on the world stage,\" Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau recently told a crowd of 500 people at Beth Tikvah Synagogue in Toronto, the Jewish Tribune of Toronto reported.\n\nMeanwhile, NDP leader Thomas Mulcair has strong Jewish ties. Mulcair's wife is a French Sephardic Jew whose parents are Holocaust survivors, and his children are being raised Jewish. Mulcair has described himself as an \"ardent support of Israel in all instances.\"\n\nAdding to their credentials, both Trudeau and Mulcair have also visited Israel before.\n\n\"The opposition parties are very close to the position of the Conservative government [on Israel]. But it has to be recognized that this government [Harper's Conservative party]"}

He also treated victims of last July's movie theater shooting in Aurora, where a dozen were killed and 58 were wounded.\n\nBut he doesn't just treat the victims \u2014 often, he'll also treat the shooter after he or she has been caught by police. Colwell describes a case from a few months ago where he treated a woman \u2014 who later died \u2014 and her husband, the shooter.\n\n\"They had had a fight. He had caught her in what he felt was cheating, and he had lost his temper,\" he says. \"He went and grabbed the pistol that he had for home defense at his bedside, and he made a snap decision, and he realized his life will never be the same, and hers was gone.\"\n\nHe says it's remarkable how often people who pull the trigger are surprised at the consequences of their actions.

My Red Velvetine from Lime Crime finally arrived! Yay! First, can I just rave about how cute the little packaging is? The red and white almost gives off a Christmas feel to me. I kind of don't want to throw the box away because it's just so darn adorable. It also came with this cute watermelon button with the words Lime Crime on it.\nI absolutely love how the tube is in matte and the packaging itself matches the box. It is so beautiful. I loved how they engraved a unicorn at the top too.\nSo cool right?\nIt came in a doe foot applicator which I do love. It helps me make a more precise application that a brush does or those flat wide applicators. It also had a subtle sweet scent, almost as if it was candy. I kept sniffing the product when I first opened it because it just smelled so sweet. There was about 0.11 oz of product inside the tube and it's vegan and cruelty free. I'll be honest, I actually did drop the tube when I first opened it because it rolled off my table when I was getting the lights. I freaked out a bit because I was expecting it to crack since I thought the tube was made of glass. But the package is still intact and is perfectly so yay, happy about that.\nSo pre-applicaction, I made sure my lips were moisturized. Pleaseeeeeee excuse the peach fuzz and the patchy areas under my nose. I just quickly applied some foundation to remove the redness off my face for the sake of this review. Remember to moisturize your lips daily and at least exfoliate it weekly to have a smooth application. Your lips will thank you :)\nHonestly, when I first applied it, it did have a really nice velvet feel but I wasn't sure if it was from the product itself or the applicator tip. This is a gorgeous shade of red, like a rose, which is where they got their inspiration from. It comes in the form of a liquid lipstick and it's supposed to dry matte, which was why I LOVED the idea of the matte packaging itself. I did have to apply two coats for it to become an opaque color. After applying the first coat I noticed there were some areas where my natural lip peaked through and it was slightly uneven so that bothered me. But it wasn't a big deal, just swipe on another layer. I gave it a while to dry while I cleaned up the edges a bit. I didn't use a lip liner for this.\nAfter it dried, it came out as a nice soft matte texture. Some color did come off when I kissed the back of my hand but it wasn't enough to remove the products off my lips. I'm hoping this would be a long lasting thing, a lip color that would last through the day and you wouldn't need to reapply after meals. I do have a bad habit of forgetting to bring the lip color I'm wearing when I go out so I end up having plain dry lips by the end of the day with patchy hues from my previous lipsticks. I think the only thing I don't like about this product though is that when it was dry, it still had a bit of stickiness when I pressed my lips together. Like you can feel the product clinging onto each other as your lips rolled off the other. I do adore the finish though and the color is amazing. It's so pigmented.\nHere's a shot without flash. I have a yellowish light bulb so my skin tone looks more yellow. You can definitely see the patchiness from my foundation here. No primer and concealer. But the lip product itself still looks fantastic. I absolutely love matte products rather than gloss. Overall, I would so recommend this to my friends and you! I give it a 8/10. I'm thinking about getting Suede Berry next and hoping that the pink one will come out soon too. Super happy with my purchase. What are your favorite lip products? Leave a comment below! Hope you'll all have a great week. Bye! :D"}

They hit \"Frank\": Frank Hunt had been badly wounded in the same mine incident.\n\nA few months later Schumann was passing through Hunt's home town of Bega on the south coast of NSW.\n\n\"I have to say Frank was not all that keen on opening the door to a long-haired, left-wing pinko,\" said Schumann.\n\nSchumann got out his guitar and Mr Hunt's reaction was the same as Mr Storen's.\n\n\"He wanted to hear it again and again until I begged him to allow me to play it into a cassette so I could stop playing it.\"\n\nAfter the song's release Mr Hunt helped Schumann promote the song.\n\n\"Obviously they had some pretty deep and meaningful conversations, otherwise he would not have come out with a ripper of a song like that,\" said Mr Hunt.\n\nWelcome home\n\nOn October 3, 1987, 25,000 Vietnam veterans marched through the streets of Sydney in a belated welcome home parade.\n\nIt was four years after the release of I was only 19 and 15 years after Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war ended.\n\nAfter the march, Schumann played I was only 19 at a concert in the Domain.\n\nFrank Hunt was beside him, on stage in his wheelchair.

It seems a simple, even unassailable idea: Who would rise to argue in favor of a method of minimum likelihood, or even mediocre likelihood? And yet the mathematical history of the topic shows this \"simple idea\" is really anything but simple. Joseph Louis Lagrange, Daniel Bernoulli, Leonard Euler, Pierre Simon Laplace and Carl Friedrich Gauss are only some of those who explored the topic, not always in ways we would sanction today. In this article, that history is reviewed from back well before Fisher to the time of Lucien Le Cam's dissertation. In the process Fisher's unpublished 1930 characterization of conditions for the consistency and efficiency of maximum likelihood estimates is presented, and the mathematical basis of his three proofs discussed. In particular, Fisher's derivation of the information inequality is seen to be derived from his work on the analysis of variance, and his later approach via estimating functions was derived from Euler's Relation for homogeneous functions. The reaction to Fisher's work is reviewed, and some lessons drawn."}

They are slated to become part of Georgia Aquarium's breeding \"inventory,\" with some distributed to partner aquariums, including Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, IL, and SeaWorld facilities in Orlando, FL, San Antonio, TX, and San Diego, CA.\n\nThe Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits activities that result in unnecessary risk to the health and welfare of marine mammals. This import is both unnecessary and poses substantial risk to the health and welfare of these animals and the groups from which they were taken. Russian capture methods are notoriously inhumane, involving driving methods to herd the animals to shore, which causes panic and distress, physical harm, and even death. The animals will also be forced to endure a grueling journey from Russia to the United States, including a stopover with carrier and plane changes in Belgium. In total, the animals will have to survive over 30 hours in transit, involving multiple plane and truck rides and carrier changes. As for the beluga population from which these animals have been taken, it is still recovering from years of hunting; the removal of such a large number of animals from the same area may result in the disruption of social groups and the loss of important genetic material and learned behaviors passed down through generations.\n\nUnited States public display facilities have not imported wild-caught belugas (or any other cetacean) for display since 1993, and the current situation is an abhorrently regressive step for animal welfare in this country. As the entertainment industry continues its attempts to breed belugas in captivity, the population of captive belugas in the United States has actually declined\u2014from 40 animals in the early 1990s to 35 today. This is a clear indication that the stress of capture and transport along with confinement are not conducive to thriving and reproducing.\n\nAnimals deprived of their pod mates and natural environment often exhibit aberrant behaviors. Captive belugas suffer from stress, poor health, and increased mortality. Wild belugas can expect to live up to about 60 years\u2014a lifespan never achieved by any captive beluga. Other countries, including Chile, Costa Rica and most recently Switzerland, are recognizing that belugas and other cetaceans do not belong in captivity, especially as trained performers, and are banning the practice. In an era when wild cetaceans are celebrated, Georgia Aquarium and its partners are way behind the curve to even consider this capture and import.\n\nGeorgia Aquarium justifies the import as an important contribution to \"marine conservation and public education,\" yet there is no accepted evidence to show that the experience of seeing captive animals exhibited for entertainment has any educational benefit.\n\nFurther, there are currently at least 40 belugas living in reported sub-standard conditions at a facility in Niagara Falls, Ontario. If Georgia Aquarium and its partners were truly concerned about marine conservation, they would urge the rehabilitation and release of the wild Russian belugas, while working to improve conditions for the animals held in Canada. To obtain and transport 18 wild animals from half-way around the world, when several dozen are languishing just over the border and could perhaps be taken by Georgia Aquarium and its partners, is ludicrous, and clearly not conservation.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO:\n\nPlease urge Georgia Aquarium to abandon its plans to import these animals. Tell it that beluga whales should not be puppets of an entertainment industry profiting under the guise of conservation and education, while ripping the animals away from their families, homes, and freedom. Importing 18 wild-caught beluga whales captured from a recovering population from Russia is not the way to promote conservation and education.

The case focuses on two well known personalities: Dennis Luxford, the Editor of the salacious newspaper rag \"The Source\" and Eve Bowen a power hungry, up and coming MP who is Undersecretary of State for the Home Office of the Conservative Party, one of their most powerful Junior Ministers. The problem all stems from a rollicking week of steamy sex the two had while attending a Tory Conference in Blackpool eleven years ago. At the time, neither really cared much for the other, it was all about each meeting their own physical needs. When they left the conference neither intended to see the other again. But when Luxford discovered that Bowen was pregnant, he met with her once to offer her whatever support she needed. Bowen refused his help and said she never wanted to see him again. So Luxford has never met Charlotte the ten year old daughter he fathered so long ago and Bowen has kept Charlotte's parentage a closely guarded secret for years.\n\n\nAs readers meet Dennis Luxford in his London office, he is relishing the coup he landed when his investigative reporter discovered a Conservative MP in the romantic throws of a harem boy in the back seat of a parked car. The news was splashed across the headlines of the sleazy paper and the circulation numbers at The Source soared. Luxford has a great dislike for the Tory Party and will do anything to disgrace them. But the morning post brings Luxford an unexpected message. Someone has abducted Charlotte and is demanding that Luxford reveal the child's parentage in an article on the front page of the newspaper the next day or he will kill her. Bowen has received the same message. Revealing this news will be painful for Luxford who is happily married to the beautiful Fiona and has an eight year old son named Leo. But for Bowen, revelation of their past affair will be much more devastating. It will ruin her career in politics and may even bring down the government which is still reeling from the disclosure about the MP found in the backseat of his car with his pants down in the company of an underage boy. The Tory Party was elected to government based on a platform of strong family values but it seems their Ministers are having trouble towing the line. Luxford and his team are having a field day uncovering stories about MPs with mistresses, illegitimate children, shady real estate deals and questionable ties to industry. Another scandal involving a Conservative would be a disaster.\n\n\nLuxford is ready to meet the demands of the kidnapper and run the news in his paper but Bowen refuses to go along with the plan. She believes that Luxford himself is behind the entire ruse and she is ready to call his bluff, convinced Luxford is holding Charlotte and trying to get her to believe her daughter is in danger. She is determined not to bow to his dirty tactics. Luxford does whatever he can to convince her that her child's life is at stake but she is not prepared to lose the career she has taken so long to build. Even her husband Alex Stone, who has looked on Charlotte as his own daughter cannot convince her and she refuses to contact the police. She insists the entire affair is a hoax generated by Luxford to smear the government and to increase the circulation of his newspaper. Luxford approaches Simon St. James for some help to keep the entire mess out of the public eye. Although Simon feels strongly that the police should be called and that such an investigation is out of his depth, he bows to the pressure of his wife Deborah and agrees to see what he can do.

No wonder the latest survey of scientists by the Pew Research Center found scientists increasingly pessimistic about how their work is viewed in the wider society.\n\nIn the latest organised attack on science, 14 senior US scientists are being targeted by anti-GM lobby group US Right to Know (USRTK), an offshoot of the failed California GM labelling campaign Yes on 37. USRTK is using the Freedom of Information Act (FoIA) to demand access to years of private emails and other correspondence of these scientists, undoubtedly aiming to undermine their credentials and sully their names in public.\n\nAs three former presidents of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, we know how important it is for scientists to engage meaningfully in societal debates about their work. But we also know how important it is for scientists to be able to speak freely in conducting their work, both publicly and privately. USRTK's attack is reminiscent of 'Climategate', where the release of private emails did immense, unwarranted damage to the reputations of climate scientists. Now the vocal anti-GM lobby appears to be taking a page out of the Climategate playbook.\n\nThe facts are clear: the scientific consensus on the safety of foods derived from GM plants is equivalent to that on global climate change driven by human activities. The AAAS has issued statements on both subjects, underscoring that climate change is real and that GM technology is safe. Numerous other learned societies and public bodies have reached the same conclusions and continue to be attacked by science deniers on both issues.\n\nUSRTK's statements are unambiguous \u2013 it views any scientist with the temerity to speak out in public on biotechnology as part of \"the PR machine for the chemical-agro industry\". Hence its FoIA requests focus on any email exchanges with biotech companies such as Monsanto, Syngenta, and DuPont, as well as other organisations, including the Grocery Manufacturers Association and the Council for Biotechnology Information. These researchers have denied receiving hidden funding from these groups, yet a good deal of damage can be done with private communications quoted out of context.\n\nIronically, USRTK is less eager to reveal its own agenda and funding. Its website reveals only one donor, the Organic Consumers Association (OCA), a group that seeks to turn US agriculture 100% organic and eliminate GM crops. It is clearly promoting the interests of the organic food business, now a $63bn (\u00a342bn) dollar industry.\n\nThe OCA has a clear game plan \u2013 to drive increased sales of higher-priced organic produce by convincing consumers that conventionally farmed foods are swimming in pesticide residues, that GM crops are dangerous, and that biotechnology companies that sell GM seeds are evil. But OCA does not restrict its anti-science activities to agriculture. Its website is also riddled with anti-vaccine misinformation, for example that \"it is important to know how to protect your children and yourself with homeopathic and natural alternatives to vaccines to build your natural immunity\" and other such dangerous nonsense.\n\nMoreover, OCA's assertion that we can feed the world organically and without modern technology is nothing short of delusional. We live on a finite planet with a human population of 7.2bn, a number that is increasing by almost 100,000 per day. Our ability to minimise the effects of famine has depended on the application of science and technology to agriculture since the time of the Industrial Revolution two centuries ago. The key innovations have been in genetics and plant breeding, synthetic fertilisers, and farm mechanisation.\n\nA recent meta-analysis concluded that adoption of GM crops since 1996 has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yields by 22% and increased farmer profits by 68%. Moreover, the gains were larger for developing countries than developed countries. We need more science, not less, if we are to feed the coming world of 9.5bn in 2050 without further destroying fragile ecosystems and driving more species to extinction.\n\nHostile challenges to intellectual enterprises such as universities and the people who practice science within them are hugely detrimental to our ability to make rational, evidence-based decisions in free societies.\n\nIf we allow ideologically-motivated campaigners to harass and threaten our leading thinkers and intellectual institutions, there will be less progress than we could otherwise achieve. Our civilisation can do better than that. We want to be able to vision a healthy, sustainable and vibrant"}

I appreciate that y'all have been patient with me. I was not in my element to film, but now I am back. I hope y'all connect with me on my Instagram page @ strawberryheartschocolatedarts , where I post on a daily basis. Today on the Chai Time menu: Kokie Professional Cosmetics. \u00a0 \u00a0\nI first discovered the brand Kokie Cosmetics through posts on Instagram that showcased the brand's beautiful nail polish selection. I started following the brand on Instagram and learned that their nail polishes \u2013 a select variety - are sold in select Bed, Bad, and Beyond Harmon's stores. \u00a0 So I ventured out to my local BBB Harmon's to check the Kokie Cosmetics nail polishes, but the colors that I was interested in were not available at the locations near me. \u00a0 This took Kokie Cosmetics off my radar until this past Spring when the brand announced on Instagram that they not only have nail polishes, but makeup and brushes too, which would soon be releasing in select Walmart locations. Soon after their announcement, Kokie Cosmetics displays were spotted at Walmart stores. Hence, my hunt commenced! \u00a0\nTo find out if a Walmart near you carries Kokie, visit the Kokie Cosmetics website, select the Walmart tab, and enter your zip code. \u00a0 This is how I searched for a display near me rather than hopping from store to store, wasting my time. \u00a0 I really appreciate that Kokie Cosmetics has this locator feature on their website because unfortunately Walmart is so disorganized in my opinion. \u00a0 I am a Target gal, no ifs or buts about it!\nNow let us circle back to today's video. \u00a0 I was able to find a display right after it had been freshly set up. \u00a0 For those of you familiar with the chaos that is Walmart \u2013especially its makeup isles, which sometimes look like a storm has passed through \u2013 will appreciate the sanctity of a fresh untouched display. \u00a0 I got to the apples first y'all, fresh and juicy for the picking.\nAlthough I would have liked to try several products, I limited myself to just the liquid lipsticks. \u00a0 I am not much of a base wearer nor do I like to switch it up much \u2013 I stick to what works. \u00a0 The color products, like the eye shadows and blushes, didn't speak to me because they appeared better suited for lighter, fairer skin-tones. \u00a0 Also, I am a fledgling beauty blogger and invest my own money in purchasing products to test and review so I cannot get carried away. \u00a0 Basically, I am a lipstick gal and that's what triggered my love for makeup artistry and blogging. \u00a0 So let us take a look at what I picked up, shall we?\nKokie Cosmetics has two formulations of liquid lipsticks: the Kissable Liquid Lipstick and the Lip Poudre . \u00a0\n\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Kissable Liquid Lipstick claims \u2013 \"love the matte look but not desert-dry lips? Never fear, Kokie Cosmetics is here with our Kissable Matte Lip Gloss! These liquid lipsticks glide on like velvet and dry into a soft, kissable matte \u2026 Comfortable, transfer-proof\u2026 \" (Kokie Professional website)\n\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lip Poudre claims \u2013 \"our formula provides water-resistant, intensely pigmented, weightless color that wont flake or dry out lips. Plus, it's reapplication-friendly! Glides on as a cream and dries to a feather-light, velvety soft, matte lipstick.\" (Kokie Professional website)\nLet me give it to y'all straight, if you have dry lips, despite your efforts to keep them hydrated, and most (like 99%) matte liquid lipsticks do not suit you, then the Kissable Liquid Lipstick formula is ideal for you. The Kissable formula has a gel-cream hybrid texture. \u00a0 It's gel-like characteristic is what makes it adhere well to the lips so initially it has that slight tackiness of a gloss and you can feel it on your lips. \u00a0 It takes a few minutes to set to a semi-matte finish. \u00a0 Although it is very comfortable as Kokie Cosmetics claims, it is not transfer-proof. \u00a0 If you don't like your lipsticks to have sheen and prefer that they set completely matte, then you will not be a fan of the Kissable formula. \u00a0\nThe Lip Poudre formula is difficult to explain. In fact, it is somewhat \"powdery\" as its name implies. \u00a0 It has a thinner, more of a liquid-cream consistency in comparison to the Kissable formula. \u00a0 However, once it sets, it felt and looked gritty and enhanced every nook and cranny of my lips. \u00a0 I loved the Lip Poudre color Duchess, but despite being such a"}

His 61 year-old wife of 29 years has been living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) since being diagnosed at age 30. Against doctor's expectations, they were blessed with the joy of having two completely healthy sons (us).MS is a progressive neurological autoimmune disease which affects motor control, energy level, cognitive abilities, and more. The disease carries with it many side effects, including (but not limited to) arthritis, incontinence, numbness in the feet and hands, brain fog, and extreme fatigue. Over the course of 30 years, Mom has gone from being a world traveler, gifted artist, and highly-involved mother to spending her days bedridden and depressed. It has been decades since she's been able to operate a motor vehicle, and is presently unable to walk or even lift herself.Treating this condition is never cheap (medication, physical therapy, neurologists, surgeries, part-time nurses, etc.). For over 25 years, Dad has been the sole provider and caregiver for our family of four. Caring for his lovely wife, unfortunately, has taken an incredible mental, physical, and financial toll.They currently reside in our childhood home. The house is too large for them to manage, let alone afford. It is not accessible for our mother, who can only get around in a wheelchair.After being a victim of a large company downsizing, our Dad (66) has been unsuccessful finding comparable employment. The best job he found requires him to commute about 80 miles daily for inadequate pay. Unless something changes, he will have to work this job until the day he dies.Our goal for them is to move them to a smaller, MS-friendly, active senior community where they can thrive and regain fiscal stability. The first step is to find a new home. After that, we can prepare their current house for sale by:* Reducing the amount of clutter accumulated from two lifetimes* Sanitizing the home & pest extermination* Replacing carpets & repainting interior walls* Electrical repairs* Inspections and other necesscary repairsWe hope to do this as affordably and quickly as possible. Most of the labor will be provided by us (their sons), and our significant others.Most commonly, people in this situation would be older and more established, thus able to better contribute financially. Unfortunately, this is not the case for us. All of us are in our early twenties, and some of us are still in school. We will all be taking significant time off of school and work to make this possible.It is our hope that with your help, we can celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary in their clean, accessible, and affordable home.Thank you & God bless."}

A Moorefield Police Officer conducted the traffic stop in the parking lot of the local Sheetz convenience store.\n\n\"Subsequent to the traffic stop a question arose involving a narcotics possession which led to the arrest of the driver,\" said Moorefield Police Chief Steven Reckart. \"During the arrest process, the suspect became combative and non-compliant with the arresting officer. The arresting officer of the Moorefield Police Department and a West Virginia State Trooper were able to regain control at the scene momentarily, but the driver managed to escape and flee on foot.\"\n\nThe driver is identified as Tyler Riggleman, 26, of Moorefield.\n\nWhile the arrest unfolded, Kelly Kipp went inside the store and started to record video of the incident. He told a different story.\n\n\"The officer and the driver were wrestling around on the ground,\" he said. \"When I got in the store, I started to record and the suspect is on the ground holding the dog to stop him from biting him.\"\n\nKipp claimed the Moorefield officer released her K-9 on Riggleman and his video begins as the officer pulls the dog away. The trooper took control of Riggleman while the Moorefield officer, with her gun drawn, ordered one of the two passengers in the vehicle to sit on the ground in front of her cruiser.\n\nAround the same time, Riggleman made his escape on foot and the dog was released a second time, only this time according to Kipp, the dog attacked the trooper instead of the suspect. Moorefield police had no 't comment on the dog's action. Kipp's video didn't show the trooper being attacked by the dog nor did it show what happened next.\n\n\"She gets the dog off the state trooper, gets the dog back in the vehicle, gets in the vehicle and I could not believe what I was seeing,\" said Kipp. \"She ran right up over the top of his (passenger) right shoulder, arm, and up around the side of his neck and face. I thought, 'Oh my God she just killed him.'\"\n\n\"They had been placed in a prone position on the ground,\" said Reckart. \"When the driver fled, an officer jumped in the vehicle and attempted to pursue the fleeing suspect. She misjudged and ran over his arm.\"\n\nReckart declined to identify the passenger who was run over. MetroNews has learned from Jerry Riggleman, the father of Tyler Riggleman, the victim is Jason Fellows, 31, who lives with the elder Riggleman. Fellows was reportedly treated and released with a broken finger and injuries to his arm.\n\nMr. Riggleman claime the family found his son the following morning still handcuffed and passed out along the railroad track nearby.\n\n\"About 5:30 or 6 o'clock the next morning about half froze to death,\" Riggleman said. \"He had a pair of pants, no shoes, no shirt,and a pair of handcuffs behind his back.\"\n\nRiggleman claimed his son has had run ins with local law enforcement before, including an incident two years ago in which he claimed his son was attacked by a police dog while handcuffed.\n\n\"Since then, they have aggravated this kid and harassed him,\" Riggleman said. \"He said, 'Dad they weren't going to put that dog on me again.\"\n\nTyler Riggleman faced felony and misdemeanor charges from the incident. Reckart said he remained at large. The elder Riggleman said his son planned to turn himself in after finding an attorney to help him through the legal process.\n\nThe officer remained on active duty, according to Reckart, but as of Wednesday was on her regular days off.\n\n\"We are working it right now, doing an internal as well as a criminal investigation,\" said Reckart."}

{"id": 1181, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Thomas Dimitroff's job hung in the balance. It was January of 2015, and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank was searching for a new head coach, refusing to make any promises about his general manager's status. NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported at the time that the new coach would have a say in Dimitroff's future. Blank didn't realize that Dimitroff already had laid the foundation for a Super Bowl run with his 2014 draft class.\n\nDimitroff wound up keeping his gig with reduced power. New coach Dan Quinn was given control of the 53-man roster and reported directly to Blank. Scott Pioli, Dimitroff's close friend, assumed greater responsibility with the NFL draft and pro scouting. Dimitroff's status remained precarious after Quinn piloted the Falcons to an 8-8 season in 2015, requiring Blank to pen a statement after the season simply to say Dimitroff wasn't getting fired. His excellent working relationship with Quinn was cited as the primary reason. But the team's recent drafts should have been.\n\nThe 2016 Falcons proved once again how quickly NFL teams can hashtag rise up with a few good drafts, especially when a franchise quarterback is in place. Only six current starters were on the team in 2013. Dimitroff and Pioli unearthed 10 starters in the last three drafts, highlighted by Pro Bowl running back Devonta Freeman, Pro Bowl linebacker Vic Beasley and left tackle Jake Matthews. Nearly half of Atlanta's roster, 22 players on the active roster, were added to the team this season. That includes four rookie starters selected in the first four rounds of the 2016 NFL Draft.\n\nFortunes can change fast on the field when teams stay patient off it. The Falcons soared this season partly because Blank didn't make wholesale changes in 2015, giving another chance to Dimitroff, the man who previously oversaw the greatest sustained success in team history. From the hot seat in June to a three-year contract extension in November, Dimitroff is back on top of the NFL executive mountain. Here's a look at how he and Pioli built this explosive roster:\n\nAnd while I'm at it, the Falcons roster building is below. Last 2 years have been incredible: pic.twitter.com/FT35uMbL4G \u2014 Gregg Rosenthal (@greggrosenthal) January 31, 2017\n\n\u00bb The hiring of Quinn gave clarity to the personnel department. Dimitroff told NFL Network at the Senior Bowl last week that Quinn's \"crystal clear\" vision for what he wanted forced the Falcons' front office to look for different traits and players than they did before.\n\nSince Quinn's arrival, the Falcons have rebuilt their defense by valuing playing speed and energy above all other skills. Beasley, cornerback Jalen Collins, safety Keanu Neal, linebacker Deion Jones and linebacker De'Vondre Campbell are all \"urgent\" players drafted in the last two years who will start on Super Bowl Sunday. The defensive results didn't match Atlanta's potential for most of the season, but the young pieces augur better days ahead.\n\n\u00bb That need for speed extends to the offense, as well. 2015 third-round running back Tevin Coleman, rookie tight end Austin Hooper and free-agent wide receiver pickups Taylor Gabriel and Aldrick Robinson are all burners. The Falcons have embraced their status as a dome team, and it's paying off in a postseason that will not include a game played outdoors.\n\n\u00bb Finding three worthy starters in any draft cycle is considered a success. The Falcons might have found nine over the last two seasons, depending on how they view Coleman and upstart undrafted rookie cornerback Brian Poole. Dimitroff should be able to keep this core group together for a few more years.\n\n\u00bb Gabriel is part of a ridiculously productive 2016 free agency crop. The Falcons found quality starters by spending big money (Alex Mack, Mohamed Sanu) and acquired key reserves on the cheap. The 36-year-old Dwight Freeney was Atlanta's best pass rusher in the NFC Championship Game. Gabriel, a castoff from Cleveland, was claimed off waivers in September before transforming into a big-play X-factor for the Falcons.\n\n\u00bb There's no one way to build an offensive line. Guard Andy Levitre, who had a great 2016 season, was acquired via trade in 2015 from the Titans when his value was at an absolute low. The Falcons only had to give up a sixth-rounder and a future conditional pick for him. Left tackle Jake Matthews was a top-10 pick. Center Alex Mack was a big-money free-agent pickup, while Chris Chester was a bargain-bin signing. Right tackle Ryan Schraeder, who arrived as an undrafted free agent, earned a big extension in November.\n\n\u00bb It's crazy that only three current Falcons players predate the 2011 draft-day trade that netted Atlanta Julio Jones."}

When it's all done you'll be able to make money and start your life.\" By the time that day actually came, I was so underwhelmed with the college experience that I didn't even bother to show up.\n\nAt least real life had started. And I was off to the races\u2026 not really. I had to move back in with my mom because I hadn't made any job plans and didn't feel motivated to sign up for twp more years of college. I basically spent a year screwing off before deciding I needed a Master's Degree. With that degree I eventually ended up working at a college. Now, at 29 years old, I'm getting ready to leave to do something huge and I finally feel prepared for it because of the lessons I've learned here.\n\nIn the last four years I've met people who are in their early 20s who I consider peers and equals; people who organize groups, throw giant successful events and still have time to kick school's ass; people who study abroad for months at a time (and sometimes decide not to come home); people who make these crazy life altering decisions and go through so much pain for the sake of upholding a benevolent idea. I've learned a little bit from every single one of you. And I need you to know something else: You've changed my life. Just watching you do what you do has given me so much excitement about the world. You taught me the value of college just a few years late.\n\nThere are some of you who might be wondering what the value of your education is. You still might be in school. You still might be trying to figure out what it is you're going to do with your life. I learned a lot about that these last four years. I noticed that everyone who was kicking ass had a few things in common and as I get ready to leave and attempt to spread the gospel of \"Be Awesome,\" I'd like to share what I saw in them as a doctrine for excellence.\n\nAnd so I give you the 10 commandments of Being Awesome:\n\n1. Be a dork.\n\nA person who confidently and assertively loves Dungeons & Dragons is always cooler (and somehow more attractive to the opposite sex) than a person who wears a snapback and gets hammered for the sake of trying to look cool. It's been amazing for me to realize that some of the most confident and respectable people are, in their heart of hearts, nerds that don't give a shit if you call them nerds. Pay close attention to the people who you admire for doing extraordinary things. They are only able to do those things by breaking the boundaries of what is deemed as \"normal.\"\n\n2. Say YES to new things.\n\nThis was my single biggest failing as an undergrad. I didn't join clubs because I didn't want to feel like the new kid/outsider. I didn't want to dance because I might look silly. I turned down hundreds of opportunities to do what was comfortable and ended up missing the boat entirely. If you're going to be excellent you have to know who you are and what you offer. If you want to know who you are and what you offer, you have to figure out what you like and don't like. If you want to find out what you like and don't like, you have to try EVERYTHING you get access to. That all starts by saying Yes. The most excellent people at any college are involved in a few things. They understand the opportunities they're missing if they just go to class and call that their education.\n\n3. Don't take criticism personally.\n\nEVERYONE who I saw accomplish something big these last four years was told in the beginning that what they wanted to do was not possible. In every situation I saw whoever was about to do something great say, \"fuck the haters. I'm doing it anyway\" and then proceed to create something unbelievable. When someone says something is impossible, they mean it's impossible for them. If you have a vision, break their rules. Break them often and don't feel guilty. Here's one of my favorite examples: SUNY OSWEGO RAIL JAM\n\n4. Embrace failure.\n\nFor every good idea there are 10 bad ones. The key is to let bad ideas go and focus on the positives you've built. It's cliche to say but failures aren't people who fail. Failures are people who fail and feel sorry for themselves instead of going back to the drawing board with the lessons they've learned"}

Presumably, one goes into them just to hang out and chat about buying a house in this gallery-type environment.\n\nNo one needs, I suppose, to see any images. House buying is an abstract concept for so many these days. I await the inevitable arrival of a butcher's that doesn't put its meat in the shop front.\n\nThe air of unreality about these hip house floggers is entirely fitting. House prices are unreal. Ridiculous. Every day there are stories about the insanity of our current housing crisis, but it goes on and on. We laugh at images of what are basically cupboards for sale or rent. We cry or sigh with identification at the tales of young folk who can never really leave home. Except that some are not so young. Fortysomethings are having to move back in with their parents after marital bust-ups or because they no longer manage their own housing costs, the so-called \"doomerang generation\".\n\nThe London skyscraper that is a stark symbol of the housing crisis Read more\n\nIt is taken for granted that the only people who can afford to buy their own homes in many parts of the country, not only in London, will do so because of inherited wealth. This is now the great divide and, as social housing is run down, it is unbridgeable. The very things that gave me social mobility \u2013 free education and social housing \u2013 are not there for my children. Bit by bit, every escape route has been shut down.\n\nSo often when I am talking to young people I realise that it is now utterly pointless to speak about what it was like for me. It is now a different world, and yet the fundamental myths, the founding stories, if you like, of what it is to be a grown up have not shifted. How can you be a grown up when you can never have your own home?\n\nHousing is so central as it remains the clear and present sign of inequality doled out in cubic metres. And housing is the intra-generational issue. You have to have way above average wealth to be help out your children property-wise and not to retire into poverty yourself at 66. The cultural accounts, though, of what the progression into adulthood consists of have not caught up with this new reality. Thus, \"leaving home\", finding the one job for life, the one partner for ever, getting married, having a baby, buying a home, these remain the sum of desires, however unrealistic they may be. For all these things are interconnected, and in an age of student debt, a labour market that is keeping wages low, insane rents and clear evidence that having a baby does not produce huge happiness, or even relationship glue for many couples, why are these things the measure of adult life?\n\nThere is often a sneery attitude to young people that describes them as being in a state of extended adolescence. These millennials, we are told, are mollycoddled, cannot cope with failure and are somehow not fit for purpose. But it is these generations who are at the sharp end of a system that is failing. Abstractly, we can see how capitalism is no longer working, even within its own terms \u2013 the Thomas Piketty analysis. The rich simply seek to protect their own wealth and the rest of us have to pay for public goods, from health to education. This huge inequality is resulting in a slowing down of innovation, poorer public services, worsening working conditions and huge rents. But how does that pan out over individual lives? We can see the result of this on younger folk who live with this insecurity.\n\nGeneration rent: only 26% of young adults will be on housing ladder by 2025 Read more\n\nWhat does it now mean to be an adult if the old markers of adulthood become out of reach? Levels of home ownership are in decline. We now have a fully fledged caste system delineated by property. This is happening in the US, too. Wages for under-30s are going down. International surveys indicate that what millennials crave is job security. Lack of security also means delaying that other marker of maturity \u2013 having a baby \u2013 often indefinitely. All over the world, women are choosing not to procreate. This is entirely understandable. Why would women have children when their jobs are not secure? Many younger women feel their choices have been absolutely narrowed. A global downturn has meant that many of the foundation stones that we used to mark adulthood have been dug up, so that everything feels a bit shaky.\n\nMeanwhile, the dominant narrative remains ever more shrill as it is unrealisable: work for ever, a partner for ever, a perfect"}

{"id": 1190, "ended": true, "length": 994, "text": "Last week on Book Riot, Jeff O'Neal laid out his theory about why books translate so readily into movie gold. It's a lovely, overgenerous idea.\n\nWhen was the last time a book resulted in a truly great piece of cinema? Still thinking? That's because on balance books make bad movies. Cinema's slavish addiction to books has produced more dross than dynamite. For every glorious artistic high (The Godfather), there's been scores of depressing downers (Love in The Time of Cholera, The Lovely Bones, The Scarlet Letter, Gulliver's Travels, The Time Machine, etc. ad infinitum). Yes they might make financially successful films (The Harry Potter and Twilight series), but dear God, they are overwhelmingly dull viewing (Yes, The Harry Potter and Twilight series \u2013 apart from the third part of each).\n\nJeff mentioned that the majority of the most anticipated films of next year, as listed by Entertainment Weekly, are adaptations of books. Great. Most will be so teeth-gnashingly awful they will make you question the morality of teaching kids to read.\n\nHere's the problem. By borrowing the story and affectations of a great book, the movie hopes to inherit some of that greatness. But cinema is a different storytelling beast. More often than not, a book's hand-me down trappings hang ill-fitting and constraining on the screen. Yes, people will flock to see it, but more often than not will leave awkwardly underwhelmed.\n\nThe best film of all time according to the AFI is Citizen Kane. The reason? It was a moment when cinema floated free of its literary hang-ups and developed a new, confident language all its own. My personal favourite film is a constantly rotating title shared between Raiders of the Lost Ark and Back To The Future. Both are pure, unalloyed cinema. The best film trilogy of all time is similarly free from literary connections: Toy Story. But these preferences are for another time, another blog.\n\nIt's not all bad news. The same AFI list is packed with films with their roots on the page. These are the glorious, transcendent exceptions to the rule. And this is because certain kinds of novels translate more readily into great cinema. So, for all the wannabe movie producers out there, don't despair, here are a few tips to guide you to your first Oscar:\n\nAdapt short stories\n\n\nOne page in a book equals one minute on screen. This is why watching a two hour film of a 400 page novel gives you indigestion. The plots are truncated; characters mere ellipses. Avoid heartburn (not to mention heartache) by adapting a short story or novella. It not only allows you to fit everything in, but allows the story to breathe, forget for a moment it is an adaptation and add some of its own, uniquely cinematic moments.\n\nExamples: Brokeback Mountain; The Shawshank Redemption; Don't Look Now; 2001: A Space Odyssey; The Diving Bell and The Butterfly\n\nAim low\n\nForget the classics section of your local book store. Instead, go to the airport. For here lies cinematic gold. The Godfather is not Great Literature. Neither are Robert Ludlum's Bourne thrillers. Both are hugely enjoyable reads, but at their heart they are glorious, pulpy airport novels. Which makes them perfect for the movies, a medium that makes a virtue of the surface. With The Godfather, it took cinema to make a popular, populist book into high art. Also, the more pulpy the material, the more likely film makers will be allowed to play fast and loose with the plot, usually to the film's benefit.\n\nExamples: The Maltese Falcon; The Godfather; Jaws; Blade Runner, The Bourne Identity/Supremacy/Ultimatum\n\nThink new and unknown\n\nThe most common pitfall of a film adaptation is to reverentially adapt it. And no other kinds of books demand this more than old or successful ones. Time and fame are tyrants that make their stories starchy and inflexible. Adaptations of classics are usually exercises in reanimating corpses. So, adapt newer or lesser known fare. Alfred Hitchcock knew this. He bought up the rights of the newly published thriller by Robert Bloch, Psycho. He then bought every copy he could find to keep the plot twists a secret. (He also followed the previous two points with many of his films: The Birds, Vertigo). Working with new and unknown books, without traction in the public consciousness, frees film makers to craft their own vision with the material before nervous movie execs clutching market-testing reports come knocking.\n\nExamples: Psycho, There Will Be Blood"}

But some adults also expressed interest, saying they may feel less nervous talking to robots than a real person,\" said Kim Mi-Young, an official at Daegu city education office.\n\nKim said some may be sent to remote rural areas of South Korea shunned by foreign English teachers.\n\nShe said the robots are still being tested. But officials might consider hiring them full time if scientists upgrade them and make them easier to handle and more affordable.\n\n\"Having robots in the classroom makes the students more active in participating, especially shy ones afraid of speaking out to human teachers,\" Kim said.\n\nShe stressed the experiment was not about replacing human teachers with robots. \"We are helping upgrade a key, strategic industry and all the while giving children more interest in what they learn.\"\n\nThe four-month pilot programme was sponsored by the government, which invested 1.58 billion won (1.37 million dollars).\n\nScientists have held pilot programmes in schools since 2009 to develop robots to teach English, maths, science and other subjects at different levels with a desired price tag of five to eight million won.\n\nSagong stressed that the robots, which currently cost 10 million won each, largely back up human teachers but would eventually have a bigger role.\n\nThe machines can be an efficient tool to hone language skills for many people who feel nervous about conversing with flesh-and-blood foreigners, he said.\n\n\"Plus, they won't complain about health insurance, sick leave and severance package, or leave in three months for a better-paying job in Japan... all you need is a repair and upgrade every once in a while.\"\n\nWalter DerzKO"}

Many arguments I saw were rather generic \u2014 grouping all third-party libraries into one basket. As with most things, though, it's not that simple. So, let's try to focus on a single case today: should we avoid using third-party UI libraries?\n\nReasons to consider third-party libraries\n\nThere seem to be two main reasons developers consider using a third party library:\n\nLack of skill or knowledge. Let's say, you're working on a photo sharing app. You don't start by rolling your own crypto. Lack of time or interest to build something. Unless you have an unlimited amount of time (which no human has yet) you have to prioritize.\n\nMost UI libraries (not all!) tend to fall into the second category. This stuff is no rocket science, but it takes time to build it right.\n\nWhat to \"outsource\"\n\nSo, how do we actually decide what code to write ourselves and what to delegate to a third-party component? The famous Joel's advice applies really well here:\n\nIf it's a core business function \u2014 do it yourself, no matter what.\n\nA (possibly hard) truth is that most iOS apps are skewed towards being frontend- rather than backend-heavy. The look matters. It follows that we should consider doing as much UI development as possible in-house. One could argue that it's just one person's opinion, so let's go through specific reasons you should rethink your usage of third-party UI libraries.\n\nProblems with UI libraries\n\nGeneric vs. specific\n\nThere are pretty much two types of controls/views:\n\nGeneric, allowing you to use them in many different contexts not even thought of by their creators, e.g. UICollectionView from UIKit. Specific, designed for a single use-case, e.g. UIPickerView .\n\nMost third-party libraries tend to fall into the second category. What's more, they're often extracted from an existing codebase for which they were optimized.\n\nAs an example, that cool-looking pull to refresh control you saw last month? Yeah, it probably won't fit your app's design or use cases, like view controller containment or contentInset value being modified.\n\nInheritance as a way to personalize\n\nAs far as OOP goes, there's an industry-wide move from subclassing to composition. Make sure you're not going against the flow when choosing a library. In most cases you let someone else do the composition for you, leaving you with only subclassing or direct code modification at your disposal.\n\n(Delegate pattern is one of the approaches to composition.)\n\nToo customized look\n\nThis may seem counterintuitive but the less visible UI there is in a library, the better. The problem with highly customized controls/views is that it's not possible to specify their requirements in a way that will fit all use cases.\n\nIf there's a lot of custom UI, you may not be able to contribute back to the upstream, because your ideas about the look or feel may be different than those of the maintainer. You'll have to either maintain a fork or use some ugly hacks on the app's side just to remove that one shadow.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum are libraries that operate on the UI level but don't provide any or almost any look by themselves, think SDWebImage or my SloppySwiper. These have a higher chance of not needing to be modified just to fit into your project.\n\nUnknown early assumptions\n\nMany teams do code reviews of their internal code but may be taking third-party source code's quality for granted. It's worth spending a bit of time just browsing a library's code. You may end up being surprised to see some red flags, e.g. swizzling used where it's not needed.\n\nTry to get a glimpse of the architecture. Will you be able to adjust the library to your future needs or will you have to rewrite it after your MVP ships?\n\nYou should assess the general health of the project too. How many commits, pull requests and issues have there been lately? Are there any unit or UI tests? Ignore the GitHub stars, though \u2013 they're mostly meaningless.\n\nIdea > code?\n\nI like open-source because it allows me to see how other people think and design their solutions. Often learning the idea is more beneficial than obtaining the resulting code itself. If a library touches UI and is small, it's often better to get inspired by its code and develop a component yourself to suit your needs perfectly.\n\nCan't hide it\n\nBecause of the way UIKit is designed you most probably won't be able to"}

Given that most of my current gaming group was formed around the Edge of the Empire RPG, Imperial Assault is a perfect fit for us.\n\nOne of the guys in our group got his hands on a copy a little over a week ago, and we've only played through the introduction, but we're already hooked. However, having played as the Evil Overlord\u2122 for Descent and now taking up the mantle of Imperial Overlord/Player for Imperial Assault, I noticed what seems a large problem with the contents of the box. While Fantasy Flight is kind enough to provide a \"campaign log\" for the game, it doesn't track much of what the players need to remember between sessions, particularly if, like me, you expect to have two or more campaigns going on simultaneously.\n\nFor instance, the campaign log doesn't list what skills or items have been bought, what side missions or story missions are active, how the Imperial Player has been spending his influence, etc. All of these are things that are critical to maintain from session to session. For Descent, I was referred by a friend to a campaign log pdf that tracked all of the relevant information for the party and I decided that Imperial Assault really needed the same thing. So I made this. NOTE: The document may contain minor spoilers if you are playing as a Rebel Hero and not as the Imperial Player.\n\nAs part of the document, I included a chart of all of the story missions for the core-game's campaign. I'm sure that FFG or other players will come up with new campaigns over time, so I expect I'll have to update the document as that happens. Along with listing which missions are currently \"active\" based on previous results and the decisions of the players in the case of side missions, I also listed the rewards for each mission so that the players can easily review how much XP and how many credits they should have earned over time. The only down-side to the mission tracking part of the document is that the side-mission deck is supposed to include four missions that are random and not shown to any player, including the Imperial player (Rules Reference Guide, pg. 17). In my opinion, however, it makes little-to-no difference if the Imperial Player knows the contents of the side-mission deck, so long as it's properly randomized, as he'll be just as aware as the players once the cards are dealt.\n\nThe second page of the document lists the skills for each hero and imperial class, along with a space to show the XP earned by each side. It also includes a small chart to mark which rewards have been earned by either side based on mission results.\n\nFinally, the last page lists all of the items available at each tier, along with their prices, whether they've been purchased or sold, and their resale price, should the players choose to sell them. I also included a small chart for the credit totals as I know, in Descent, tracking the players money can sometimes be difficult to double-check without proper bookkeeping. Finally, I included an area for the Imperial Player to track his (or her) Agenda deck. This includes tracking their Influence total, how much they've spent of the total, which agenda sets they're using, whether cards are in their hand, actively on the table, or discarded entirely from the deck. This last bit, in particular, is something that I feel might cause problems, should the heroes go peeking at the log, however if the Imperial player is managing the document, I don't expect there will be any issues.\n\nAnyway\u2026 all of that to say, here's a document that I hope others find as useful as I've crafted it to be. I'd be happy to hear any suggestions for additions or changes. Until next time: Stop assaulting the Empire! They're the rightful government, you know!"}

REUTERS/Zohra Bensemra/File Photo\n\nIslamic State documents and posters, obtained in villages captured by Iraqi forces, highlight a tight and comprehensive system of rule by the militants, who went to great lengths to explain their extremist philosophy.\n\nThe documents and other materials, printed with Islamic State logos, were found by Reuters in offices used by the group until a few days ago. Members of the Iraqi forces told Reuters the documents originated from Islamic State, although this could not be independently verified.\n\nIraqi security forces and Kurdish peshmerga fighters have seized several villages and towns during an offensive against the northern city of Mosul, Islamic State's last stronghold in the country.\n\nWhen Islamic State swept through the north in 2014, it announced a self-proclaimed caliphate, which appealed to some fellow Sunnis who felt marginalized by the Shi'ite-led central government.\n\nBut that appeal faded as Islamic State enforced its medieval thinking with brute force, beheading anyone deemed an opponent.\n\nSlick, colorful posters, pamphlets and documents highlight Islamic State's intense focus on dictating what it called proper Islamic behavior for the citizens of its caliphate.\n\nViolations of its rules meant punishment such as public whipping or being hauled off to Mosul for execution, according to several villagers who recently escaped from Islamic State areas.\n\nA green wallet-size insert lays out guidelines for how to pray properly. It shows a young boy undertaking ablutions. \"Wash your feet from the direction of your toes down to your heels,\" it said.\n\nGOLD BRACELETS\n\nA five-page pamphlet with pictures of gold bracelets, diamond rings and wheat on the front spelled out instructions on how to give alms, an obligation under Islam. Failure to do so would mean a penalty.\n\nIn the village of Shura, where seven Islamic State suicide bombers were recently shot dead as they rushed toward Iraqi forces, militants kept meticulous records of who had given alms. Entries showed whether an individual owned gold, property or a car. Monthly salaries were also noted.\n\nUnlike al Qaeda, its predecessor in Iraq, Islamic State made its name in the jihadi world by becoming the first militant group to capture significant amounts of land in the Middle East, hold it and then set up an administration.\n\nBut air strikes by a U.S.-led coalition targeting Islamic State's leaders and its sources of income have dealt a major blow to the caliphate.\n\nIslamic State's inclination to codify its system of rule extended to what it called the spoils of war.\n\nA pink and red pamphlet includes 32 questions and answers on how to deal with female captives.\n\nA senior Islamic State cleric has the authority to distribute female captives among its fighters, it said.\n\n\"Non-Muslim women can be taken as concubines,\" according to the leaflet.\n\nMilitants can own two sisters as concubines but only have sex with one.\n\n\"Pre-pubescent girls can be taken as concubines. You cannot have penetrative sex but you can still enjoy them,\" the leaflet added.\n\nOne question in the pamphlet asks whether a group of militants can share a concubine. The answer: only a single owner can sleep with a concubine.\n\nAfter blazing through northern Iraq, Islamic State took hundreds of women from the Yazidi minority as sex slaves.\n\nUnder Islamic State's rules, women were required to largely stay at home or wear head-to-toe black coverings if they ventured out. Men wore short pants which were deemed Islamic along with beards of appropriate length.\n\nOne of the pamphlets begins by defining a beard as \"hair that grows on your face and your cheeks\".\n\nThere were few forms of entertainment under Islamic State, which banned the internet and music along with cell phones.\n\nA ban on satellite dishes deprived Iraqis of news of the outside world. In a huge slick poster, entitled \"Why I Should Destroy My Dish\", the jihadists provided 20 reasons, revolving mostly around the immorality of satellite television programs.\n\nReason 8: \"Because satellite channels show stories of love and naked women and inappropriate language.\"\n\nReason 10: \"Because satellite channels normalize men being effeminate and sissies.\""}

Evangelicals can morally justify a protest vote for a third party, not vote at all, or join the 30%+ of evangelicals saying they'll vote for Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhat we cannot do is to cast our vote for Donald Trump. The harm to the Christian witness if we support this man who embodies everything Christ warned Christians against in the Sermon on the Mount would last generations.\n\nWhat will our Latino brothers and sisters think of us? How could we ever again have credibility on religious freedom if we are willing to trade the First Amendment rights of our Muslim American neighbors so easily? And what will our children learn when they see us cast our lot with this man?\n\nWe cannot be deceived about the man we'd be voting to make the most powerful man in the world.\n\nTrump has said he will order U.S. soldiers to kill innocent women and children of our enemies and do \"the unthinkable\" when it comes to torture\u2014all in violation of international law and Christian morality.\n\nTrump said he has never asked God for forgiveness and does not need to.\n\nTrump is a thrice-married adulterer who brags not only about cheating on his own wife but with the wives of other men. In the words of GOP Rep. Reid Ribble, \"Trump is often simply hateful,\" having mocked the disabled and saying things about women CP won't even let me print. Remember, this is the man who says he's never needed God's forgiveness.\n\nI know the editors of CP to be good evangelical Christians, but they made the same mistake many evangelicals are liable to make. They said they were actually tempted by Trump's offer to \"Vote for me, and I will give you Supreme Court picks and abolish the Johnson Amendment.\"\n\nTrump's \"tempting\" offer is remarkably like another made two millennia ago \u2026 when the Devil offered Jesus the power to rule over all the kingdoms of the world with justice and mercy, if only Christ would bow down to the Devil. American Christians should not take a deal Jesus rejected.\n\nIt profits a man nothing to give his soul in exchange for the entire world ... how can we possibly consider doing so in exchange for Trump's empty promise of Supreme Court nominees?\n\nIt can't be because of abortion. When George W. Bush was President, 2/3 of the Supreme Court were Republican appointees, and Republicans controlled the White House and all of Congress. Yet Roe remains. We cannot possibly be so na\u00efve as to believe Donald Trump \u2014 who until he decided to run as a Republican supported partial birth abortion without restriction \u2014 would do more.\n\nI sure hope it's not because of \"religious freedom\" or the fear I've heard that if we get a liberal Court, Christianity will decline in America. I absolutely reject the fear that underlies the Supreme Court idolatry taking hold in some of our churches. If the Church needs the Court to save souls and empower a faithful witness \u2014 both spoken and lived \u2014 then we are truly lost. Christ promised us a cross and the Holy Spirit as our advocate, not tax breaks for our business and a worldly Court to defend our beliefs.\n\nIt would be the extreme of folly to place our hope of religious freedom in a man who says he'll use the government to spy on houses of worship, deny sanctuary to families fleeing ISIS and disqualify judges based on their faith, and who the Christian Post editors said would silence Christian leaders who oppose him like Russell Moore and Max Lucado. What would it say about us to accept this deal of Trump's on the condition that we turn a blind eye to his taking religious freedom from others and persecuting some of our most faithful Christian leaders?\n\nAnd where did this anti-Johnson Amendment stuff come from? In what world do we think it's a good idea to allow our tithes to be used to support political candidates and for churches to become openly partisan political operations? Is there a faster way to turn God's house from a house of prayer into a den of thieves?!\n\nTo the faithful, Trump has said, \"Christians should vote for me because if I'm there, you're going to have plenty of power. You don't need anybody else.\" Trump claims to be sinless and without need of God's forgiveness. Let me ask you, when the beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies, what kind of things do you think he said?\n\nWhat will it do to the evangelical witness if we are marked by our support of Trump? And given Trump's life of broken promises"}

The snow crunched under my feet as I walked with the Chechen rebel commander away from the warmth of our safe house. When we entered a bombed-out neighborhood 15 minutes away, I put the battery in my Iridium satellite phone and waited for the glowing screen to signal that I had locked on to the satellites.\n\nI made my call. It was short. Then the commander made a call; he quickly hung up and handed me back the phone. \"Enough,\" he said, motioning for me to remove the battery.\n\nAs we walked briskly back to the safe house, it was exactly 10 minutes before the cascade of double wa-whumps announced the Grad rocket batteries pounding the vacant neighborhood we had just left.\n\nIt was December 1999, and the Russian assault on Grozny was unfolding in all its gruesome detail. After the dissolution of so much of the former Soviet empire, Chechnya was one country that the newly minted prime minister, Vladimir Putin, refused to let go of. His boss, Boris Yeltsin, and the Russian army had been defeated and then humiliated in the media by Chechen forces in the first war. Five years later, Russia was back. And Putin's new strategy was unbending: silence, encircle, pulverize, and \"cleanse.\" It was a combination of brutal tactics \u2014 a Stalinist purge of fighting-age males plus Orwellian propaganda that fed Russians a narrative wherein Chechen freedom fighters were transformed into Islamist mercenaries and terrorists. More than 200,000 civilians were to die in this war, the echoes of which continue to this day.\n\nThis time, journalists were specifically targeted to prevent sympathetic or embarrassing reports from escaping the killing zone. As such, you can't find a lot of stories about the second Chechen war. One of the few and best accounts was written by Marie Colvin, who described her terrifying escape from Grozny for the Sunday Times. Last month, Colvin thought she could roll the dice and enter the besieged Syrian city of Homs to defy yet another brutal war of oppression. This time she lost.\n\nIt's impossible to know whether Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \u2014 a longtime ally of Russia \u2014 studied the success of the last Chechen war before launching his own assault on the restive city of Homs. However, his Russian military advisors surely know the tactics well. The crackdown in Homs carries a grim echo of Grozny, both in its use of signals intelligence to track down and silence the regime's enemies and in its bloody determination to obliterate any opposition, including Western journalists.\n\nAssad's ability to lethally target journalists using satellite-phone uplinks could well have cost Colvin her life. Multiple reports have suggested that Syrian forces used phone signals to pinpoint her location and then launched a rocket barrage that resulted in her death on Feb. 22, along with that of French photographer Remi Ochlik and multiple Syrian civilians.\n\nThe use of satellite and cellular transmissions to determine a subject's location was relatively new a decade ago, when I was in Grozny. Tracking phone transmissions to hunt down targets began in earnest with a covert unit of U.S. intelligence officers from the National Security Agency (NSA), CIA, Navy, Air Force, and special operations called \"The Activity.\" This snooping unit was also called the Army of Northern Virginia, Grey Fox, and even Task Force Orange. We see much of this technology used to inform modern drone and U.S. Joint Special Operations Command strikes. My decade covering U.S. spec ops, intelligence gathering, and their contractors highlighted the impressive ability of various countries to monitor, locate, network, and act on what is called SIGINT, or signals intelligence.\n\nThe Russians have their own version of this capability, which fell under the command of the Federal Agency of Government Communications and Information, now part of the Federal Protective Service. In the United States, it would be equivalent to the NSA and FBI combined, and the agency provides sophisticated eavesdropping support to Russia's military, intelligence, and counterterrorism units \u2014 and to Russia's allies, including Syria.\n\nRussia has spent a long time perfecting these techniques. On April 21, 1996, Chechnya's breakaway president, Dzhokhar Dudayev, was speaking on a satellite phone with Russian envoy Konstantin Borovoi about setting peace talks with Yeltsin. During the phone call, he was killed by a signal-guided missile fired from a Russian jet fighter. The warplane had received Dudayev's coordinates from a Russian ELINT (electronic intelligence) plane that had picked up and locked on to the signal emitted by the satellite phone. It was Russian deception and brutality at its finest.\n\nIt should have been clear even back then that there was a benefit and a distinct penalty to modern communications on the battlefield.\n\nFlash forward to"}

Konami has added some graphics options to this new version and according to JP Kellams, Creative Producer at PlatinumGames, the game won't support resolutions higher than 1080p. In short, you're screwed if you own a 1440p monitor.\n\nAs JP Kellams unveiled, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance offers support for resolutions up to 1080p, up to 8x MSAA, up to 16x Aniostropic Filtering and gives the ability to turn on or off Blur. In addition, players can set the Shadow Zangeki quality to Low, Mid and High.\n\nBut exactly does Zangeki do? Here is what JP Kellams said about that particular setting:\n\n\"High Zangeki mode is twice as many cut objects as consoles (400/enemies and 400/objects) and they remain on-screen for twice as long (30s).\"\n\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance does not certainly sound as bad \u2013 as a port \u2013 as Dark Souls, though a lot of PC gamers will curse Konami for locking the resolution to 1080p. Which brings the question \u2013 why lock the resolution and not let us use even 4K resolutions?\n\nFOV will also remain the same with the console version (thanks for the heads up Nersdarsm).\n\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance is scheduled for a January 9th release on the PC.\n\nEnjoy the first PC screenshots!"}

Please note, the PDF may not reflect all the changes and updates on this webpage.\n\n\nQ: How do I register?\n\nA: You can register at www.faa.gov/uas/registration/. If you need assistance, please call 877 396 4636.\n\nQ: Do I have to register every aircraft?\n\nA: No, you only need to register your name, physical address, and email address.\n\nQ: Do I need to list both my AMA number and my federal registration number on my aircraft?\n\nA: Yes, you need to list both your AMA number and Federal registration number on your aircraft. We are advocating to allow members to use their AMA numbers. We believe an AMA membership already meets the intent of registration, but at this time place both numbers on your aircraft.\n\nQ: How does UAS registration affect my membership?\n\nA: AMA club or member benefits are not contingent on UAS registration. We encourage all members to follow Federal regulations, but we are not policing UAS registration.\n\nQ: Is my club expected to police UAS registration?\n\nA: We do not expect clubs to police UAS registration, that decision is left to each individual club and the clubs leadership.\n\nQ: Am I required by law to comply with the guidelines listed on the UAS Registration site?\n\nA: The FAA acknowledged that AMA members should continue to follow AMA's community-based safety code. We also discussed and the FAA confirmed that the language on the FAA registration site is a guideline, not regulation. This guideline is not directed at the AMA community but rather, it is a simplified set of safety guidelines geared to the general public.\n\nQ: Why did AMA change its position on registration? Why are they telling members to register now?\n\nA: AMA has not changed its position. We continue to be disappointed with the registration rule and believe it is contrary to Congress's intent within the Special Rule for Model Aircraft, which is part of the 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act. We have been working with our legal counsel and the FAA to find a solution for our members on the registration rule. To date, the FAA has agreed in principle to several items that will help ease this process for our members.\n\nHowever, we want to emphasize that this is not the end of our efforts to protect AMA members from this overreaching regulation. We are continuing to explore all legal and political options available, but these conversations may take time and a definitive solution is unlikely before the February 19 registration deadline. For this reason, we are suggesting that AMA members may wish to take advantage of free registration period, which is available until January 21.\n\nQ: Is the AMA giving up? Why doesn't the AMA take this matter to court?\n\nA: AMA is by no means giving up. We are resolute in our commitment and will continue to advocate on behalf of our members.. We are continuing to fight for the aeromodelling community and working to protect modelers from unnecessary and burdensome regulation. AMA is exploring several legal options that would address the registration rule as well. These legal strategies will take time to develop and pursue. We ask for your continued loyalty and patience as we work closely with our legal counsel to find the best path forward.\n\nQ: I am already registered through the AMA, why do I have to register twice?\n\nA: We understand the concern of our members and, while the FAA is open to streamlining the registration for our members, unfortunately the technical issues involved will not be resolved before February 19. Therefore, it will be necessary for current AMA members to register separately with the FAA. For future AMA members, we are working on an agreement with the FAA where for new members federal registration will automatically be fulfilled when they join the AMA, thereby creating one simple registration.\n\nQ: Am I permitted to fly above 400 feet? What if I had to check a box saying otherwise on the federal registration website?\n\nA: Yes. AMA members who abide by the AMA Safety Code, which permits flights above 400 feet under appropriate circumstances, and are protected by the Special Rule for Model Aircraft under the 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act. Checking the box on the federal registration webpage signifies an understanding of the 400 foot guideline. This is an important safety principle that all UAS operators need to be aware of, and is the same guideline established in AC 91-57 published in 1981. However, the placement of this guideline on the FAA website is intended as an educational piece and more specifically intended for those operating outside of AMA's safey program. We have been in discussions with the FAA about this point and the agency has indicted that it will be updating its website in the next week to make clear that this altitude guideline is not intended to supplant the guidance and safety procedures established in AMA"}

{"id": 1211, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "The Golden Sun 4-Koma Gag Battle is a self-published Japanese manga (doujinshi) released on December 10, 2001 in Japan as part of the Hi no Tama Game Comic Series, published by Kobunsha. It is an unofficial work that is not formally endorsed by Camelot Software Planning but is published and sold for profit by the manga artists nonetheless; while from a Western standpoint this would be illegal, from the Japanese standpoint the doujinshi industry in general is widespread and generally accepted, and any legal action by companies whose characters and fictional properties are being used without their formal permission is uncommon. It was published four months after Golden Sun's August 1, 2001 Japanese release date. Since Golden Sun: The Lost Age was released 10 months after the first game, the 4-Koma only features characters and references from the first game, and thus Piers, Karst and Agatio are noticeably absent.\n\nThe volume is composed of four-cell strips done by various artists. 4-Koma is shorthand for Yonkoma Manga, meaning 4-cell manga. The majority of the strips involve humour, hence Gag Battle. Eighteen artists contributed to the manga. Each one of them contributed one colour page and six black-and-white pages. In total, the manga came up to 126 pages, 16 of them colored.\n\nThere have been separate translation projects underway to translate it into English for the Western Golden Sun community. One project has been ongoing at Golden Sun Realm, with the scans being withheld until it is completed. The other project is being done by a community member pen-named Sora G. Silverwind, who releases the individual scans once translated.\n\nThe following table describes each individual page/strip in detail. It is based off the English fan translations and scans provided by Silverwind, and thus is only as complete as her scanslations.\n\nThis first group of pages of the manga are in color, unlike the rest of the product.\n\nTranslated title Artist Synopsis\n\nUsing Psynergy Tonami Minato Isaac and Garet see a nearby chest, but across a canyon. Isaac figures that if his Move Psynergy can work on rocks and the like, he should be able to use it to telekinetically transport Garet across the canyon to the chest. This does not go so well, as Isaac runs out of power and Garet is dropped right into the canyon.\n\nUsing Psynergy, Take Two Tonami Minato With Isaac and Garet now at the bottom of the canyon pit, Isaac figures this time to use the Lift Psynergy to transport Garet up out of the canyon and onto where the chest is. The two hands associated with the Lift Psynergy grab Garet, but Isaac later admits it is difficult to control the strength of the Psynergy, as Garet is flattened like a vertical pancake.\n\nLook At This Chigusa Hiroko Isaac and company relax in an oasis in Lamakan Desert that they discovered with Reveal. They ponder how ordinarily, this oasis is \"unseen\", while someone or something a fair distance away notices them and is perturbed by the sight of people bathing in a pit of sand.\n\nGo Ahead, Look! Chigusa Hiroko Mia acquires a Mercury Djinni, and Isaac and Ivan note how the watery effects seen when a Mercury Djinni joins the party makes befriending a Mercury Djinni look so refreshing for the person getting it. Likewise, when Garet gets a Mars Djinni, Isaac and Ivan note how painful it looks to befriend a Djinni of that element.\n\nGolden Gratification Hakyuu Shou Isaac engages in an internal monologue on the elements of the world and how he is holding the embodiment of Mars, the Mars Star, in the palm of his hand, leading him to the deep realization... that with an object that valuable, there is nothing he can't buy. Garet is not amused.\n\nInstant Gratification Hakyuu Shou Isaac, Garet, and Ivan have just finished battling the gang of thieves in the inn at Vault. The man they rescued goes off to get the mayor, but Isaac eyes the nearby treasure chests the thieves previously accumulated and declares they gotta loot the chests for themselves now before it's too late. Garet and Ivan are baffled.\n\nContainer Sakura Shinobu Isaac & Co. are at the base of Mercury Lighthouse at the fountain newly filled with Hermes' Water. Mia realizes that they forgot to bring an empty bottle, but before she can go back to Imil for it, Isaac decides to fill his own mouth with the water and carry it like that - his idea of a makeshift \"container\". Mia is not amused.\n\nCrisis Sakura Shinobu Isaac and Garet are approached by Jenna, who rants that she's the main character here and feels she's being shoved out of the spotlight.\n\nUnderthings Ookubo Mid"}

Keith Sweeney fired his weapon multiple times at Pigeon, killing him.\n\nOfficer Nitzky, who has served on the police force for two years, and Sgt. Sweeney, who has served on the force for nine years, were placed on routine administrative leave.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Oklahoma County District Attorney's Office announced that a second-degree murder charge, or in the alternative, first-degree manslaughter, had been filed against Sgt. Sweeney.\n\n\"The act of shooting Dustin Pigeon was unreasonable, unjustified, and perpetrated in an imminently dangerous manner, evincing a depraved mind, and demonstrating a disregard for human life...\" the charge states.\n\nCourt documents state that the investigation into the incident concluded Pigeon was not armed and not a threat to the officers when he was shot by Sweeney.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater released body camera footage of the confrontation and shooting.\n\nThe footage shows three officers arriving at the scene and rushing toward Pigeon. The officers tell Pigeon to drop the lighter fluid and put his hands in the air.\n\nAt that point, Pigeon is seen putting his hands above his head and backing away from the officers. However, he did not drop the lighter fluid.\n\nPrater says that Sgt. Sweeney can be heard on the video saying, \"I will f******* shoot you\" to Pigeon.\n\nThe body camera footage shows Pigeon falling to the ground after being shot by Sgt. Sweeney.\n\nIn an interview with officials, Prater says that Sweeney told investigators that he thought Sweeney had a knife in his hand and felt like his life was in danger. He also added that he didn't hear the bean bag gun being fired.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Fraternal Order of Police released the following statement after charges were filed against Sweeney.\n\n\"Police officers are routinely placed in dangerous situations where they must quickly make life-or-death decisions. We caution citizens against jumping to conclusions until the facts are fully presented. At this time, the FOP is not privy to the findings of the criminal investigation, and the video released today is only one piece of the puzzle. We hope to have more information about the particulars of this tragic situation soon. The FOP will always support members who act in good faith under the policies of the Oklahoma City Police Department and the law. We know these are trying times for Sgt.Sweeney and his family, and we're here for them. We also offer our sympathy to Mr. Pigeon's family and loved ones,\" said John George, the president of the Oklahoma City FOP."}

He is Canadian, and he is playing for Spartak Moscow only because he is an NHL refugee hoping the long road leads back home.\n\nView photos\n\nSo when he walked out of the rink about three weeks ago after a 4-1 victory over Dinamo Minsk, he had no idea what the opposing fans were shouting or what they were shouting about. All he knew is they seemed angry \u2013 and guards were coming out with machine guns.\n\n\"Just to, like, basically keep the peace,\" Morrisonn said. \"It was pretty wild.\"\n\nIt wasn't until the next morning, when Morrisonn returned to the rink, that he found out what happened. The Minsk fans were making a scene simply because they were so livid about the loss. They were calling for the general manager's head.\n\nMaybe a few months ago, an incident like that would have confirmed Morrisonn's worst fears about playing here. More than anything, he was worried about his safety. But now that he has spent some time as a stranger in a strange land, he isn't scared at all.\n\nHe takes the Metro to the rink because Moscow traffic is a nightmare, cramming in with the old ladies and their babushkas and the yuppies and their iPhones. He takes the Metro home from the rink, too, even after games, and walks home alone in the dark.\n\n\"It's fine. It's safe,\" Morrisonn said. \"You hear the horror stories, but so far, it's been a great experience for me.\"\n\n[Nick Cotsonika: Evgeni Malkin embracing 'special' chance to star for hometown team]\n\nThere are North Americans like Morrisonn on teams all over the Kontinental Hockey League, which allows six imports per roster and five per lineup.

{"id": 1215, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Work-life balance sounds great, but it's getting tougher to achieve. Managers and staff often don't see eye to eye on time spent between the two. Several studies also indicate that the traditional workweek is getting longer. In certain industries such as accounting, law, consulting, or at startups in general, that balance is assumed to be impossible. The \"80-hour workweeks\" people complain about mean there's no time for everything else.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nYet after studying time logs kept by people in many of these industries, I've noticed something. Weeks described as epic often feature work-hour totals in the mid- to high 60s. More normal weeks often feature work-hour totals in the mid-50s to the lower 60s. Even though workers perceive that they're logging insane hours, one 2011 study comparing estimated workweeks with time diaries found people claiming 75-plus-hour weeks were off by about 25 hours. This 56-56-56 split is balance in its own way\u2013and is more achievable than any other version. In other words, working 56 hours a week, averaged over the long term, is a reasonable goal in many demanding jobs. This is an important number, because there are 168 hours in a week. If you work 56 hours, and sleep 56 hours (8 per night) that leaves 56 hours for other things. This 56-56-56 split is balance in its own way\u2013and is more achievable than any other version. With that in mind, there are several ways to have work hours in the long-but-reasonable category, yet make the most of the rest of your time. 1. Know Where The Time Goes Even if you track your work hours to bill clients, learning where your other 56 hours go can be eye opening. \"It's amazing how much you learn about the way you spend your time when you actually track it,\" says Paula Pant, who runs the Afford Anything blog and podcast. She had already cut the obvious time wasters (e.g., TV) out of her life, but when she tracked her time, she realized she spent 17.75 hours on things she didn't care about. Now, when she needs a break during work, she realizes, \"I could either click on BuzzFeed articles, or get up and do a quick 10-15 minutes of yoga.\" One gives her more energy, and feels like a better use of precious nonwork time. Look at your calendar for the next week on Friday, and see what can be canceled, shortened, or delegated. Work time itself can also be made more efficient. A survey by Post-It Brand found that on average, office workers say they attend three unnecessary meetings a week, and 24% say they attend five or more. Look at your calendar for the next week on Friday, and see what can be canceled, shortened, or delegated.\n\nadvertisement\n\n2. Think 168 Hours, Not 24 Vanessa Chan, the founder and chief designer at re.design studios and the inventor of loopit headphones, spent many years at the consulting firm McKinsey, becoming a partner before she left. She also has two daughters. \"Usually I think in one-week chunks,\" she says. During her consulting career, she would figure out her priorities for the week, and then map these out for individual days. She'd ask, \"How do I make sure I'm taking care of those? What am I putting off and when can I do that?\" By looking at a whole week, she could see that long work hours and travel Monday through Wednesday might be balanced by much shorter days, and visits to her daughters' school, later in the week. 3. Manage Others' Expectations Having a personal life in client-facing industries will always be challenging but not impossible. First, know that flexibility is a team sport. Clients can learn that someone will be available 24/7, but people will cover that availability in shifts. Intense jobs will take any time you give them, so you have to consciously speak up to demand time back for anything else that is important to you. Second, the good news is that in order to have a client call at 10 p.m. on Friday, the client has to want to be on the phone at 10 p.m. Friday, and this is not always the case. Anne Donovan, the People Innovation Leader at accounting firm PwC, has been at the firm for 33 years. Increasingly, she says, clients are facing their own staff demands for flexibility. Consequently, \"It's easier to be honest with our clients\" about personal needs. \"Five years ago we wouldn't bring that up to a client,\" she says, but now, more often than not, \"as long as we deliver, they don't care.\" 4. Make Work Fun The best way to keep your 56 working hours from feeling like 80 is to seek out projects you enjoy. Invest in your relationships with colleagues. \"Your personal life is very"}

It was Seddique Mateen, the father of Orlando mass shooter Omar Mateen.\n\nNewsChannel 5 asked Mateen what he was thinking about when Clinton spoke about the Orlando incident. \"We've been cooperating with the federal government, and that's about it,\" he said. \"Thank you.\"\n\nMateen didn't want to answer any other questions, but just hours later, WPTV ran into him by chance at a rest stop on the way back to West Palm Beach. He wanted to do an interview...\n\n...and show us a sign he made for Clinton.\n\nFinally when asked if he thought some people would be surprised to see him there, especially given the proximity to Orlando.\n\n\"Why should they be surprised? I love the United States, and I've been living here a long time,\" Mateen said.\n\nOf course, the fact that the mass-shooter's father was so perfectly placed seated right behind her is probably just a coincidence... but The Clinton campaign was very quick to deny it once social media noticed...\n\n\"The rally was a 3,000-person, open-door event for the public. This individual wasn't invited as a guest and the campaign was unaware of his attendance until after the event.\"\n\nStill, we are sure if Matteen's appearance had been embraced by the nation's liberals (for being brave enough to appear and support real change in America or something like that) then the campaign spin may have been different.\n\nOne final piece of food for thought...\n\nImagine Osama Bin Laden's father seated directly behind Bush at a rally right after 9/11 in NYC.

{"id": 1218, "ended": true, "length": 1019, "text": "On Friday's PBS NewsHour, anchor Judy Woodruff thought the police shootings were the top news story of the week, but she wasn't pleased when both liberal Mark Shields and pseudo-conservative David Brooks reluctantly agreed that looting and disorder were going to help Donald Trump politically.\n\nLooting? Woodruff hadn't really wanted to get that specific. She suggested that wasn't typical of Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And, David, Hillary Clinton put out a statement. I guess she tweeted that the video should be made public. She's going to Charlotte this weekend. What do we know about these candidates at a moment? This comes in the middle of the election. We're just a couple of days away from the debate. She's made some sympathetic comments. Donald Trump initially made a sympathetic comment about the victim in Tulsa, but then, I guess, last night made a speech and talked about we need to support the police. DAVID BROOKS: Right. Yes. So, just politically \u2014 and this is not what I support, but what I think realistically is the effect of this. I think it helps Donald Trump. I go back to 1968. Richard Nixon was helped by riots, if you want to put it that way. And Trump's campaign, from the convention speech on, has been really predicated on the argument that Americans are under violent threat, and that there is chaos and that our social order is being undone. And if there's not just the shootings, but the riots and the unrest, I think, at least for a certain segment of the population, that will undergird and support his argument, his perceptions of what America is. And I do think, if there's any political effect of this, that air of disorder will end up helping him a little. JUDY WOODRUFF: You agree it helps him? MARK SHIELDS: I think it's a pretty established principle in American politics that looting during a campaign helps the self-identified law and order candidate. JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, not all the protests involve looting. MARK SHIELDS: No. No \u2014 but when there is looting, is my point.\n\nAt the beginning of the PBS segment, viewers were only hearing about the horror of racially motivated police shootings, that they \"keep happening.\" There was no suggestion that protesters respond badly \u2013 or that looters are actually harming the credibility of protesters.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, we turn to the lead story tonight and for the last few nights, David, two more shootings in Tulsa and Charlotte, North Carolina, by police of black men. We're still getting the information. We know the Tulsa policewoman was charged with manslaughter. What are we to make of this, the fact that these keep happening? DAVID BROOKS: Well, first of all, the videos are just harrowing and have an effect on, I think, all of us and an effect on the national mood. It's just this is a man losing his life. This is a wife losing her husband. These are cops in the middle. And you can feel the pressure building on them as they don't know \u2014 quite know what to do. Beyond that, we don't really know that much.\n\nBrooks showed great sensitivity to the fear that police officers feel on the job, and talked about his discussions with them, so that offered a balance that you don't often hear in these \"Week in Review\" segments, where they usually agree Trump and Ted Cruz and other Republicans are horrible people.\n\nAfter disappointing Woodruff on the looting question, Shields did launch into a liberal lecture about how the poor city of Charlotte (and North Carolina in general) looks so terribly conservative now, and lost its \"too busy to hate\" label:\n\nSHIELDS: I think that North Carolina is a test case in many respects. North Carolina had the reputation among Southern states for being so progressive under the governorships of \u2014 particularly of Terry Sanford and Jim Hunt, exceptional national \u2014 state leaders and national leaders. And now, since \u2014 in the last year, since the legislature and its bathroom laws and other effects, it's seen its own reputation tarnished. It's lost the National Basketball Association all-star game, a matter of pride in a basketball state, lost the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament, which is an identifying icon of North Carolina life. WOODRUFF: Then some voting rights controversies. SHIELDS: It's lost \u2014 the voting rights controversy. It's lost jobs and business expansion. But I think this \u2014 Charlotte had the self-identified reputation of being the Atlanta, the new Atlanta, too busy to hate, and all the rest of it. And I think this is a blow. And I don't know how it plays out politically in the national election.\n\nSo he was trying to walk back the idea that looting in Charlotte would help Trump."}

In June VMware made sweeping updates to the intelligence side of the house, by adding or enhancing vSAN support for vRealize Automation, vRealize Operations and vRealize Log Insight. vRealize Operations 6.6 now pulls together all management functions in one integrated platform. In this review we take a look at the new enhancements through the lens of vSAN, highlighting the new and updated features across the vROps spectrum that VMware identifies as; Ensure Readyness, Operationalize vSAN and Optimize and Scale vSAN.\n\nNew Features in vROps 6.6 for vSAN\n\nWhen launching vROps 6.6, the most obvious change is the new HTML5 interface that looks in tune with the latest versions of the vCenter UI. The main screen is the vSAN Operations Overview. Along the top of the screen is general information for the entire vSAN environment including clusters, hosts, cache and capacity disks, VMs on the clusters, and performance information. Below this admins can select a specific cluster and immediately see information pertaining to that cluster including a summary, storage, component limits, cluster compute, average disk latency, IOPS, and throughput. The bottom left hand corner keeps track of events and alerts giving admins historical data to use to better plan out capacity usage in the future.\n\n\nRight-click and open in new tab for a larger image\n\nThe vSAN Capacity Dashboard gives admins a quick view of just about anything they need. They can see the overall vSAN capacity contributor (host, disk groups, datastores, and capacity disks). Next to that they can easily see both the total overall capacity they have versus the used disk space. One of the most interesting features is on the top left hand side; here admins can see the direct impact dedupe and compression is having on their vSAN storage. Beneath that is the cluster overview. Here users can select a cluster and immediately see if it needs to be rebalanced and the remaining capacity.\n\n\nRight-click and open in new tab for a larger image\n\nUpdated Features in vROps 6.6 for vSAN\n\nAs vSAN grows and gets adopted at a higher rate, it will see more issues arise, as is the case with any technology. The latest version has a more encompassing troubleshooting dashboard. Again it starts at the cluster level with a list of all available clusters. Admins can select a cluster and see if there are any alerts on the cluster, hosts, VMs, or disks. They can easily see if the relatives to the cluster are healthy as well. The dashboard shows if the cluster is busy and what level of performance is being affected.\n\n\nRight-click and open in new tab for a larger image\n\nScrolling farther down, admins can see if the write buffer is full (indicated in green) and whether or not the read IOs are being served by the cache. From here admins can take a closer look at the hosts including whether or not they are consistently configured, whether or not the host is busy, the disk groups within the selected host, and if there are any aborted IOPS in the disk group or bus resets in the disk group.\n\n\nRight-click and open in new tab for a larger image\n\nAnd scrolling down and diving further into this disk group activity with heat maps for Disk Cache (and whether or not there are any hardware issues) and capacity disks (and again if they are having hardware issues).\n\n\nRight-click and open in new tab for a larger image\n\nConclusion\n\nTo get access to all the operations goodies available to VMware vSAN users, vRealize Operations Standard is sold on a per CPU basis with a list pf $1250/CPU or per VM ($125/VM in 25 VM bundle). The benefits of vRealize Operations for vSAN are clearly a great value add, increasing for every vSAN cluster that needs to be administered. Admins that cover a large pool of remote/branch office locations will be even more happy to have this sort of actionable data at their fingertips without having to log into every cluster. Some of the best highlights in our view revolve around capacity planning and a clear indicator of data footprint savings with dedupe and compression for all-flash vSAN users. In the end though, this latest vROps update shows VMware's commitment to making admistration of vSAN both easier and more proactive.\n\nVMware vRealize Operations\n\nDicuss this review"}

Today, World Wrestling Entertainment\u2014now renamed, per a legal settlement with that more genteel WWF, the World Wildlife Fund\u2014trades on the New York Stock Exchange with a market capitalization of over $856 million.\n\nJim Barnett, one of the most powerful godfathers in the mid-twentieth century \"Territorial Era\" of wrestling promotion, boasted that he dealt with only three coteries: kings, prime ministers, and dictators. Barnett more typically dealt with sweaty jobbers and Georgia babyfaces, with names like \"The Continental Lover\" or \"Geeto Mongol,\" but the claim is perhaps not as ridiculous as it appears. Historically, professional wrestling, with its screaming neon lunatics, potbellied big daddies, and tasseled \"ring rats,\" has been considered too absurd to be taken seriously\u2014deprecated by sportswriters and ignored by politicians, its fans derided as low-class marks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis\u2014the notion that pro wrestling is a fixed, low-rent travesty, undeserving of serious mainstream scrutiny\u2014is the single greatest angle ever sold by the wrestling industry.\n\nPat O'Connor dropkicks Hans Hermann at Madison Square Garden in 1954.\n\nThere are competing theories as to the origin of the term \"kayfabe,\" beyond its provenance in the strange lingo of the carnivals from which American pro wrestling emerged. But as to the meaning, there is no confusion; it is the central axiom of the business. As explained by journalist David \"The Masked Man\" Shoemaker, kayfabe is \"the wrestlers' adherence to the big lie, the insistence that the unreal is real \u2026 the abiding dogma of the pro wrestling industry.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the flip side of kayfabe is that, in an industry where the unreal is real, where Hulk Hogan is a \"real American\" fighting for the rights of every man, truth wears a mask.\n\nNothing is more real\u2014and more obscured by the smoke and mirrors of the mat\u2014than a simple fact: the billion dollar spectacle of pro wrestling relies entirely on the ruthless economic, mental, and physical exploitation of its performers. In that world, of lingering physical ailments, screwjob employment contracts, and chugalug drug abuse, Hulk Hogan is a millionaire named Terry Bollea, a favorite of WWF management, poached from a Minneapolis wrestling promotion and transformed into the star of \"Hulkamania.\" In that world, in 1986, Bollea ratted out his fellow wrestlers to crush a nascent unionization drive ahead of Wrestlemania II. In that world, wrestlers are exploited and injured and thrown away\u2014their final contribution to the world, a mortality rate on par with day one of Antietam.\n\nFor a fake sport, pro wrestling sure has a lot of real casualties. Its only business model is fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProfessional wrestling's success was shepherded throughout the mid-twentieth century by the National Wrestling Alliance, a viciously anti-labor cartel comprised of the country's leading promoters. Colluding to control wages, stifle competition, and crush any resistant wrestlers, the NWA survived a federal antitrust investigation to dominate pro wrestling well into the seventies.\n\nYet it wasn't until recent decades that wrestling would grow unbelievably profitable, just as control of the entire industry came to rest with one corporation. On New Year's Day, 2014, WWE CEO and Chairman Vince McMahon could claim to be a billionaire in almost full control of the industry.\n\nBut these machinations are the stuff of rich men.

A pair of nurses talk about how sweet their relationship is, and we see Lloyd for the first time, now sporting a grizzly beard and basically catatonic in a wheelchair. Harry pleads for his friend to just say something\u2026 and it's at that point that Lloyd looks up and says, \"Got ya!\" revealing that he has been faking his coma-esque state the whole time. After a funny sequence featuring Harry trying to remove Lloyd's catheter all by himself (and then with the help of a few nearby gardeners and their flatbed truck), the best buds get out of the hospital and get ready to start their next adventure.\n\n\nAfter a few non-sequitur scenes and funny moments, the plot was then established: Harry gets a letter in the mail from his former lover Fraida Felcher (Kathleen Turner) who tells him that she is pregnant with his child. The problem is that the letter is actually from 1991, meaning that Harry has an adult daughter he knows nothing about. They then go to visit Fraida to inquire about the kid (including whether the mom had a C-Section or went \"Au Snatchural\"), and discover that the child was actually put up for adoption, leading Harry and Lloyd on a new road trip to find the missing daughter.\n\n\nIn the final (and grossest) scene of the Dumb and Dumber To footage, the duo are in a nursing home visiting an old woman who Lloyd believes to be his grandmother. Told that she is lying on top of some \"huge diamonds,\" Lloyd reaches under the blankets, but instead of finding precious jewels he instead accidentally starts \"pleasuring\" her (I'm trying to be as delicate as possible). It's at this time that the woman decides to tell him that she is not actually his grandmother, and that he can, \"Cross that one off your bucket list.\"\n\n\nI've been vocal about my apprehension of this sequel, as the Farrelly brothers most recent run of films haven't come close to reaching the level of their earlier work, but I must say that I am actually now somewhat looking forward to Dumb and Dumber To. The humor is certainly sophomoric, as you would expect, but it's also so over the top that it got a few chuckles out of me. Most importantly, I was amazed by how quickly my brain adjusted to seeing Daniels and Carrey back together in character, and it was so fun to see the duo that after the footage I immediately found myself wanting more. I'm definitely still a bit wary of the project and not 100% confident that it will work, but my optimism level has gone up.\n\n\nDumb and Dumber To will be in theaters on November 14th. It has been a full 20 years since Peter and Bobby Farrelly first introduced us to the characters Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne in the outrageous 90s comedy Dumb and Dumber , and this year the dynamic duo is finally coming back to the big screen. But while the sequel, titled Dumb and Dumber To , won't be out until the fall, earlier today we got our first ever peek at footage from the film at Universal Pictures' presentation at CinemaCon .

After all, that's what home-brewers do with beer all the time. But he won't end up in court, thanks to a key provision of the state's old distilling laws.\n\nMcGinn, a divorced dad who works at an area factory, lives alone in a ranch home just inside village limits on the outskirts of Princeville. The property rests along a winding road curving out of town into vast crop fields. It's far from the small commercial district in the town of 1,620 residents. To see the place, you have to want to get there. It's not as if many cars or kids wander by.\n\nEarlier this year, McGinn spotted the Discovery Channel show \"Moonshiners,\" about Appalachian bootleggers who try to stay a step ahead of the law. He wondered if he could brew his own white lightning.\n\n\"Everyone talks about moonshine,\" he says, laughing. \"So, you might as well try it yourself.\"\n\nRecipes and techniques are a lot easier to find nowadays than in the yesteryear of Al Capone and bathtub gin. On the Internet, McGinn found plenty of help regarding equipment, ingredients and techniques. The still's set-up was simple and cheap. The key parts: a rusty, 5-gallon metal milk jug and a plastic 55-gallon tub.\n\nOne of the first steps is making what's called \"moonshine mash,\" which involves heating up water, sugar, corn and yeast. To cut costs, he buys in bulk. When he bought a 200-pound sack of sugar - perhaps unusual for the average 32-year-old man - the store clerk looked at him funny.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he told the clerk, \"I like to make a lot of cookies.\"\n\nIn his garage, McGinn makes about 100 gallons of mash at a time, and each batch needs about 2 1/2 weeks to ferment. Then, 8 gallons at a time, he distills the mash, boiling and separating the mix to increase the alcohol concentration.\n\nWhen the process is done, the alcohol content hits 180 proof, or 90-percent alcohol. Many mass-produced liquors - vodka, rum, whiskey - are only about 80 proof. But 180 proof isn't to McGinn's liking: too strong.\n\n\"That's what gets people in trouble,\" he says, laughing. \"It's too dang easy to get drunk.\"\n\nSo, he cuts his concoction, bringing it down to a still-potent 120 proof.\n\nHe smiles at one of his quart jars, then crows, \"It's really smooth!\"\n\nHe's right. I've had corn squeezings made in a variety of places: central Illinois, the South, even the Third World. And McGinn's is the cleanest I've sampled, in taste and appearance.\n\nIt's also cheap. McGinn's out-of-pocket cost is about $10 a gallon. At liquor stores, decent whiskey runs four to five times that figure, with top-shelf brands far higher.\n\nBut McGinn - who has no police record - says he has never sold any of his moonshine. Police heard no such allegation: the anonymous tip complained only about an illegal still.\n\nMcGinn can't imagine who turned him in. His still sits in his garage, and the door is usually closed. He says there's no real safety issue. The only house in sight belongs to his mom, and she didn't call police. And he doesn't share enough of his product to"}

As promised, she did provide me a link to that information.\n\nhttp://www.provost.utoronto.ca/office/Provostial_Statements/Provost_s_Statement_on_Recent_Controversial_Events_on_Campus__December_2012_.htm\n\nHere is my response to her via email:\n\nThank you for sending this. It is unfortunately hard to respond in a comprehensive way. There is no direct mention from U of T admin about the abuse of students trying to enter the Farrell lecture. Nor is there any proof provided of the threats they mentioned, which they seem to indirectly attribute to AVFM. I suppose if you think that video evidence and public confession online of the acts that we addressed do not constitute sufficient proof, then perhaps you may also have questions for U of T admin regarding proof that any threats were made.\n\nPersonally, I am not buying it. I am 100% certain that no individual associated with AVFM would condone or tolerate any type of threat made against anyone. If I found out that anyone was, their connection with AVFM would be quickly severed. I am also 100% certain that the individuals who orchestrated the harassment, bullying, door blockading and vandalism that happened on November 16, have already spread a great deal of disinformation about AVFM, CAFE, Warren Farrell, Janice Fiamengo and others.\n\nI can sympathize that in the face of complaints that students are being harassed, real, imagined or concocted, U of T admin would likely feel obligated to issue a statement condemning such actions. I condemn them too, but I am not convinced they ever happened."}

In fact, it sounds exactly like the sort of thing that would be a primitive demo for one of the newer breed of Polish or Belgian or perhaps even Czech grindcore bands. Do I think the members of Lobster Apocalypse listen to a lot of Polish or Belgian grind? Fuck no. The energy and spirit is definitely similar though, as was the writing process, most likely.\n\n\nYou see, Lobster Apocalypse is primarily a joke band just because they haven't thought up appropriate lyrics and concepts to go along with their music. While a European band would layer some Engrishy gore or stilted political commentary, these Americans go for jokes instead. It's not really necessary, because, although the style isn't nearly as appreciated in the US as it is in eastern Europe, South America, or Asia, what they're playing is a legitimate style of spastic, violent grindcore that reminds me a bit of artists like Hybrid Viscery or maybe Brazil's MDK. If you handed this to me on tape and said it was the eighth demo from a Japanese grind band, I wouldn't bat an eye. It reflects that same sort of songwriting idea: the band has ideas, and they make them into songs even though they don't have ENOUGH ideas for songs, so things just sort of happen between real ideas instead of a transition between them being built.\n\n\nIt has a lot of spirit, and I like that. Subtract the art and song titles and you have a very convincing piece of grindcore. The vocals are fierce, the guitars tension-laced and atonal, and the drumming is savage and very brutal. Here's the question: do they NEED more songwriting, or do they just need fewer jokes? I'm actually leaning towards the latter. This sort of primitive, illogical grind is a breed of music that I really love. I'd probably like it more with a little less overt humor; I've never been big on 'joke bands' anyway. But I do think the music is good. The alien riffing, the too-brutal drumming, the chaotic vocals- it works, and it's just looking for an aesthetic to round it out."}

{"id": 1234, "ended": true, "length": 727, "text": "At sunset a beautiful young widow goes alone to an oak tree to meet a young man about to go into battle. But less than half way through this episode of the new BBC1 primetime drama, The White Queen, the romantic scene quickly turns violent. King Edward, played by Max Irons, refuses to accept that the woman's mere presence is not an open invitation to sex. \"I said no,\" says Elizabeth Woodville, played by Rebecca Ferguson. \"But you came,\" replies the king, sounding hurt.\n\nThe scene, written by Emma Frost, is as well done as any depiction of date rape in 1464 can be. Without giving too much away, Elizabeth does get to say: \"Don't doubt my courage\" which, she adds, is \"a match for any man\".\n\nWomen do play central roles in the series, based on the historical novels of Philippa Gregory. But when I watched this scene, I couldn't help but notice how common rape seems to have become as a dramatic device on primetime TV. Here, in a drama clearly pitched to become a Sunday-night blockbuster (even the soundtrack has Downton overtones), rape is casually introduced in order to show that the king, the ultimate in powerful men, thinks he can have what he wants.\n\nThis scene possibly had the greatest impact on those of us still suffering from the point, five minutes into episode two of Paula Milne's BBC2 drama The Politician's Husband, when David Tennant, as the emasculated MP Aiden Hoynes, anally raped his wife.\n\nShown last month, not long after the 9pm watershed, it caused uproar. TV critic Alison Graham wrote in the Radio Times that \"rape is much too serious to be used as a mere dramatic ploy\". It is hard not to agree that the scene, so soon after the couple had had consensual sex, seemed far too glib \u2013 effectively saying: \"Look, he has to debase her to feel manly again.\"\n\nIn its response the BBC said: \"This scene goes to the heart of the emotional story for the characters \u2026 while some viewers may find these scenes strong, they reflect the central themes of power and betrayal.\"\n\nIn her 1999 book Rape on Prime Time, Lisa Cuklanz charts shifts in the depiction of rape on television. Starting as a crime perpetrated by evil strangers in the 1970s, televisual representations of rape have changed over time, slowly turning their attention to the effect of sexual violence on the victim and by 1990, to portrayals of date and marital rape. The latter became a crime in all 50 states of the US in 1993 and in 1991 in the UK.\n\nBut has rape now become more common on our TV screens? With one in five women in England and Wales having experienced some form of sexual violence after the age of 16, television viewers are far more likely to have been affected by this crime than they are by, say, the murders so frequently depicted on our screens.\n\nThe main question, though, is whether it is becoming an all-too-easy dramatic shorthand. The first episodes of the cold war spy drama The Americans and Bates Motel \u2013 a prequel to the Alfred Hitchcock movie Psycho, coming to British TV soon \u2013 both feature rape scenes. But do these plot points add titillation rather than horror? In the White Queen, Elizabeth may not have been overcome by the king, but she did end up falling for him anyway. Perhaps part of the problem is that many of the audience did too."}

While information will continue to emerge about Thae and his motivations, here are five interesting facts that we know thus far.\n\nHe defected with his family\n\nThae was able to defect with his wife and children. Jeong Joon-hee, a spokesman for the South Korean Unification Ministry, noted in a press conference that Thae's defection was partially motivated by his concern for his family's future. It is widely reported that in order to deter potential defections, North Korea often punishes relatives still in North Korea. Although the method of Thae's defection with his family is unknown, the fact that he could secure his immediate family's safety likely played a large role in his decision.\n\nHe was scheduled to return to Pyongyang\n\nSteve Evans, a BBC Korea correspondent, noted that Thae was scheduled to return to Pyongyang with his family. Although it is merely speculation at his point, Thae's pending return to North Korea may have troubled him because of fear of regime retribution upon his arrival. Evans speculated that negative press about North Korea in the British media may have caused Thae to draw the regime's ire. In addition, some experts have noted that with increased scrutiny of North Korea's illicit activities, diplomats such as Thae may be having a hard time meeting quotas of gold, cigarettes and other valuable items they used to smuggle back to Pyongyang.\n\nHe is the highest-ranking North Korean diplomat to defect in nearly 20 years\n\nAs the second highest ranked North Korean diplomat in London, Thae's defection makes him the highest-ranking diplomat to defect since 1997, when North Korean Ambassador to Egypt Jang Seung-gil sought asylum with his wife at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. Jang Seung-gil was also scheduled to return to Pyongyang at the time of his defection.\n\nHe lived in London for 10 years\n\nThae worked in London for 10 years, which is an unusually long post for a North Korean diplomat. He was thoroughly engrossed in British suburban living, having taken up membership at a local tennis club, and he frequently played golf. Regarding Thae's adjustment to British life, Evans commented, \"He seemed so at home. He seemed so middle-class, so conservative, so dapper.\"\n\nHe escorted Kim Jong-un's brother to an Eric Clapton concert\n\nThae escorted Kim Jong-chul, elder brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and son of Kim Jong-il, to an Eric Clapton concert at Royal Albert Hall in 2015. A BBC video shows Thae with Kim Jong-chul emerging from a vehicle to enter the concert hall, which can be viewed here.\n\nJuni Kim is the Program Manager and Executive Assistant at the Korea Economic Institute of America (KEI).

{"id": 1236, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Like Ferguson before it, the upheavals in Baltimore have been linked by numerous historians to the legacy of slavery.\n\nWhile the impact of slavery followed by segregation is clear to see in the poverty, marginalisation, mass incarceration and prejudice with which African Americans have to live through, it is by no means a uniquely American experience - the whole world is struggling to deal with the legacy of one human claiming ownership of another.\n\nOwing to its superpower status and the harsh cruelty of its particular brand of enslavement, the American experience has become the global benchmark. But the reality of slavery is far more diverse. Although Africa is the continent most bled by slavery, slaves have been of all races, nations and groups. The very word \"slave\" refers to the \"Slavs\", who were a major source of slavery in medieval Europe.\n\nEven in the Americas, there were some white slaves, who predated their black counterparts at a time when Africans were too expensive to be economically viable. For the British, the earliest sources of slaves for their American colonies were drawn from their prototype colony, Ireland.\n\nForgotten episode\n\nEngland's blood-soaked reconquest of Ireland in the 17th century - led by theocratic dictator and Protestant Puritan Oliver Cromwell - involved clearing vast swaths of the country of its Irish Catholic inhabitants. Many thousands of the displaced were sent to the Caribbean as slaves.\n\nSome historians who remember this forgotten episode prefer to use the term \"indentured servant\" but, to my mind, this is just a euphemism for slave, since these so-called servants were \"personal property, and they or their descendants could be sold or inherited\". In fact, an English adventurer of the time described these hapless Irish as \"derided by the negroes, and branded with the Epithet of 'white slaves'\".\n\nOwing to the Islamic restrictions on enslaving 'people of the book', by the 14th century, Africa was the primary source of slaves in the Middle East.\n\nBy one of those quirks of history, this brings us to another Baltimore, this time in Ireland. In 1631, this village in Cork was sacked by Barbary pirates, whose inhabitants - mainly English settlers whose compatriots would a few years later enslave the Irish - were carried off into slavery.\n\nBetween 1530 and 1780, these Muslim pirates captured more than one million Christian Europeans, according to one estimate, causing the inhabitants of many coastal areas of Europe to flee in fear.\n\nFrom our contemporary vantage point after centuries of Western global dominance, it is hard to fathom that Europeans were ever slaves. But Middle Eastern slave markets were well-stocked with them. These included, at various periods, Caucasians (ie, from the Caucasus), Slavs, Albanians, Greeks and even Norse people.\n\nHowever, owing to the Islamic restrictions on enslaving \"people of the book\", by the 14th century, Africa was the primary source of slaves in the Middle East. Perhaps as many as 14 million Africans were carried off into slavery by Arabs/Muslims, comparable to the Transatlantic slave trade, albeit over a longer period.\n\nArab and Muslim world\n\nSlavery in the Arab and Muslim world differed significantly from that practised in the Americas. Though, like in America, many slaves were engaged in back-breaking work in abysmal conditions, perhaps the majority were employed as servants, concubines and soldiers. In addition, freeing slaves was considered a noble act in Islam and, hence, many were liberated.\n\nMoreover, not all were of a lowly status. A fortunate minority of slaves enjoyed a higher social status than free men and women. For instance, one of the most creative eras of my native country, Egypt's history occurred under the Mamluks, slave warriors raised to rule, and the only woman to govern Egypt in the Islamic era was Shagaret el-Dur, a former slave girl.\n\nBut I'm doubtful that such prestige or power compensated its holder for the early trauma of being kidnapped from their family and regarded as someone else's property.\n\nThough viewed more negatively, African slaves, too, could rise to high positions of influence. One example of this was the position of Kizlar Agha, the Ottoman chief eunuch and the third most influential position in the Sultan's court.\n\nFor various complex reasons, slavery took longer to die out in the Arab world than in the West, with the countries of the Gulf not abolishing it until the mid-20th century. Despite this, the social, economic, political and cultural legacy of slavery are given very little attention in the Arab world.\n\nFor example, though the long and diverse history of slavery in the Arab world means that just about anyone of us could have a slave as an ancestor, the insult \"abeed\" (slaves) - which has even made it across the Atlantic - is only used to deride those of African"}

{"id": 1239, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "In the late '80s, the founder of a support group for adopted children who had recently reconnected with their biological relatives coined the term \"Genetic Sexual Attraction\" (GSA) to describe the intense romantic and sexual feelings that she observed occurring in many of these reunions. According to an article in The Guardian, experts estimate that these taboo feelings occur in about 50 percent of cases where estranged relatives are reunited as adults (GSA's discoverer had herself become attracted to the son she'd adopted out when she met him 26 years later, but her feelings were not reciprocated).\n\nThough the research is scarce, those who have studied GSA offer a range of possible explanations for it, including a primordial feeling of always having \"belonged\" to the estranged relative, a sense of wanting to experience the bonding missed out on during childhood, or simply an overwhelming closeness based on similarities: like meeting a mate who was designed for you in a science lab. Perhaps GSA accounts for Kevin Gates's attraction to his first cousin.\n\nConsensual incest between fathers and their daughters remains the least reported and perhaps the most taboo sort of GSA relationship. Keith Pullman, who runs a marriage equality blog, has personally talked to over 20 GSA couples and notes that he's only had a few father-daughter couples speak out, speculating that many of them fear that others will assume the daughter must have been abused in childhood (it should be said that when these unions lead to children, those children can face potentially serious difficulties as a result of the genetic implications of incest, even if some online communities downplay these risks).\n\nHere, an 18-year-old woman from the Great Lakes region describes her romantic relationship of almost two years with the biological father she met after 12 years of estrangement.\n\nWhat was your family like when you were growing up?\n\nMy parents had me when they were 18 \u2014 they met in high school and I was conceived on prom night. They were serious for about six months but broke up while my mom was still pregnant with me. My dad wasn't there when I was born. I think my mom's psychological problems meant the relationship never really worked out. She has bipolar disorder and some other mental health issues. They just weren't happy and didn't really keep in contact after I was born. She wanted to do it alone. When she's manic it's hard to know what she's going to say. After I was born she had a nervous breakdown and couldn't take care of me, so I lived with her grandparents until I was about 2. I think that's part of the reason we've never been close: We didn't bond when I was a baby.\n\nDid you have any contact with your father when you were a child?\n\nHe briefly came back into my life when I was about 3 or 4 and I saw him on weekends until I was about 5. He lived about an hour away from us and my parents constantly argued about visitation. He was always doing the drive to see me because my mom wasn't very fond of it \u2014 she wouldn't even meet him halfway.\n\nCan you remember much from your time with your dad when you were little?\n\nI have some memories. He spoiled me rotten. I had this giant storage tote of Barbie dolls and I had my own Mary-Kate and Ashley bedroom. It was a little girl's dream. We'd sit in the yard blowing bubbles together, and he took me to the zoo where he bought me a stuffed animal that I kept until I was 16. I ended up washing it and stupidly put it in the dryer, which melted all its fur. I remember he gave me a miniature tea set. I still have it.\n\nSo then there was zero contact or word from him?\n\nWhen I was about 15 he emailed my mom saying he'd like to see me. I vividly remember the moment she told me. I said I missed him and wouldn't mind seeing him. She asked me how I could miss someone I hadn't been with for such a long time. But what I missed was a fatherly figure. My mom's always picked the wrong guy out of the crowd and she's had a couple of divorces. I'm still not really close with my current stepfather even though they've been together for ten years. For whatever reason, my father and I didn't end up meeting for two more years, so there was no contact for 12 years \u2014 we were reunited when I was 17.\n\nSo what were your feelings toward him when you were growing up? Did you think about him much?\n\nI'd wonder where he was, what he was doing. Why haven't I seen him or heard from him? What did my mom do? What did he do? What did I do? My abandonment issues really hit when I was a teenager. My mom and my stepfather took a break because they were fighting so much and I cried the entire"}

Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: New details have emerged about the FBI's efforts to turn Muslim Americans living abroad into government informants. An expos\u00e9 in Mother Jones magazine chronicles the story of an American named Naji Mansour. After he refused to become an informant while he was living in Kenya, he saw his life and his family's life turned upside down. He was detained, repeatedly interrogated and ultimately forced into exile in Sudan, unable to see his children for years.\n\nHe ended up spending 37 days in a squalid prison in Sudan. After he was released from prison, FBI agents approached him again. This time Naji Mansour decided to record the phone conversation. During the call, the agent informs Mansour that he might get, quote, \"hit by a car.\" On Thursday, the phone recording was published by Mother Jones. Take a listen.\n\nFBI AGENT: If you did have any kind of business going on today or any kind of things like that, you're going to find how miniscule and worthless it was compared to this fork in the road that you're about to\u2014that you're about to take.\n\nNAJI MANSOUR: What are you talking about? No, why don't you come out and say it?\n\nFBI AGENT: OK.\n\nNAJI MANSOUR: Why don't you come out and say? What fork in the road are you talking about?\n\nFBI AGENT: Dude, it's\u2014whatever. Honestly, I don't care. I'm getting out of here. I don't care. OK? And it's\u2014you know, when I tell somebody, \"Hey, you know what? If you cross the street without looking, you're going to get run over,\" that's not a threat, [bleep]; that's advice [bleep], OK? You're about to cross the street without looking both ways, and I'm telling you, \"You know what? You might get hit by a car.\" That is not a threat. That is a solid piece of the advice. So you don't want to take it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That was a phone conversation of an unidentified FBI agent pressuring Naji Mansour to become an informant. Mansour's story is the focus of a new piece in Mother Jones titled \"This American Refused to Become an FBI Informant. Then the Government Made His Family's Life Hell.\"\n\nWe're joined now by Naji Mansour via Democracy Now! from Sudan. And joining us from Washington, D.C., is journalist is Nick Baumann, who wrote the piece for Mother Jones magazine.\n\nNick, let's begin with you. Just lay out this whole story.\n\nNICK BAUMANN: As you heard, this is a story about Naji Mansour, who refused to become an informant for the FBI, and sort of what happened to him and his family, especially his family, after he made that fateful decision. And the way I start the story, and I think the best place to start, is with Naji's mom, who's a longtime U.S. government employee, and his sister, and they're in Juba in South Sudan. And it's the middle of the night, late at night. Juba is a very dangerous place. And they're actually wandering the streets looking for Naji, because he's been disappeared. They don't know where he is. They've been told by his wife that\u2014who was held with him and then released, that he's being held in a blue building somewhere, but they don't know where that is. And imagine just if this is your child or your brother, and you're an American living abroad, just having no idea where that person is and having to search for them. And Naji believes\u2014and I think with\u2014he has a few good reasons to believe this\u2014that the U.S. government sort of orchestrated the bad things that happened to him and his family.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And, Naji Mansour, could you tell us how it is that you've later discovered that you came into the crosshairs of the FBI? Why did they begin to target you initially? And talk about those early\u2014the early experiences you had.\n\nNAJI MANSOUR: Well, basically, in 2008, I was working in Dubai in an IT company. And due to the financial crisis, I had come back to Nairobi in late 2008. I had gone early 2009 to cancel my visa, and then I returned to Nairobi. I had, on numerous occasions, offered my place in Kenya, or my\u2014actually, our family house in Kenya to a lot of travelers or anybody who would like to come by.

I've done my very best to teach him to form his own opinions and how to separate rhetoric from fact.

He may not understand all the issues or all the political nuances, but he thinks these folks are heroes, too, because he has seen their commitment to public service.\n\nThen my son watched Trump lie and bully his way into winning the Republican nomination.\n\nDuring the presidential election, I had to explain that Trump was lying when he purposely mischaracterized illegal immigrants as rapists and murders. I had to explain that all Muslims weren't terrorists and why anti-Semitism was on the rise.\n\nI had to explain why Trump kept saying that Obama wasn't a U.S. citizen. I had to explain why so many women have accused Trump of fondling them and, of course, I had to explain the Access Hollywood tape to my ten year-old son.\n\nWhether it was Trump's claim about not supporting the Iraq War or the thousands of lies he told about his opponent, I was constantly explaining Trump's lies and fabrications to my son.

I had to tell him that inner cities weren't all crime-ridden hell holes where everyone ran the risk of being shot.\n\nLike many Americans, I had hoped desperately that once the campaign was over that Trump would embrace some semblance of statesmanship. I hoped that he'd quit his angry juvenile tweets and abandon his predilection for far-fetched conspiracy theories.\n\nInstead, Trump just keeps doubling down against every value and character trait that I've worked so hard to teach my son. Now, I'm having to explain why Trump thinks it's ok to pollute, why Big Bird is about to get laid off, and why millions won't have healthcare.\n\nI have to explain why President Trump made up a story about being \"wiretapped\" by President Obama.

We interviewed a host of soy experts on both sides of the fence. And from our in-depth research, came this article. Hopefully, it helps you sort through the big soy protein controversy, leaving you with some practical strategies for soy consumption.\n\nA Brief History of Soy\n\nSome of the first crops grown \u2013 way back in the 11th century BC \u2013 were soybeans. These beans are native to East Asia, and it's no surprise that Asian cultures are known as innovators when it comes to soy products.\n\nThe three most important foods derived from soy are things that are fairly common nowadays like miso, tofu, and tempeh. Interestingly, these foods have long been considered as both a source of nutrition and medicine in East Asia.\n\nIt wasn't until the early 1700's that soy was introduced to Europe. Shortly thereafter, in 1765, the first soybean plant was grown in North America.\n\nSoy was initially grown in North American to feed animals. It didn't become a human food crop until the early 1900's. My, how times have changed. Today, 55% of total soy production originates in the United States.\n\nHowever, what's grown today ain't your grandmother's soy.\n\nGenetically modified soybeans were introduced in 1995. These modifications were made to reinforce the crop against pests as well as against the chemicals farmers spray to prevent weed growth (think Round-Up).\n\nInterestingly, about 13 years later, about 90% of the soybeans produced are genetically modified in one way or another.\n\nWhat's in This Mean Bean?\n\nIn terms of protein content, the soybean is roughly 41% protein. And the PDCAA score (a measure of protein quality) for soybeans is just below 1.0, with soy protein isolate at 1.0. Since 1.0 is the highest score a protein can get, soy ranks right up there with milk, beef, and eggs.\n\nWhen breaking down the specific amino acids, soy is rich in branched chain amino acids, lysine, and arginine, while being low in methionine and cysteine. To this end, soy protein is still \"complete\" in terms of the full amino acid profile. However, due to the lower methionine and cysteine content, it's marginal in this regard. Some experts consider soy a touch inferior to animal-based proteins.\n\n\"I call this one 'Dinner.'\"\n\nIn terms of dietary fat, the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids in soybeans is about 1:7, which is sensible. Especially when compared to oils like sunflower and peanut, which are 1:100+.\n\nFinally, soybeans contain a mix of slow-digesting carbohydrates. With fiber and other starches that may be good for promoting the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut, soy could be considered gastrointestinal-friendly (assuming no soy maldigestion or allergy).\n\nIs Anyone Actually Eating Soy?\n\nContrary to popular belief, cultural observation tells us that most traditional cuisines \u2013 even Asian \u2013 don't incorporate soy as a staple.\n\nThe average soy intake in East Asian populations is between 40 to 90 grams per day (1.5 to 3 ounces). Folks, that's totalsoy intake, not grams of soy protein. This amount of soy equates to roughly 10 to 20 grams of soy protein per day, which is actually less than the daily allowance of protein recommended by the FDA.\n\nIn these cultures, soy is generally used as an occasional meat replacement or as a condiment to the main dish. In China, tofu has been nicknamed \"the meat without bones,\" because of its versatility in creating so many meat-like replacement products.\n\nCollect 'em all.\n\nIn North America, unfortunately, refined soy foods \u2013 things like soy concentrates, textured soy, soy lecithin, etc. \u2013 are finding their way into more foods on supermarket shelves. Also unfortunate, they"}

Based on high-resolution X-ray computed tomographic (CT) scans, the study, published today in Nature, takes a comprehensive look at the so-called \"bird brain.\"\n\nContrary to the clich\u00e9, the term describes a relatively enlarged brain that has the capacity required for flight and was present in one of the earliest known birds, Archaeopteryx. In the new study, scientists reveal that at least a few non-avian dinosaurs had brains that were as large or larger than that of Archaeopteryx, indicating that some dinosaurs already suspected of possessing flight capability would have had the neurological hardwiring necessary for this behavior.\n\n\"Archaeopteryx has always been set up as a uniquely transitional species between feathered dinosaurs and modern birds, a halfway point,\" said lead author Amy Balanoff, a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History and a postdoctoral researcher at Stony Brook University. \"But by studying the cranial volume of closely related dinosaurs, we learned that Archaeopteryx might not have been so special.\"\n\nBirds can be distinguished from other living reptiles by their brains, which are enlarged compared to body size. This \"hyperinflation,\" most obvious in the forebrain, is important for providing the superior vision and coordination required to fly. But scientists are increasingly finding that features once considered exclusive to modern birds, such as feathers and the presence of wishbones, are now known to have first appeared in non-avian dinosaurs. The new study provides more evidence to add the hyperinflated brain to that list.\n\nThe researchers used CT scanners at the University of Texas, Ohio University, Stony Brook University, and the Museum to peer inside the braincases of more than two dozen specimens, including modern birds, Archaeopteryx, and closely related non-avian dinosaurs like tyrannosaurs. By stitching together the CT scans, the scientists created 3-D reconstructions of the skulls' interiors. In addition to calculating the total volume of each digital brain cast, the research team also determined the size of each brain's major anatomical regions, including the olfactory bulbs, cerebrum, optic lobes, cerebellum, and brain stem.\n\n\"The story of brain size is more than its relationship to body size,\" said coauthor Gabriel Bever, an assistant professor of anatomy at the New York Institute of Technology. \"If we also consider how the different regions of the brain changed relative to each other, we can gain insight into what factors drove brain evolution as well as what developmental mechanisms facilitated those changes.\"\n\nThe researchers found that in terms of volumetric measurements, Archaeopteryx is not in a unique transitional position between non-avian dinosaurs and modern birds. Several other non-avian dinosaurs sampled, including bird-like oviraptorosaurs and troodontids, actually had larger brains relative to body size than Archaeopteryx.\n\n\"If Archaeopteryx had a flight-ready brain, which is almost certainly the case given its morphology, then so did at least some other non-avian dinosaurs,\" Balanoff said.\n\nThe researchers also examined another factor that is important to flight in modern birds: a neurological structure called the wulst, which is used in information processing and motor control. The team identified an indentation in the digital brain cast of Archaeopteryx that might be homologous to the wulst seen in living birds. But this indentation is not found in non-avian dinosaurs that have bigger brains than Archaeopteryx, presenting the research team with a new question to explore in the future."}

Because foods are not consumed in isolation, dietary pattern (DP) analysis of food combination, taking into account the interactions among food components, may offer methodological advantages.\n\nDESIGN: Prospective cohort study.\n\nSETTING: Northern Manhattan, New York, New York.\n\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand one hundred forty-eight community-based elderly subjects (aged > or = 65 years) without dementia in New York provided dietary information and were prospectively evaluated with the same standardized neurological and neuropsychological measures approximately every 1.5 years. Using reduced rank regression, we calculated DPs based on their ability to explain variation in 7 potentially AD-related nutrients: saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin E, vitamin B(12), and folate. The associations of reduced rank regression-derived DPs with AD risk were then examined using a Cox proportional hazards model. Main Outcome Measure Incident AD risk.\n\nRESULTS: Two hundred fifty-three subjects developed AD during a follow-up of 3.9 years. We identified a DP strongly associated with lower AD risk: compared with subjects in the lowest tertile of adherence to this pattern, the AD hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for subjects in the highest DP tertile was 0.62 (0.43-0.89) after multivariable adjustment (P for trend = .01). This DP was characterized by higher intakes of salad dressing, nuts, fish, tomatoes, poultry, cruciferous vegetables, fruits, and dark and green leafy vegetables and a lower intake of high-fat dairy products, red meat, organ meat, and butter.\n\nCONCLUSION: Simultaneous consideration of previous knowledge regarding potentially AD-related nutrients and multiple food groups can aid in identifying food combinations that are associated with AD risk."}

The Tigers were stiff, but you make your own luck\n\nYes they were unlucky to lose another heartbreaker, but for the second week running, the Richmond players only have themselves to blame. The visitors dominated every aspect of the match against the Giants, but failed their biggest test when the pressure lifted in the final term. Jason Castagna, from 40m out, then the experienced Dustin Martin, from even closer, missed simple set shots in the first two minutes of the last quarter that would have put the Tigers up by more than five goals. Their structures then failed them again in the dying stages after the Giants had stormed back into the game when, after a Shai Bolton goal was overturned by a score review, Richmond failed to have anyone on the mark for Nathan Wilson's kick in. It allowed the GWS defender \u2013 one of the league's best kicks \u2013 to play on and launch a 70m bomb to the centre square, where an intelligent punch from Phil Davis saw the footy end up with Jeremy Cameron, who slotted the winner. Heath Shaw then set up the home side perfectly to defend for the remaining 59 seconds \u2013 something the Tigers didn't do last week \u2013 and the result was another four points gone begging for the yellow and black. - Adam Curley\n\n2. The Bulldogs are still trying to find their mojo\n\nBulldogs coach Luke Beveridge compared his side's form fluctuations to a mystery out of science fiction TV show The X Files. At 5-4, the Bulldogs are still right in the thick of the finals race, but are not close to playing the football that saw them win last year's flag. One of the main areas of concern is the ruck department. Cats ruckman Zac Smith was a major contributor to his side's win, outsizing Tom Boyd, Travis Cloke and Lin Jong in a few contests. Luckily, Jordan Roughead got through his VFL comeback from a hamstring injury unscathed and should push for selection against the Saints next week. The Bulldogs need a big man with presence and Roughead should be able to provide that. - Ben Guthrie\n\n3. Sydney can make September\n\nThe Swans won their last two games in convincing fashion against the Brisbane Lions and North Melbourne, but their 50-point win against St Kilda was different. Alan Richardson's side had won three straight, proven their bona fides against Greater Western Sydney a fortnight ago and looked like a side that will either make finals or push hard for September action. Despite that, Sydney made the Saints look second rate. John Longmire was thrilled with his team's pressure around the ball and with star midfielders Josh Kennedy, Dan Hannebery and Luke Parker firing, the Swans look to be back to their best. They ended up with 12 goalkickers, a spread that will cause headaches for every other club in the competition. - Dinny Navaratnam\n\nLance Franklin had a purple patch in the last quarter against the Saints. #AFLSaintsSwans pic.twitter.com/LUCEEhSsxA \u2014 AFL (@AFL) May 20, 2017\n\n4. Rory Sloane can work through a tag\n\nAfter two weeks being blanketed by opposition taggers, Rory Sloane was always going to have company against the Lions. It was no surprise to see young Nick Robertson line up on the star midfielder at the first bounce, but unlike previous weeks against Sam Gibson and Bernie Vince, this time Sloane would finish triumphant. Robertson, although younger and less accomplished than the Kangaroo and Demon, is strong-bodied, a superb runner, and had shut down Isaac Smith the previous week. But when Crows coach Don Pyke said Sloane had learnt from his previous outings, he wasn't lying. If he couldn't win ball on the outside, Sloane got it at the coalface, with 19 of his 31 disposals contested, including eight clearances. Sloane will likely get plenty more practise against taggers in coming weeks, but this was a big step forward. - Michael Whiting\n\n5. Collingwood has not given up\n\nThe response from the Magpies determined the tenor of the night. If they had not comeback hard questions would have been asked of the Collingwood coach and the club all week. While those questions may still be asked down the track, one that can't be is the investment this group have in the coach and their teammates. The Magpies outscored Hawthorn by 10 goals after the first break, which given the weight on their collective shoulders at quarter-time was an extraordinary effort. Scott Pendlebury led the charge in a match-winning manner more often ascribed to Geelong stars Joel Selwood and Patrick Dangerfield these days. It's been a tough year but the Magpies are hanging in there. - Peter Ryan\n\nA brilliant handball released Scott Pendlebury who was never going to miss! #AFL"}

{"id": 1253, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Tradition holds that red wines are for drinking during cold weather because they have a tendency to warm you and that white wines are for summer months when you want a cooler drink.\n\nConvention also says that red wines are served at room temperature while whites are served cold. But for wine drinkers who prefer red wines, there is a conflict.\n\nSuppose you want to continue to drink your red wine, but desire a cooler temperature?\n\nIt is a conundrum that never seems to go away \u2013 should you put ice cubes in your red wine if you desire a cool drink?\n\nOf course, you can do whatever you like, but is it a good solution?\n\nAdding ice to your wine is often looked upon with disdain by other wine drinkers after all the wine maker has gone to great lengths to craft the wine's flavor. So yes, wine temperature is a matter of personal preference, but it is also a matter of science.\n\nWine Temperatures 101\n\nWine temperature is a key element in knowing how to best store and serve your wines. The rules are not set in stone, but there are several guides that can help you keep your wine at its best flavor and prevent chemical deterioration.\n\nGuest blogger Kate Robinson posted the Wine Serving and Storage Temperatures 101 article, which includes helpful guides for the optimum temperature for serving and storing red wines.\n\nFor storing temperatures there are no solid rules. For red wines, the best place for storage is a cool and dark place void of sunlight and away from excessive heat. Excessive heat and light can ruin a good wine by causing its chemicals to deteriorate.\n\nIce Cubes in Red wine?\n\nRobinson states that most red wines should be served at temperatures between 60F to 68F (16C to 20C). This sets the temperature just below room temperature so that the wine is not overly warmed.\n\nWhen red wine is served too cold it can result in an unpleasant acidic taste and more prominent tannins. Lower temperatures have a tendency to suppress the wine's aroma and chemical makeup.\n\nAroma and mouth feel are two critical components of wine tasting. Within each glass of wine are various combinations of flavors and aromas, such as apple, blackberries, oak, rose petal, vanilla, and cherry (just to name a few). Simply put, adding an ice to your glass of red wine prevents the chemicals from escaping into the air and giving the wine the taste that it is intended to have.\n\nThe cold delivered by the ice cubes will cause the wine to quickly lose its taste.\n\nThe problem becomes even more exaggerated when the melted ice adds more water to the wine further diluting the aromas. This dilution also affects the acidity and tannins in the wine that then diminishes the intensity of the mouth feel.\n\nCarolyn F. Ross and Karen Weller have detailed the sensory effects of wine and temperature in an article published in The Journal of Sensory Studies. The title of their study is Effect of Serving Temperature on the Sensory Attributes of Red and White Wines.\n\nThe purpose of the study was to examine the sensory impact of the serving temperature of wines on prominent wine sensory qualities. While it is common practice to serve red wine at room temperature because it is thought to enhance wine aroma while quieting the bitterness often found in red wines, there has been little scientific research that addresses the effect of serving temperatures on wine attributes.\n\nCarolyn Ross also pairs up with John Reganold in creating a very readable bulleted informative document for wine lovers. This document provides the reader with charts and graphs explaining the science behind the making and enjoying of wine with a particular emphasis on the sensory experience of wine drinking.\n\nScience or no science, you just want to enjoy your red wine chilled. There are some alternative ways for you to do this without severely altering the attributes of the wine.\n\nChilling Wine\n\nChilling your wine is simply that \u2013 chilling. You don't want to drop ice cubes into your wine glass or you will end up with a diluted flat tasting wine and alter the wine's attributes.\n\nHere are some alternative ways to chill your red wine without the use of ice cubes.\n\n\u2022 Ice Bucket \u2013 Place the bottle into an ice bucket for approximately fifteen minutes.\n\n\u2022 Refrigerator \u2013 Place the wine bottle in a refrigerator for fifteen to thirty minutes. You want to reinvigorate the wine, not turn it into slush.\n\n\u2022 Wine Chillers \u2013 There are currently products on the market that are made to chill your wine. They fit into the wine bottle and can cool down room temperature reds.\n\n\u2022 Grapes \u2013 Chill the wine with the fruit that it is made with. Purchase grapes, and place them in the freezer. Add about four grapes to your wine glass and in less than five minutes it will drop the temperature approximately twenty degrees.\n\n\u2022 Wine Cubes \u2013 Instead of using ice"}

Income Tax\n\nAny person who lived in the District of Columbia for at least 183 days during the course of the year must file a D.C. tax return (if he or she was required to file a federal tax return). The D.C. income tax consists of six tax brackets, with rates from 4% to 8.95%.

This is derived from federal adjusted gross income (AGI), which includes salaries, wages, interest, dividends, capital gains (described in further detail below), rental income and royalties. However, a number of adjustments can be made to that total to reduce taxable income, as can deductions and exemptions.\n\nFor example, part-year residents can subtract income earned while they were not living in D.C. Any Social Security income that is taxed federally can also be subtracted, as can interest from U.S. debt obligations, long-term care insurance premiums and contributions to D.C. College Savings Plans (up to $4000 for single filer or $8000 for joint filers).\n\nAfter adjustments have been made, you can apply deductions. The standard deduction in D.C. for the 2017 tax year is $5,650. Married couples filing jointly can claim a standard deduction of $10,275 and those filing as a head of household have a deduction of $7,800. You can also claim itemized deductions in D.C. These are equal to the total of your federal itemized deductions, less the amount you claimed for either the state and local income tax deduction or the state and local general sales tax deduction.\n\nThe last step is to apply exemptions. The exemption amount in Washington, D.C. is $1,775. Multiply this amount by the number of exemptions listed on your federal income tax return to get your total exemption, which, along with deductions, can be subtracted from your adjusted gross income to calculate taxable income.

T-Mobile also shared that overall industry postpaid porting ratios are improving vs. the previous quarter, including ports with each of the three major wireless carriers over Q2 2016.\n\nT-Mobile's customer flow in Q3 2016 continues to come from all three major wireless carriers who are generous contributors and these numbers are already ahead of Q2 2016 full quarter results. T-Mobile estimates that Verizon has contributed over 250K postpaid phone and prepaid net customer additions to T-Mobile quarter-to-date, while AT&T has donated nearly 400K and nearly 300K have come from Sprint. In addition to these, T-Mobile continues to see strong flows of new first time customers coming to market, customers adding lines to their existing accounts and to a lesser degree switching from brands other than the big 3.

At the time, the president said he was responding to an appeal on Twitter by the supermodel, Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\n\nBut Temer has since approved several similar measures, including the latest one this week, which prompted an angry response from B\u00fcndchen. \"SHAME!

By Jacquelyn Landis - 1 minute read\n\nWe writers often have to contend with compound words that begin their life as two words only to eventually morph into one. \"Backyard\" is a good example. It originally was two words, \"back yard,\" used to describe the area behind a house. Sometime in the mid-1600s, it successfully made the transition to a single compound word.\n\nThen there are other compounds that are in limbo, somewhere in the midst of the transition from two words to one. Consider \"health care,\" a topic on everyone's mind these days. If you Google it, you'll get about 63 million returns for the two-word compound but a whopping 129 million for the single word \"healthcare.\" That's a good indicator that the single word will soon be standard. However, most style manuals still mandate the two-word version.\n\nTo complicate matters even further, we have words with separate meanings as a single-word compound or as two individual words. \"Anyway\" and \"any way\" are two that often perplex writers. These are entirely different terms that do indeed have distinct meanings.\n\n\"Anyway\" is an adverb, and it means regardless or in any event:\n\nMarshall's grades have slipped, but he plans to apply to Harvard anyway.\n\n\"Any way\" is a paired adjective and noun meaning any particular course, direction, or manner:\n\nChloe is willing to help Marshall prepare for the SAT in any way she can.\n\nThen we have \"anyways,\" a colloquial corruption of \"anyway.\" It's universally considered nonstandard and should be avoided altogether.

And, who had nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd, our goal there, in my view, is to work and lean strongly on China to put as much pressure. China is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for North Korea, and I think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on China.

He has always been a match-winner but he needs to do it consistently,\" Giggs said in The People.\n\n\"This season he has already made seven or eight goals and scored a couple but he can do better as well and improve and there is more to come.\n\n\"He's definitely beginning to add something that perhaps we lacked since Cristiano left and he's filling that gap better now. Those strikes from outside the box and the type of run and goal we saw at Bolton recently show that he's got that in him.\n\nCapable\n\n\"What he needs to do now is add more goals to his game.

When they first come they probably don't know their defensive duties as well in 4-4-2.\n\n\"But I've played a lot of that and I understand what is needed from a player who plays out wide and has an attacking role. You speak to those in your position all the time and Nani is very good at listening to that kind of advice.\n\n\"I have experience to pass on to the younger players and I do that with Nani. He needs to get more composure in the final third but he is still relatively young and I am certain he will add more goals to his game.\"\n\nNani would be advised to listen to what Giggs has to say as the Welshman has spent 20 years at the top of the game, playing alongside and learning from some of the biggest names in the business.\n\nHe said: \"When I joined United I honestly never thought it would last this long.

The incident was captured by a camera mounted on the officer.\n\nIn the video, the officer can be seen shooting at the speeding car while the driver swerves across the road. In two instances, the car narrowly missed children, until they lose control in the middle of the road.\n\nThe chase started when police picked up on a tracker signal from a car that was stolen during a house robbery in Ga-Rankuwa.

A high speed chase began with the suspects disregarding the rules of the road and endangering the lives of locals.\n\n\"They skipped a stop sign at speeds well over 120km/h. The officer started shooting at the vehicle when he realised they were endangering the lives of others.

At that moment, the officer fired about four shots, hitting the rear tyre in a bid to stop them from driving off. A man in a white T-shit jumped out and ran into nearby houses.\n\nThe driver was arrested and more officers arrived at the scene.

{"id": 1266, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "For as long as it has been popular in the West, yoga has always struggled to reconcile its noble traditions of using physical postures to bring calmness to the brain with the West's glorification of the aesthetic benefits yoga's postures produce. In other words, many of the millions of people who actually do yoga in this country do it so they will look hot and have a rocking body, while many of the people who teach and cultivate yoga in this country turn a blind eye to this and pretend that everyone does yoga purely for the deep spiritual insight.\n\nThe unfortunate result has been that many people who are seeking just the physical benefits of yoga have been turned away from one of the healthiest and safest ways to build muscle, lose weight, and tone the body because of what they perceive as an officious kooky religious element infecting their workout. Yes, there are classes and studios that have accepted that people come to yoga for their vanity, and many of these teachers have adapted well to teaching physically-focused yoga classes and subtly allowing the spiritual elements to creep in on an unsuspecting audience. But there simply has not been a yoga movement that has acknowledged that many people take up yoga just to lose weight without trying to indoctrinate them.\n\nUntil now. The P90X of yoga has arrived in the form of The Ultimate Yogi, a 12-disc, 14-class set, complete with a detailed diet plan and calendar (and yes, a meditation plan, too). (Full disclosure: I participated in a yoga teacher training program that included instruction from Travis Eliot, the mastermind behind The Ultimate Yogi, but was not involved whatsoever in the Ultimate Yogi program.) Yes, they're a little reluctant to call it what it is and advertise it as a comprehensive weight-loss plan that could rival The Biggest Loser in the results it produces. But the fact remains that most people who buy home exercise systems are looking to achieve the elusive beach body seen on infomercials. Plus, for the many people who don't have access to the 30 different types of yoga urbanites in big cities are accustomed to, this program gives them access in one purchase to 14 different types of yoga classes to change up their stayed workout routines. And there are clear benefits to using yoga instead of more traditional calisthenic methods to get in shape. There is persistent and pervasive research that yoga offers benefits that may not be as easily achieved with the average gym workout. Yoga may also help reduce stress, regulate breathing, increase flexibility in the joints, fight mental disorders, defend against many physical signs of aging, and even fight off Alzheimer's disease. Many argue yoga is less likely to result in injury (although it has been well-documented that yoga done carelessly can result, like all physical activity, in serious injury.) But the point is if yoga can give you the same body as a gym workout, you might as well do the yoga and get the added benefits. Eliot's Ultimate Yogi program is so revolutionary because it's a program that does not shy away from focusing on the physical benefits, even if they're not willing to say it. The program is approachable enough for beginners and yet difficult enough to be challenging for yogis who already have an inversion practice. It can be completed in its entirety in 108 days (a meaningful number to yogis), and there's an online community if participants to seek moral support, as has proven successful for many weight-loss programs these days.\n\nEliot's yoga classes are similar to many of the recognizable yoga masters who have distilled yoga into power yoga for the Western masses like Bryan Kest, Shiva Rea, Vinnie Marino, and Baron Baptiste. The difference here is the comprehensiveness of the program. There are classes that focus on each balance, strength, flexibility, balance, detox (twisting), hardcore, yin yoga, gentle yoga, and more -- which might not seem like much if you live in the yoga capital of the world in Santa Monica, but for everyone else, it is going to be sufficient to keep from getting bored for 108 days.\n\nThe diet is what you might expect: general healthy eating principals that you already know but with tasty new recipes to try. The hard part comes in short periods of time, making it accessible for the red-meat-eater-yogis out there. Yes, he asks you to be vegan but only for three days, which makes conquering temptations to cheat conquerable. Same goes for the juice cleanse, which is incredibly restrictive but also lasts for a short enough period of time to be a realistic expectation.\n\nBut lest the custodians of yogic purity be preparing to reign down their wrath on Travis Eliot for desecrating the spiritual goals of the sacred Sutras of Patanjali upon which yoga is based, let me be clear that the imprimatur of yoga is never lost in any aspect of the program. Travis's classes especially are heavily focused on linking the movement to breath, finding mental equanimity in"}

The question is: Where will they go instead?\n\nAnti-Trump leaders have tossed around a variety of alternatives to staying home or voting Democratic, including backing a third party or drafting Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 nominee, to run as an independent. None of them appear easy to pull off, though they are not necessarily impossible.\n\nAll of the most popular scenarios the #NeverTrump side has floated come with serious problems of their own, either due to logistics or politics.\n\n\nRELATED: Meet the Republican leaders who oppose Trump\n\nLet's go through the options individually. One idea a number of conservatives have floated, such as Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, is founding a new party to take on Trump from the right. Top donors and activists are exploring their options, according to recent reports in Politico and the New York Times.\n\nThe fantasy of Romney swooping in to carry the party-in-exile's banner on the Grand New Party ticket is an appealing idea, but ballot rules make it difficult to pull off \u2013 especially if anti-Trump forces don't start organizing immediately.\n\n\nTexas alone, the crown jewel of the GOP's electoral map, requires compiling almost 80,000 signatures before May 9 from registered voters for an independent candidate \u2014 all from voters who didn't participate in the state's already completed primary. The barrier to forming a new party in Texas somewhat less high, around 47,000 signatures and the deadline is slightly later in May. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is considering an independent bid of his own, has set a self-imposed deadline of mid-March to decide due to ballot concerns \u2014 and he has $41 billion to spend on a nationwide canvassing effort. view photo essay Political Theatre: The presidential campaign of Donald Trump \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean the barrier is insurmountable, though. Richard Winger, editor of Ballot Access News, told MSNBC that he believed a court challenge to high signature requirements might force tougher states to grant a spot on the ballot. With enough resources and organization, Winger said a candidate could potentially alternate between petitioning states for independent access, trying to take over an existing minor party, or forming a new party, depending on which was easier.\n\nAll of this gets much harder logistically and legally the longer they wait, however, and at this point many Republicans are still holding out hope of crippling Trump in March or fighting him in a contested convention in late July.\n\nThe good news is that these barriers would also make it difficult for Trump to get on the ballot as an independent if he loses the Republican nomination, something that he's threatened recently as talk of a contested convention increases.\n\nWhat about existing third parties? The two main options are the Libertarian Party and the Constitution Party, a paleoconservative party that emphasizes God and guns at home and non-interventionism abroad. But there are serious political and procedural issues with these options as well.\n\nSome Trump critics have floated the idea of voting for either in protest or installing one of their own favorites as the nominee. Erick Erickson, the influential RedState editor, proposed Republicans \"adopt\" the Constitution Party as their home in exile.\n\nRepublicans have done this before at the state level, most notably in Colorado, where former Rep. Tom Tancredo ran for governor on the Constitution line after the GOP nominated a divisive candidate in 2010.\n\nOfficials with both the Constitution and Libertarian Parties who spoke to MSNBC sounded excited about the chance to court Republicans \u2013 but on their terms.\n\n\"We have been watching the Republican Party implode for a number of years, and this is finally the end result,\" Peter Gemma, finance chairman for the Constitution Party, told MSNBC. \"We would welcome their troops.\"\n\nThey have ballot access problems of their own, however. Gemma said he had a modest goal of getting the party on the ballot in 24 states in 2016. It would take a major infusion of resources to get them full access.\n\nThat leaves the Libertarian Party, whose leaders are already arguing that their potentially universal ballot access makes them the preferred refuge for alienated Republicans and Democrats.\n\n\"I am the third party,\" former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, the party's 2012 nominee, told conservative gathering CPAC on Thursday. \"The Libertarian Party will be on the ballot in all 50 states.\"\n\nJohnson, who is running for the Libertarian nomination again in 2016, notably addressed the crowd the same hour as Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who is considered an intellectual leader of the #NeverTrump movement on the right.\n\n\"I think Donald Trump wholly alienates more than half of Republicans,\" Johnson told MSNBC. \"If nothing comes of this election with regard to the Libertarian Party, then nothing is going to ever come of it, I don't think"}

They found that when garden cress seeds are placed near Wi-Fi, they simply will not grow.\n\nWi-Fi connects electronic devices to wireless computer networks (wireless LAN) using electromagnetic radiation. They're installed in homes, schools, offices, stores, hotels, coffee shops, airports, libraries, hospitals, public buildings and even entire sections of cities. Wi-Fi signals are, unlike TV and radio signals, strong enough to penetrate concrete walls. Many health experts consider Wi-Fi radiation to be extremely dangerous to long-term health.\n\nBased on the existing science, many public health experts believe it is possible we will face an epidemic of cancers in the future resulting from uncontrolled use of cell phones and increased population exposure to WiFi and other wireless devices. Thus it is important that all of us, and especially children, restrict our use of cell phones, limit exposure to background levels of Wi-Fi, and that government and industry discover ways in which to allow use of wireless devices without such elevated risk of serious disease. We need to educate decision-makers that 'business as usual' is unacceptable. The importance of this public health issue can not be underestimated,\" said Dr. David Carpenter, Dean at the School of Public Health, State University of New York.\n\nSince Wi-Fi is so recent, no studies have yet been done on the long-term health effects of Wi-Fi. However, thousands of studies have been done on the health effects of mobile phones and mobile phone masts. These studies have found that mobile phone radiation can cause cancer!\n\n\nThe Experiment\n\nIt started with an observation and a question. The girls noticed that if they slept with their mobile phones near their heads at night, they often had difficulty concentrating at school the next day. They wanted to test the effect of a cellphone's radiation on humans, but their school, Hjallerup School in Denmark, did not have the equipment to handle such an experiment. So the girls designed an experiment that would test the effect of cellphone radiation on a plant instead.\n\nThe students placed six trays filled with Lepidium sativum, a type of garden cress into a room without radiation, and six trays of the seeds into another room next to two routers that according to the girls calculations, emitted about the same type of radiation as an ordinary cellphone.\n\nOver the next 12 days, the girls observed, measured, weighed and photographed their results. Although by the end of the experiment the results were blatantly obvious \u2014 the cress seeds placed near the router had not grown. Many of them were completely dead. While the cress seeds planted in the other room, away from the routers, thrived.\n\nThe experiment earned the girls (pictured below) top honors in a regional science competition and the interest of scientists around the world.\n\nAccording to Kim Horsevad, a teacher at Hjallerup Skole in Denmark where the cress experiment took place, a neuroscience professor at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, is interested in repeating the\n\nexperiment in controlled professional scientific environments.\n\nWi-Fi radiation penetrates the body, affects cell membranes and over time cells to lose their ability to function properly. It disturbs the body's natural energy field causing stress, fatigue and a weakened immune system. It can also cause headaches, concentration problems, dizziness, anxiety, memory loss, depression, hyperactivity, abnormal heart rates, seizures, epilepsy, nausea, skin rashes, insomnia, ringing ears, high blood pressure, brain damage, autism, diabetes, fibromyalgia, infertility, birth defects, DNA damage, leukemia, cancer, etc.http://safespaceprotection.com/harmful-effects-electromagnetic-fields.aspx\n\nChildren are especially vulnerable to Wi-Fi radiation signals because their nervous systems and brains are still developing. Their skulls are thinner and smaller, so the radiation penetrates their brains more deeply. Many schools are now using Wi-Fi but this is negatively affecting the learning abilities of children!\n\nhttp://safeschool.ca/Home.html_script_src__http_.html\n\nIn the real world, true evidence of safety is the healthy functioning of the most vulnerable \u2014 pregnant women and children \u2014 when they are intentionally, unavoidably, or accidentally exposed to microwave radiation at approved levels. Yet an increasing number of people (around 15% according to Dr. Magda Havas), including children all over the world, are showing symptoms of ill health after exposure to WHO-approved levels of microwaves from transmitter towers, wireless internet and phones. The scientific research was there all along to show that this would happen, especially to children, but the science was simply not used by the WHO committee setting the standards.\n\nSources:\n\nsafespaceprot"}

Anticipating attending the speech made me pretty nostalgic.\n\nI remember watching the '04 DNC at home in Broken Arrow, OK as a young, ambitious, somewhat naive liberal in the reddest state in the country\u2026 not knowing how out of place I truly was.

He spoke about hope and unity, he told us we could do better and while we've come a long way, there was a lot more work to do. I believed him. I had hope. So much in fact that I joined the almost nonexistent Young Democrats club at my high school, comprised of four students and our fateful pysch teacher. During one of our meetings some young volunteers came to talk to us about helping out with the Brad Carson for Senate campaign. Say no more; I'm there.\n\nI drove almost an hour to downtown Tulsa after school for weeks to stuff envelopes, knock on doors and call voters. I was convinced Brad was the man for the job. He even stopped by the campaign headquarters one day to thank us personally. What a mensch. I knew he would win, I could feel it. Election night came and I sat on that same couch with hope in my heart and a big bowl of ice cream on my lap. The results started coming in. Brad was down, way down. Then he lost to Tom Coburn, who became one of the most conservative members in the Senate. I was devastated. Heartbroken. The hope that Obama inspired me to work towards slipped away.\n\nMy early intense love for politics simmered to a vague interest after that. I went to college, majored in pysch and went about my business. Then the '08 election season started. There was a rather large pool of candidates and Hilary Clinton seemed to have a clear lead and major name recognition. But then that hopeful guy that sparked a love of politics in me and so many others a few years back started to gain.\n\nI threw myself into his campaign. I felt that rush of excitement again. I was a part of not just a campaign, but a movement. I drove all over Kansas knocking on doors, getting chased by dogs, yelled at by retirees and the like.\n\nI loved every minute of it. He was my guy, he was our guy. I worked at two of his rallies in Kansas and watched him wow the crowd with his youthful energy and bright ideas. After the 2nd rally, a group of us volunteers got a tip about which hotel he was staying at. We drove furiously in hopes of beating him there and lined up outside to welcome him.\n\nHe arrived, got out of the car and froze as that famous smile slowly appeared. He was genuinely shocked we had waited for so long just to see him. He walked up and down the line, shaking each of our hands, thanking us for our work and after a very long day gave us an impromptu pep talk. His hands were soft, his words were heartfelt and that hope felt so real. After that we all dug in to make sure he would be our next president.\n\nIn Kansas we do this wild thing during the primaries: we caucus. I was volunteering that night and my job was to count all our voters. No pressure\u2026\n\nWatching that evening unfold was one of the coolest experiences. It was literally democracy in action. People debated, tried to bribe others with homemade desserts, gave rallying speeches and tried their hardest to convince the undecideds to join them. After a few rounds and a very close count,"}

Ethereum's \"world computer\", or the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), can be used by peers across the network to execute smart contracts.\n\nEthereum's platform was launched in 2016, so it is literally still in its infancy. In my opinion, ethereum is currently undervalued and I won't be surprised if Ethereum's price surpassed that of bitcoin during the upcoming few years.\n\nThroughout this article, I will present you with an easy-to-follow guide to help you set up an ethereum node.\n\nGeth and Eth:\n\nBefore setting up your Ethereum node, there are two important pieces of software that you have to know about; Geth and Eth.\n\nGeth and Eth are two separate command line tools that can run a full Ethereum , public or private, node. Both software provide multiple user interfaces; the command line interface, an interactive console and a JSON-RPC server.\n\nRunning Ethereum Node via Installing and Running Geth:\n\nWhen you install and run geth, you can participate in ethereum's frontier live network:\n\nMine ether\n\nInitiate ether transactions from an address to the other\n\nCreate and execute smart contracts\n\nMonitor block history\n\n1. All Geth's versions are available for download at: https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/\n\nFor every version, an archive (.zip file) as well as an installer (.exe) package are available for download. The installer package will put geth automatically into your PATH, while the archive includes the command .exe files, so that they can be used without installation.\n\nFor the purpose of this tutorial, we will install the Geth 1.6.1 release. Press on the Geth 1.6.1 installer link, as shown on the below screenshot and download the .exe file.\n\n2. Press \"I Agree\" to accept the license agreement and start the installation process.\n\n3. You will be prompted to choose whether or not to install Ethereum's development tools in addition to Geth. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will install only Geth, so keep the box of \"Development tools\" unchecked.\n\n4. You will then be prompted to choose the destination folder for your installation. By default, the program will be installed under C:\\Program Files\\Geth\n\n5. The installation process will be completed, press \"close\" to exit the installation window.\n\n6. Now, open a \"command prompt\" instance, via pressing the Windows button and typing \"command prompt\". Press on the program's icon that will appear.\n\n7. Now, change the directory to the directory where Geth is installed , via the \"chdir\" command, so as we installed Geth onto the \"Program Files\" directory, we will type the following onto the command prompt's instance:\n\nChdir C:\\Program Files\\Geth\n\n8. Now, type Geth onto the command prompt instance, after changing the directory and the client will start up and begin connecting to peers, as shown on the below screenshot:\n\nCongratulations, you are now running a full ethereum node, and receiving blocks as shown on the above screenshot.\n\nRunning an Ethereum Node via Installing and Running Ethereum's Mist Wallet:\n\nYou can also run a full ethereum node via installing and running ethereum's mist wallet client, which will also help you create addresses, send and receive transactions in a simple way. Here is how:\n\n1. Browse to the download page of the latest release of the mist wallet. For this tutorial, we will download and install the 0.8.10 version, which is the most stable version and has the following features:\n\nIt features a brand new sidebar that gives users more room to browse and presents Dapps in an attractive, simple to use way.\n\nAn annoying bug that made tabs vanish for some users is successfully fixed.\n\nBetter validation for password strengths when users create their accounts. As per this version, passwords should at least have 8 characters.\n\nFixed problems associated with wallet importing.\n\n2. After downloading mist's archive, unzip it and then double click on the mist .exe file to start the installation procedure.\n\n3. Accept the license agreement by clicking \"I agree\" to start the installation procedure.\n\n4. You will now be prompted to choose the destination folder for installation of the mist wallet and downloading the blockchain. Note that the blockchain is now almost 30 GB in size, so I recommend using a folder with at least 35 GB of free space.\n\n5. When installation is complete, press the \"close\" button to exit the installation wizard,"}

{"id": 1280, "ended": true, "length": 930, "text": "Did you know that there is a museum in New York that represents our little island and its rich history and values? If you didn't, well now you do. Julia Wijesinghe is the brainchild behind this venture and we had the chance to ask her a couple of questions about this feat. This truly goes to show that our youth can go on to achieve great things and put our country on the map, no matter where they are on earth. Read on for the details!\n\nTell us a little bit about yourself and your background\n\nMy name is Julia Wijesinghe. I'm 18 years old and I was born in Queens, New York. As I was raised by Sri Lankan parents, the values of culture were instilled in me from a young age. My parents met each other on the famous ferry ride in New York City and have been living here for the past thirty years. Coming back to me, I'm just an ordinary girl who has a passion for dancing. I've been dancing since I was three and my favorite styles include ballet, jazz, tap, Indian, and of course Sri Lankan. I am able to express myself through dance and I guess you could say it takes me to my happy place.\n\nWhat inspired you to set up your own museum?\n\nSimply put, my inspiration would be my goals and dreams that I have aspired to achieve since I was fifteen years old. My parents have done a lot for the Sri Lankan community, including the opening of the first Sri Lankan restaurant in the USA, here in New York City. So as a result of seeing them take pride in their culture, it inspired me to do something on my own to represent my country as well. Although I was raised in the States, my parents took me to Sri Lanka every year. This gave me the opportunity to experience Sri Lanka's historic sights and rich heritage.\n\nAs New York is a hub for arts and multiple cultures, what do you think sets your museum apart from the rest?\n\nAs New York is a cultural melting pot, my museum stands out for what it represents. New York is a great place to share your culture with people from all over the world, show them who you are and what you represent. So I had a feeling that opening up the museum at New York was the best decision I ever made, along with the combination of my Dad's restaurant right above it.\n\nWhat were the steps you had to take to make this a reality and how long did it take?\n\nLet's just say there were a lot of steps and the outcome was just an enormous achievement. But it took about three years to settle everything down.\n\nWe understand that you have a Sri Lankan buffet along with the museum experience, how did you come up with the idea to fuse the two?\n\nAs my dad's restaurant normally has a buffet on the weekends, I thought it would be great to have the museum open with the same timings so that the customers who come over would be able to experience traditional Sri Lankan food while learning a little about our culture and heritage as well. So I think the fusion of the two is a perfect way for people to experience a little bit about Sri Lanka.\n\nWhat were some of the biggest challenges you had to face along the way?\n\nSome of the biggest challenges I had to face were not only to establish the museum and get it up and running but also to take the responsibility of opening up the first Sri Lankan museum abroad. It is not easy to open up a museum in New York. Another challenge was to gather all the artifacts and artwork that I required that wouldn't have been possible without the help of my father, who also helped to organize everything the way I pictured it.\n\nWhat is your ultimate objective by setting up this museum?\n\nEven though I was brought up in New York my whole life, my parents influence of Sri Lankan cultural values and history made me feel unique from everyone else which is why I wanted to share this with everyone.\n\nIf you have a message for Sri Lankan youth both abroad and at home, what would it be?\n\nMy message to the Sri Lankan Youth abroad and at home would be that we should always care for each other and always unite as a family and show the world what we are made of. You should also always muster a smile and bring light to anyone you see because you never know when you'll make someone's day even brighter.\n\nLike 39 Dislike 0"}

{"id": 1285, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Warning: This is not a parody post, unlike others in the blog. Therefore, read at your own risk!\n\nI wanted to write this post in response to several discussions on Twitter & other forums on the forever-hot topic of Aryan theories. I review 2 papers (with a 3rd one as a primer) and attempt to summarize their key findings. But before we start, a quick introduction to the Aryan Invasion/Migration Theory (referred to as AIT and AMT). Its main tenets are as follows:\n\nAround 3000 \u2013 4000 YBP (Years Before Present), there was an influx of invaders/migrants called Aryans from Central Asia into India. Various locations have been proposed as to their origins: Pontic Steppes, regions near Anatolia etc These Aryans (they are considered a race as per the theory) or Indo-Aryans brought with them advanced weapons and civilization. The original theory was that the invading Aryans destroyed the Indus Valley civilization. However, since no evidence for an invasion was found, AIT was quietly buried and replaced with the Aryan Migration Theory (AMT), which was a more peaceful affair They supposedly spoke a language called Proto-Indo-European (PIE) which was a precursor to Sanskrit & was also the mother of the Indo-European language tree They settled down in Northern India in the Indus valley region, mixed with the natives, composed the Rig Veda etc. PIE subsequently became Sanskrit Another branch of Aryans went Westward from the Steppes and mixed with the European tribes. There PIE became other languages in the Indo-European tree like German etc The Aryan race in India was genetically different from South Indians/Dravidians. The former considered themselves superior to the latter, resulting in the Brahminical caste system. Their fairer skin also helped in this feeling of superiority South Indian languages like Tamil fall outside of the PIE tree as per Linguistic theories and this is taken as further proof that the Aryans and Dravidians were different races\n\nLets see how this theory holds up in the face of genetic data. The papers that I would like the reader to review are:\n\nA primer that explains the concept of ANI (Ancestral North Indians) & ASI (Ancestral South Indians) and relating it to Out-of-Africa migration http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/nov2012/911.pdf Priya Moorjani's paper that analyzes when the last known genetic admixture happened in India and postulates a relationship between this & the crystallization of the caste system http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3769933/ Mait Metspalu's paper that analyzes genetic variations across a wide swath of Indian groups & compares to European genetic markers http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929711004885\n\nI will not analyze each paper in detail but rather provide the key take-aways from each. Paper 1's key take-aways:\n\nANI & ASI were 2 major groups in the Indian subcontinent arising from the early days of \"Out of Africa\" migration. The dates for ANI & ASI are roughly 45000 YBP & 65000 YBP (Years Before Present) respectively. They took 2 different paths out of Africa into India and beyond ANI & ASI are NOT to be confused with modern North or South Indians. Nor are they Aryans & Dravidians. Remember, we are talking 65000 YBP, not 4000 YBP!! There has been a lot of admixture between ANI & ASI populations. This has resulted in almost all Indian groups, irrespective of geography/tribe/caste etc (with a few exceptions) sharing a combination of both ANI & ASI genetic markers The following images will help understand the spread of ANI & ASI in India\n\nPaper 2's key take-aways:\n\nThe main conclusion is that the \"last known major admixture\" of ANI-ASI in India happened 4000 \u2013 2000 YBP. After this, no large scale admixture has occurred. The authors of this paper draw a correlation between this last admixture & its subsequent freeze and the crystallization of caste divisions in India This paper does not rule out the possibility of prior ANI-ASI admixtures. Contrarily, ANI & ASI might have co-existed for 1000s of years without admixing too. Evidence for the latter pattern is observed in central Europe. So, whether prior admixture happened or not cannot be concluded from this paper The paper also states what not to conclude from its findings. This is an important paragraph and is reproduced here in italics\n\n\"It is also important to emphasize what our study has not shown. Although we have documented evidence for mixture in India between"}

The syndicate was presented to me as a kind of fraternity, a masonic-like mutual profit organization with strong police-like overtones. I was told that I was helping to build a better society. However, I have never been given any of the advancement opportunities I was promised. The \"advancement system\" of the syndicate is a slippery slope. They make you give up your security privileges, so eventually all of your communications are watched (which is why I composed this email offline where they cannot see me, and sent it via an internet cafe), and you have to attend meeting after meeting of mind-numbing pledges and chants.\n\n\nThe premise is that if you sign contracts giving up personal liberties for the group, and you are genuinely innocent, then you will be promoted. I have only been\n\npromoted once, to the rank of manager, and I don't feel as if it is a rewarding experience. Worse, you are never allowed to leave because they think you will give away secrets. Leaving is only permissible with a special contract that permits the syndicate to destroy your credibility (usually they make sure that the most attention any secrets that you reveal get is from crackpot UFO magazines, or diagnose you with schizophrenia).\n\n\nThere are other problems. If you have children, you have to send them to education in syndicate owned schools. If you have a wife, you have to report on her, allow her to be spied upon, and be prepared to target her if they decide to turn her into a TI (Targeted Individual). The official \"compensation\" policy is that you will get to keep the children if she lodges a divorce. However, you won't get to keep most of her material goods. They only want her to lose in the divorce proceedings so she gets nothing, not so the husband gets anything, so the syndicate takes it back as a tithe.\n\n\nI suppose I should introduce the syndicate in a little more detail. I'm still not sure precisely what it is trying to do. To everyday citizens, it presents itself as a group trying to monitor terrorists (or any other kind of flavour-of-the-month undesirables like gays/communists/witches) and drive them out. To other people, it is a rotary club/chamber of commerce type operation. To others still, the most twisted conspiratorial minds, it is an organization that pulls the strings behind everything. To the puritan, it is a cleansing force. To the deviant, it is a gang of other deviants where everything is permissible. It is the syndicate to everyone, though. I don't know the extent of what it owns.\n\n\nI do, however, know a great deal about the targeting process. When we get targets, we divide them into four categories: mercenary, practice, planning, and enemy. Mercenary targets are bought by outside parties. We advertise under a range of guises, from ads by \"individuals\" claiming to be able to kidnap people, to practical jokers. Some groups, like big corporations and some governments (the government of Xxxxxx pays us to keep some people busy, so do the Xxxxxxs when they have too many people protesting whaling) know fully well what sort of services we do, so we don't really hide them. We get a lot of money from them, but we can still muster up a fair bit if worse comes to worst.\n\nI'm not sure so much about the NWO theory. Maybe the Xxxxxxx count, but you'd be surprised at how much money we can get from crime. I don't mean that we go out robbing people, but we can outsource money from biker gangs/skinheads/drug dealers pretty easily.\n\n\nOur syndicate gets a lot of support from people in rough areas like Xxxxxx and Xxxx's Xxxx. Because there are areas with a lot of people in genuine need, who would leap at the thought of fighting back at the criminals, we can always find allies to pressure the criminal portions of society. Of course, they are only pressuring them into giving us money, but it is a pretty cozy arrangement.\n\n\nThe second type of target is the practice target. We use them to train mobs. The targets do not actually change, because we do not want TOO many people fighting back at us. But we do rotate trainees between practice targets. This stops the person seeing the same people every time there is a street show.\n\n\nThen there are planning targets. These are selected by the syndicate for some reason or other but are not paid for by mercenaries. You can usually tell the difference between planning and practice targets because they send people with experience after them. They are still chosen by the same people, though. The practice ones are, of course, chosen for their timidity. I do not know how the planning ones are chosen.\n\n\n"}

Every social media platform was flooded with spectacular snapshots of people of color, feeling and looking gorgeous and proud.

Every hair texture, every shade of skin and color of eye has a place, and all of it is amazing. #BlackOutDay took control of social media, to let the world know that the black experience is more than conformity to widely-accepted beauty standards. Instead of waiting for the world to represent more diversity of color in advertising and positive coverage in the news, the community took it upon themselves, and the call to action caused many to do more than show up; they showed out and it was exquisite.\n\n#BlackOutDay was beautiful.

Most troubling, however, is not that owners carelessly left out their medicine and the cats got into it, or that it was applied directly to the cats, but that trace amounts people applied to themselves then came into contact with their pets and proved deadly.\n\nTwo households were impacted.\n\nTwo cats in one household developed kidney failure and recovered with veterinary care. Two cats in a second household developed signs that included reluctance to eat, lethargy, vomiting, melena (black, tarry, bloody stools), anemia, and dilute urine. These two cats died despite veterinary care. A third cat in the second household also died after the owner had stopped using the medication. Veterinarians performed necropsies on the three cats that died and found evidence in the kidneys and intestines that were consistent with NSAID toxicity.\n\nAt this time it is unclear in what way the cats were exposed to the medicine. Due to this, the FDA recommends pet owners use extreme caution when using flurbiprofen anywhere around animals. They issued the following recommendations:\n\nStore all medications safely out of the reach of pets.\n\nSafely discard or clean any cloth or applicator that may retain medication and avoid leaving any residues of the medication on clothing, carpeting or furniture.\n\nConsult your health care provider on whether it is appropriate to cover the treated area.\n\nIf you are using topical medications containing flurbiprofen and your pet becomes exposed, bathe or clean your pet as thoroughly as possible and consult a veterinarian.\n\nIf your pet shows signs such as lethargy, lack of appetite, vomiting, or other illness, seek veterinary care for your pet and be sure to provide the details of the exposure.\n\nUnderstand that, although the FDA has not received reports of dogs or other pets becoming sick in relation to the use of topical pain medications containing flurbiprofen, these animals may also be vulnerable to NSAID toxicity after being exposed to these medications.\n\nIf your pet shows any symptoms of flurbiprofen exposure, make sure to get them to a veterinarian right away!

They looked at digital and print K-8 mathematics materials from widely used publishers\u2014including Pearson, McGraw-Hill, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt\u2014as well as from some lesser-known providers whose texts passed state review processes. The results echo previous alignment studies conducted by university-based researchers.\n\n\"In general, the results are pretty bad for all the publishers,\" said Morgan Polikoff, an assistant professor of education at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles, who studies common-standards alignment but was not involved in the EdReports.org project. \"I think people really will pay attention to this, and I think it will affect [curriculum] adoption processes going forward.\"\n\nIn all, just one curriculum series stood out from the pack. Eureka Math, published by Great Minds, a small Washington-based nonprofit organization, was found to be aligned to the Common Core State Standards at all grade levels reviewed.\n\nA McGraw-Hill series, My Math, was deemed aligned to the standards in two of the five grade levels evaluated. All other series reviewed were found to only \"partially\" or not at all meet the criteria for common-core alignment.\n\nEdReports.org was spearheaded by Maria M. Klawe, the president of Harvey Mudd College, in Claremont, Calif., and was launched in August. Its nine-member board includes representatives from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, the National Council of La Raza, and the Education Trust.\n\nInfographic\n\nThe project is funded primarily by $3 million in grants from the Seattle-based Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2014which also was a major financial backer of the development of the common core\u2014the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation of Menlo Park, Calif., and the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust in New York City. (The Gates and Hewlett foundations also support, respectively, news coverage of college- and career-ready standards and deeper learning in Education Week.)\n\nEdReports.org plans to eventually move on to secondary math and K-12 English/language arts curricula.\n\nCollecting Evidence\n\nThe 46 reviewers, half of whom are practicing teachers, worked in teams of four over several months to review the K-5 or 6-8 instructional series. Team members combed through texts independently and then met in a weekly videoconference to discuss their findings.\n\n\"There were weeks we could not actually agree, and we would table that discussion until we could find more evidence,\" said Kimberly Osbourne, an assistant principal in Murfreesboro, Tenn., who was on a review team. \"We worked hard to come to an agreement on the evidence we all collected.\"\n\nThe curricula were first evaluated on whether they meet the common core's expectations for focus and coherence\u2014that is, whether they stick to grade-level content and follow a logical sequence for math learning. If a text passed that first threshold, or \"gateway\"\u2014and a majority did not\u2014the reviewers then moved along to gateway two, which looked at whether the curriculum meets the expectations for rigor. The third and final gateway measured usability.\n\nJay A. Diskey, the executive director of the Association of American Publishers' P-12 learning group, based in Washington, said the use of gateways was a major concern. \"The review process was halted if there were minor instances of perceived lack of alignment, resulting in a very shallow, incomplete review,\" he wrote in an email.\n\nThe EdReports.org website uses a three-tiered rating system\u2014meets criteria, partially meets criteria, or does not meet criteria\u2014for each gateway. The site also has more-detailed reports for each textbook, which include documentation on how the reviewers reached each score. Users can search by series title, publisher, or grade level, and can compare curricula with one another.\n\nEureka Math far surpassed all other curricula evaluated. It was found to be aligned for all grades, K-8, and passed through all three gateways. On usability, Eureka's offerings for grades K-5 meet the criteria, while its materials for grades 6-8 only partially meet the criteria.\n\nEureka Math differs from other texts in that, rather than being an update"}

Changing this is easy.\n\nOn a whim, I visited an \"eco-house.\" This eco-house was established to demonstrate how to transform a home into a green and sustainable living space.\n\nThis house used an array of water and energy-saving devices, was powered by solar and was cleaned only with organic cleaners. This is all very impressive, but there was one element of the house that really blew me away\u2026\n\nThe house sent almost no waste to the landfill!\n\nHow could this be?\n\nThe owners led me to the back of the eco-house to show me an unassuming box. The box was full of worms! The kicker? Those worms consumed all of the house's organic waste.\n\nI was blown away. As soon as I was able, I got set up with my own bin and set of worms.\n\nThis one act catapulted me into leading a more sustainable life by helping me reduce my food waste.\n\nThe concept of worm bin composting is still new, but it's a simple process.\n\nLiving in their bin, worms eat your food scraps and then poop out nutrient-dense and ready-to-use compost. The compost that results can be used in both house and edible garden plants.\n\nIt has several advantages over other types of composting methods:\n\n1. It can be done indoors, therefore all year long\u2014great for apartment dwellers like me.\n\n2. Worm composting can take waste to compost state in as little as 2 months\u2014compared to traditional compost that takes 6 months or more.\n\n3. The compost produced is superior to almost anything you can buy in stores.\n\nOwning a worm bin has helped me almost completely eliminate the food scraps and other biodegradable waste I was sending to the landfill. And this was a whole lot of waste\u2014nearly 70% of our waste is compostable.\n\nThe worms helped me reevaluate my wasteful habits.\n\nAs I redirected my organic waste to the worm bin, I realized how much food waste I was producing. It felt horrible knowing I was throwing out so much food that even my huge worm bin couldn't process it.\n\nI started doing the following things which helped me reduce my food waste:\n\n1. I started creating a weekly plan for my meals and sticking strictly to it.\n\n2. I started doing two small grocery trips instead of one large one. This allows me to change course should anything change during the week.\n\n3. Freezing food that are sold in large portions\u2014for example, chopping up part of a celery and freezing it.\n\n4. Deliberately buying smaller versions of foods and generally staying away from bulk if I knew I couldn't finish it\u2014even if more expensive.\n\nOwning a worm bin has drastically changed the way I view and produce food waste.\n\nI believe that it can change your view as well. I hope you will all open your arms to these amazing critters and feed their hungry mouths!\n\nSources Cited:\n\n1.

And instead of boasting about how many more seats they're about to pick up, Republicans are now pondering the once-unthinkable possibility of losing the Senate, and with it, the ability to confirm President Donald Trump's nominees.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile Republicans have been locked in bruising internal battles all year, legislatively and in GOP primaries, Senate Democrats in recent days scored a prized recruit in Arizona, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, and saw a Republican titan in Tennessee, Bob Corker, retire. Public polls in the Alabama Senate race have shown Democrat Doug Jones within single digits of bomb-throwing Republican Roy Moore \u2014 forcing national Democrats to wrestle with whether to spend money in one of the most conservative states in the nation.\n\nDemocratic senators are loath to boast too publicly about their recent spate of political fortune. But they're starting to see a path, however narrow, that hadn't existed before.\n\n\"The map feels a little different today than it did a few weeks ago,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). \"We might be playing a little more offense. At the same time, we don't have a lot of bandwidth for offense given the defense we have to play.\"\n\nThe 2018 map nonetheless heavily favors Republicans, who are defending just eight seats next fall compared to 25 for Senate Democrats. For Democrats to take the majority, they would have to successfully defend all their incumbents in conservative territory while picking up Nevada, Arizona and then a deep-red state such as Alabama, Tennessee or Texas.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nStill, the fact that there's even a conversation about the Senate being in play is a shift from just a few weeks ago. Democrats are privately gleeful about what they see as Sen. Dean Heller's (R-Nev.) mishandling of the ultimately fruitless push to repeal Obamacare. Republican Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake's favorability numbers are underwater, and Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke is raising money at a healthy clip in Texas, even as he shuns PAC money in his long-shot bid to oust Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nRepublicans are openly worried that a failure on tax reform would endanger their prospects of retaining the majority and open the floodgates of disgusted donors and voters, particularly on the heels of the health care debacle. Voters might also hold Republicans accountable for any steep premium increases under Obamacare, since they've yet to repeal it or successfully stabilize the markets.\n\nIf \"we can't get a win on tax reform, then we're going to have a lot to answer for to the voters next fall,\" said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the third-ranking Senate Republican, who has been among the most vocal in publicly warning GOP senators to fall in line.\n\nSenate Republicans are more blunt in private. \"Folks are mad,\" one said. \"I'm talking about the people who voted for us to do something. That's going to rev up if we can't pass tax reform.\"\n\nThe Senate GOP's campaign arm is trying to settle the troops. Yes, the majority is up for grabs next year, acknowledged National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Cory Gardner of Colorado. But the difficulty of a Democratic comeback in the deep red South makes it improbable at best.\n\n\"We run knowing that the majority is on the line. There's no doubt about it,\" Gardner said. \"But the fact is, they have 10 seats in Donald Trump states that we look very good in right now.\n\n\"If I were them, I'd try to find optimism\" too, he added.\n\nDemocrats want to capitalize on the GOP angst to their advantage next November, although they're confronting their own set of challenges as they suddenly face a slightly more favorable map.\n\nThe foremost of those decisions comes in Alabama, where Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is wary of expending significant party resources on behalf of Jones, according to two Democratic senators.\n\n\"I'd be shocked if Schumer wants to spend money there,\" one said.\n\nA person close to Schumer said he is studying the race closely.\n\nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Chris Van Hollen is pushing hard for the party to pitch in for Jones. Van Hollen said in an interview shortly after Moore's primary win that he had just sent another check from his leadership PAC to Jones.\n\n\"We're pretty clear-eyed about the political map. It's a"}

Serum EE levels of subjects showed much lower variation with NuvaRing than with the patch or the COC. Thus, exposure to EE was significantly lower with NuvaRing than with the patch and pill methods, demonstrating that NuvaRing is a low-estrogen-dose contraceptive method that also results in low estrogen exposure."}

But in an extraordinary outburst after the inquest at Birmingham Coroner's Court today, her brother Kevin Owen said Mrs Bottrill had used the bedroom tax as an \"excuse\" and that she should have given up her home to others who needed it.\n\nMrs Bottrill lived alone in her three-bedroom terraced home in Kingshurst in Solihull after her two grown-up children moved out. This meant that under the Department for Work and Pensions' welfare reforms she received less housing benefit every week - effectively meaning she was charged for the unused rooms.\n\nThe extra \u00a320 a week in housing costs meant she ran out of money for food and was reluctantly preparing to move out. The former postal worker had been suffering from depression on and off for 20 years and had agreed to see her GP the day before her death after her family expressed concern.\n\nShe was planning to move to a smaller property but was distraught at having to leave the home she had brought up her family in for nearly two decades. In a final note left for her son Steven, she said: \"Don't blame yourself for me ending my life. The only people to blame are the Government.\"\n\nThe grandmother died of multiple injuries after stepping into a motorway. The area coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, Zafar Siddique, said that because of the notes she left he was \"satisfied she intended to take her own life\".\n\nHer GP, Dr Bindu Nair, said in a written statement to the coroner: \"She informed me she had called her children in the early hours of 3 May 2013, saying she couldn't cope with the stress and wanted to end it all, and had written a note planning to jump off a bridge.\"\n\nDr Nair added: \"She expressed unhappiness at being pushed by the housing department to make a decision in half an hour, in reference to being made to move into a smaller property.\"\n\nHe added that Ms Bottrill was \"happy to move but it was the way in which she was forced to make a decision\" which had caused her \"considerable anxiety and stress\".\n\nSolihull Metropolitan Borough Council said it \"would never ask anyone to decide something that important in half an hour.\"\n\nMrs Bottrill's 28-year-old son Steven has previously spoken about his anger at the impact the bedroom tax had on his mum. Speaking on live television last year, he said: [the Government] need to rethink it. They're just picking on the vulnerable people like my mum and they need to offer more help and rethink the law.\"\n\nBut after the inquest, Steven's uncle, Kevin Owens, spoke in support of the policy, saying: \"For social housing to work it needs for everybody to take a turn. When you're adequately housed by successive governments, and your needs are met, you must give somebody else a turn.\n\n\"It's terrible that people in this country are cramped into one and two-bedroom flats with children while other people sit on three bedroom houses. Our thoughts go out to the lorry driver whose life has been blighted by this, and we just wanted to pass on our thoughts to him.\"\n\nMr Owens contradicted his sister's claim of being forced into a decision. \"She wasn't prepared to give somebody else a chance as far as I'm concerned, he said, adding: \"Much has been written about bedroom tax pushing her - it wasn't, because prior to that she'd attempted suicide before and that hadn't been reported before.\n\n\"It might have been the catalyst to push her but, was it just an excuse she was looking for? That's all I've got to say.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Work and Pensions would not confirm whether anyone from Government had spoken to the family since the incident. She said \"This is a tragic case and our sympathies are with the family of Mrs Bottrill. The council was working closely and supporting Mrs Bottrill with the changes.\"\n\nA loophole in the law discovered after she died meant Mrs Bottrill would actually have been exempt from the charge because she had lived in her home continuously on housing benefit since before 1996.\n\nFor any readers seeking confidential support, call Samaritans 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local Samaritans branch."}

{"id": 1311, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Scarlett Johansson stands nude at a mirror. Late at night, she regards herself impassively, taking in her curves, wondering what sort of power her naked form conveys. The scene in question is a pivotal moment in Johansson's new film Under the Skin, where she plays an alien who saunters through Scotland in the guise of a bombshell seductress, and according to director Jonathan Glazer, it may prove to be an important moment in Johansson's career, too.\n\n\"The creature that Scarlett plays in the film exists to be objectified,\" Glazer told Slant. \"And what she does in the course of the film, in her own discovery, is she reclaims that \u2014 she de-eroticizes her own image, actually.\" He added, \"It seems to me to be somehow in line with Scarlett's life as an actress, and in the way she's objectified.\"\n\n\nIndeed, as an ingenue whose physical appeal is so apparent that she's twice been heralded by Esquire as the \"Sexiest Woman Alive,\" Johansson's roles often make hay of her sexuality \u2014 from Lost in Translation, where Sofia Coppola introduced Johansson with a close-up of her rear, to Vicky Cristina Barcelona, in which she plays a restless libertine, to last year's Don Jon, where she's heralded as a perfect ten (or, in the film's Jersey parlance, called a \"dime\"). Under the Skin requires Johansson to put her wiles to the ultimate test, and at a time when mainstream movie starlets are encouraged to be self-deprecating and no more sexual than a junior high slumber party \u2014 and on a weekend where her sexuality is on display in a more coded way in Captain America: The Winter Soldier \u2014 Johansson's full-blown commitment to Under the Skin's screen sex represents a real risk, and a demonstration that she's willing to own her image.\n\n\nCertainly, though, she is used to being objectified. Under the Skin could scarcely have picked a better-equipped actress than Johansson to play a temptress with the sort of sexual charisma that can lure men to their doom: Just last month, New Yorker critic Anthony Lane had his knuckles rapped by the blogosphere after his profile of the star was received as a 5,430-word ogle. Of Johansson, Lane extolled that \"she seemed to be made of champagne\" and was \"radiant in the flesh\"; of Lane, Slate's Katy Waldman wrote that the critic was so thoroughly objectifying Johansson that he \"refuse[d] to treat her as a human subject, with qualities of mind.\"\n\n\nThat's a conflict that Johansson has had to navigate for most of her adult career; the notion that her character in Under the Skin is experiencing \"a journey from 'it' to 'she,'\" in Glazer's words, could also apply to Marvel's treatment of Johansson as its sole superheroine Black Widow. First introduced as no more than a sexual fetish object in Iron Man 2 \u2014 when Johansson showed up on set in her skintight costume, bragged director Jon Favreau, \"You never heard a crew get quiet so fast\" \u2014 Black Widow was eventually redeemed by the interest Joss Whedon paid her in The Avengers, where she had more screen time than most of her fellow superheroes and was granted a complicated interior life (and a backstory full of dangerous deal-breakers) that the first film could only hint at.\n\nThat's expanded on, in fits and starts, by Johansson's reappearance in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, where she gets to throw way more punches than the other female co-leads in this cinematic universe and is treated as Captain America's platonic equal, for the most part. The film feints at sexual tension between its leads from time to time \u2014 Black Widow and Captain America even kiss once, as part of a ruse to fool the bad guys \u2014 though Chris Evans plays Captain America as so stolid and straight-arrow that he evinces no hormonal desire whatsoever. (Does the man even masturbate?) When you've got Johansson acting with an actor whose chest is nearly as bountiful as hers, perhaps you owe it to the audience to at least attempt pairing them up, but even Johansson's copious charms can't pull Captain America out of his shell.\n\n\nThe main question in Winter Soldier, though, isn't \"will they or won't they\": It's whether Johansson's Black Widow can be trusted, since she knows more of the film's secrets than Captain America and she's awfully cagey with how often she doles them out. That's important to note, because Johansson's intellect is a key element of her screen sexuality. In fact, in many of Johansson's movies, the central tension is derived from the fact that she's smarter than the male character she's coupled with: In both Under"}

{"id": 1313, "ended": true, "length": 908, "text": "Credit: Trenchfoot Creative Commons Swiss engineers have developed a new imaging technique that lets them see the insides of massive concrete bridges. Much like a sonogram, this technique provides quick, easy-to-interpret images, so that the health of these expensive structures can be assessed and monitored.\n\nThe patient weighs several tons and is hundreds of meters long. His body is made of concrete, reinforced by a skeleton of steel. Like living creatures, bridges sometimes have health problems. EPFL engineers have developed an imaging technique that permits a quick and easy diagnosis of corrosion in the steel rebar skeleton, the most serious problem that these grand, artistic structures can encounter. This method will result in a considerable reduction in the cost and inconvenience of rehabilitation work.\n\nThe process, developed as part of the PhD research of Alexis Kalogeropoulos, is based on a technique known as \"georadar,\" which uses microwave radiation to penetrate the insides of the bridge. Numerical treatment of the data yields images that are precise and easy to interpret. The goal is to detect corrosion in the steel rebar \u2013 which is the primary weakness in structures made of reinforced concrete.\n\nHumidity and ion chlorydes in a bridge structure as seen by the EPFL imaging system\n\nContrary to what one might think, concrete is a porous material. It's riddled with a network of tiny veins, barely a micrometer wide. \"Even the best concretes have this defect,\" explains professor Eugen Br\u00fchwiler, head of EPFL's Structural Engineering Group, who led the study. Water infiltrates into the concrete through these tiny channels, carrying a variety of substances, such as chloride ions from salt used for de-icing, into the heart of the bridge. These substances gradually oxidize the steel rebar deep within the concrete. \"The same problem occurs in concrete buildings near the ocean, where salt from sea spray is naturally present.\"\n\nCurrently, the most widely used diagnostic method is to drill core samples from the bridge deck. A maximum of ten samples can be taken from a 100-meter bridge. \"This method is too random to be able to precisely predict the magnitude and duration of rehabilitation, and thus to optimize the intervention,\" explains Br\u00fchwiler.\n\nFor the past decade, Georadar has been used to get a better picture of what's going on. Mounted on a vehicle, a device sends radiation into the structure, then records the reflected signal. Much like a sonogram, this method gives engineers a look at the insides of the bridge \u2013 and allows them to diagnose various conditions such as construction defects, water pockets, and the presence of chloride ions. The drawback, like in medical applications, is that it takes an expert eye to be able to read the results. Br\u00fchwiler shows an image to demonstrate \u2013 a piece of a slab from a bridge, sliced up into irregular layers of several shades of gray. \"In Switzerland there are only two or three people who are capable of interpreting this data, with at best an accuracy of 70%. I would be completely at a loss.\"\n\nThe new data processing and analysis method makes the whole process much more precise and accessible. Images from the reflected signal are clear and readable. They allow engineers to detect rebar, water pockets, construction defects like gravel pockets, and above all, chloride ions, at a glance. \"As is generally the case with this kind of method, we don't detect the corrosion itself, but indirect effects, in this case, chloride ions,\" explains Br\u00fchwiler. And in addition to facilitating interpretation of the results, the technique has been shown in the field to render diagnoses with an accuracy of more than 90%. The first successful application was carried out on a highway bridge in the canton Appenzell, and it will soon be repeated closer to EPFL as part of a project commissioned by the Swiss Federal Roads Office.\n\n\"It's a world first,\" says the researcher. \"With our method, bridge rehabilitation will be easier to plan and the costs will be easier to determine.\" It will be possible to scan an entire 100-meter bridge in just a few hours, and thus traffic disruption will be reduced. This research included contributions from scientists at EPFL, ETH Zurich and Empa, who combined their expertise in fields such as materials science, measurement methods and signal processing.\n\nExplore further: Scientists work to stop bridge corrosion"}

The number of left-wing extremists he shot dead never troubled me, the attack in itself never troubled me or surprised me for that sake but this very shameful fact troubled me from day one, and it still troubles me.\n\n\nMy first reaction to this was of course shame. How can my countrymen be so extremely coward and indeed helpless? What is wrong with them? I mean, any sane, healthy and unbroken (so to speak) human being in such a situation would at least try to fight back, organize small bands armed with rocks and sticks, and try to ambush the guy et cetera. Sure, a few attackers would surely be killed if a group had attacked him, but he would have been overwhelmed in the end, and it would have ended his massacre. Even with a bullet or two in your body you can still fight on, only to die later from blood loss. You are not helpless even when severely wounded. You only need a fighting spirit to keep on fighting. You might think differently, but I know that. I have fought on wounded (with a crushed jaw) myself (and emerged victorious), and I have seen others do the same; the best known of them would be Aarseth, who stopped running and fought back even after he had been stabbed at least 7 times and had had both his lungs punctured. He did because he was cornered by then, but still. Even those cornered on Ut\u00f8ya didn't fight back, exept the one example I mentioned above. The others did nothing. Some of them stopped, resigned and just waited for him to shoot them. Others lay down covering their heads with their arms. Some begged for mercy. They were all executed by Mr. Breivik.\n\n\nThe social darwinist in me applaud this; cowards like that deserve to die! However, I think I understand why they reacted that way. You see, I too grew up in the \"Social Democratic\" (i. e. Marxist) Norway. So let me tell you a short story about this oh-so-blissful country of Norway....\n\n\nLike almost all Norwegians I first met the true Norway in kindergarten; a children's prison with left-wing extremist feminist guards, indoctrinating their helpless victims with lie-propaganda and forcing the children to \"share\" and \"be kind\" to each other. No competition was allowed. No \"winning\" or indeed \"losing\" was allowed; everyone were supposed to always be equals in all and everything. No playing alone was allowed. You play with others kids (in communion) and sing happy extremist songs with the fanatic \"prison guards\". The brave kids and I was one of them ran away from this, tried to hide from the \"guards\" in the playground and even tried to escape from the kindergarten. I was only three years old when I first scaled the fence and ran the 2 km back home, through the streets, all by myself. When home I called the door bell to get in and was \"arrested\" by my mother, who for some reason was home from work that day, and she mercilessly sent me back to the Marxist children's GULag.\n\n\nMy story differs a bit from that of other poor Norwegian children, though. My liberation from kindergarten came sooner, when my father was hired to work for Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 1979. He was one of those engineers who helped build Iraq in the years after Saddam Hussein had become president. The English school in Baghdad was full, so when I was 6 years old I was sent to ordinary Iraqi public school.\n\n\nIraq was a bad experience in so many ways; my brother and I had to fight off attackers several times, in school and in the streets, we barely escaped rabies infected packs of dogs chasing us in the streets, we once had to run for our lives from a drunk killer, who was still wielding the axe he had used when he killed his wife (he was later shot dead by Iraqi police in the streets), we almost died from food poisoning and so forth. I can add that I also saved the life of an Englishman there, who had drowned in a pool (and he was rescued and resuscitated because to me). I think my parents were extremely irresponsible for taking their family to live in Iraq, but I guess they didn't have the opportunity to know any better like we do today (we can just google it). However, at least I was able to see more of reality than I was in Norway. Reality had in Norway been replaced by some sort of \"Social Democratic reality-substitute\", where everything is perfect, and where the mighty Norwegian state takes care of everything. Soviet Norway holds your hand, ad mortem.\n\n\nWhen I returned to Norway I was sent to primary school and"}

On Saturday at the annual Latin America conference, which took place at the TUC's Congress House, a minute's silence was observed. The former Respect MP George Galloway spoke of Castro's legacy after tweeting a picture of himself with the late Cuban leader and declaring: \"You were the greatest man I ever met Comandante Fidel. You were the man of the century. Hasta la Victoria Siempre. Orden. RIP.\"\n\nEarlier the Nicaraguan ambassador had drawn loud applause for dedicating the day to the man and his country, declaring: \"Viva Cuba, viva Fidel.\"\n\nRob Miller, director of the Cuba Solidarity Campaign, acknowledged that for many at the conference, Castro was an inspiration: \"Certainly Fidel, Ra\u00fal [Castro's brother] and Che Guevera are historic leaders of a revolution that happened not all that long ago. This is living history. They are revered as the historic generation.\"\n\nMiller recalled visiting Cuba in 1978 as a 15-year-old attending an international youth festival. Also on the trip were future Labour heavyweights Peter Mandelson and Charles Clarke. \"A whole host of people came back inspired by what they had seen. This was the beginning of the Cuban solidarity campaign in this country and many of those who came back are still very much involved in it today.\"\n\nFor Miller, the visit to Cuba under Castro was transformational. \"In the 1970s, before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba really had everything. It was a time of flourishing, of culture, music, dance, education and sports. Cuba was rapidly moving from being a very backward country pre the revolution to a country that was blossoming in every single way. The results are still there. You see Cuba punch above its weight in every sort of sphere. There was an optimism that was palpable,\" he said. \"The Vietnam war had just been won and there were people from Vietnam there; the Palestinians were there, campaigners from South Africa, and it was a very, very vibrant time. It was inspirational for me personally.\"\n\nAs the US embarked on a decades-long attempt at destabilisation, Castro's fight for survival became synonymous with his country's battle for autonomy. Many on the left of British politics feared that the CIA was intent on regime change across Central and South America, and started to champion the Caribbean island and its charismatic leader, whose influence and appeal grew with each day that he remained in power.\n\n\"Cuba stood firm in a David and Goliath way,\" Miller said. \"And Fidel himself became a beacon of resistance, demonstrating that there was the possibility for a small people to win their power and hold on to their power despite every possible provocation and blockade. The fact that Cuba still stood independent despite the deprivations is a real, lasting legacy.\"\n\nHowever, others on the left tempered their praise of the Cuban leader with explicit criticisms. Lord Hain, the former Labour cabinet minister and anti-apartheid leader, said: \"Although responsible for indefensible human rights and free speech abuses, Castro created a society of unparalleled access to free health, education and equal opportunity despite an economically throttling US siege. His troops inflicted the first defeat on South Africa's troops in Angola in 1988, a vital turning point in the struggle against apartheid.\"\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jeremy Corbyn said Castro would be remembered as an \"internationalist and a champion of social justice\". Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA\n\n\"Fidel Castro's death marks the passing of a huge figure of modern history, national independence and 20th-century socialism,\" said the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who claimed that \"for all his flaws\" Castro would be remembered as an \"internationalist and a champion of social justice\".\n\nThe former London mayor Ken Livingstone said Castro was an \"absolute giant of the 20th century\".\n\n\"Of course, Fidel did things that were wrong,\" Livingstone said. \"Initially he wasn't very good on lesbian and gay rights, but the key things that mattered was that people had a good education, good healthcare, and wealth was evenly distributed. He was not living as a billionaire laundering money off into a Panamanian bank account or anything like that \u2013 he was good for the people.\"\n\nMiller suggested that Castro's politics were enjoying a renaissance: \"Today, people are looking for alternatives, something different, and the relevance of the politics \u2013 socialism, if you like \u2013 in the Cuba embodied by Fidel, by Che, is becoming more interesting to people. They're fed up with the current political infrastructure, which doesn't really empower most people to play an active part within their societies."}

Multiplicity/Subjective Knowledge:\n\nThere are conflicting answers;\n\ntherefore, students must trust their \"inner voices\", not external Authority. Early Multiplicity:\n\nThere are 2 kinds of problems:\n\nthose whose solutions we know\n\nthose whose solutions we don't know yet (thus, a kind of dualism).\n\nStudent's task is to learn how to find the Right Solutions. Late Multiplicity:\n\nMost problems are of the second kind;\n\ntherefore, everyone has a right to their own opinion;\n\nor some problems are unsolvable;\n\ntherefore, it doesn't matter which (if any) solution you choose. Student's task is to shoot the bull.\n\n(Most freshman are at this position, which is a kind of relativism) At this point, some students become alienated, and either retreat to an earlier (\"safer\") position (\"I think I'll study math, not literature, because there are clear answers and not as much uncertainty\") or else escape (drop out) (\"I can't stand college; all they want is right answers\" or else \"I can't stand college; no one gives you the right answers\".) Rapaport's speculation, part 2: Perhaps we evolve into Multiplists after we learn things tacitly and have internal or implicit \"feelings\" or intuitions about things, but not conscious or explicit beliefs that can be explained or justified. Relativism/Procedural Knowledge:\n\nThere are disciplinary reasoning methods:\n\nConnected knowledge: empathetic (why do you believe X?; what does this poem say to me?)\n\nvs. Separated knowledge: \"objective analysis\" (what techniques can I use to analyze this poem?) Contextual Relativism:\n\nAll proposed solutions are supported by reasons;\n\ni.e., must be viewed in context & relative to support.\n\nSome solutions are better than others, depending on context.\n\nStudent's task is to learn to evaluate solutions. Rapaport's speculation, part 3: Perhaps we then evolve into Contextual Relativists when we can express our intuitions in language and seek justifications for them and relationships among them. \"Pre-Commitment\":\n\nStudent sees the necessity of: making choices\n\ncommitting to a solution Commitment/Constructed Knowledge:\n\nIntegration of knowledge learned from others with personal experience and reflection. Commitment:\n\nStudent makes a commitment. Challenges to Commitment:\n\nStudent experiences implications of commitment.\n\nStudent explores issues of responsibility. \"Post-Commitment\":\n\nStudent realizes commitment is an ongoing, unfolding, evolving activity The journey is sometimes repeated; and one can be at different stages at the same time with respect to different subjects.\n\nReferences:"}

The case eventually was settled two years later after Trump tried to countersue the Justice Department for $100 million for making false statements. Those allegations were dismissed by the court.\n\n\"Donald started his career, back in 1973, being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination \u2014 because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy,\" Clinton said on Monday night.\n\nTrump responded to Clinton by emphasizing that the case was settled with no admission of guilt.\n\n\"Yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company \u2014 had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens,\" Trump said. \"And we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country \u2014 it was a federal lawsuit \u2014 were sued. We settled the suit with zero, with no admission of guilt.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was based on evidence gathered by testers for the New York City Human Rights Division, which alleged that black people who went to Trump buildings were told there were no apartments available, while white people were offered units.\n\nBack then, Sheila Morse worked as one of those testers. When a black New Yorker was turned down for service and racial bias was suspected, Morse, who is white, would be dispatched to see if she received different treatment.\n\nIn this case, a black man in search of an apartment in Brooklyn in 1972 saw a sign on a building: \"apartment for rent.\"\n\n\"He met with the superintendent, and the superintendent said, 'I'm very sorry, but the apartment is rented \u2014 it's gone,' \" Morse says. \"So the gentlemen said to him, 'Well, why is the sign out? I still see a sign that says apartment for rent.' And the superintendent said, 'Oh, I guess I forgot to take it down.' \"\n\nWhen Morse went to the building to ask about the same apartment, she says, \"They greeted me with open arms and showed me every aspect of the apartment.\"\n\nMorse says she reported her experience to the Human Rights Commission, and then returned to the apartment building. After she was offered a lease, the black man who had tried to rent the apartment entered the office with a city human rights commissioner, and the three of them confronted the building superintendent.\n\n\"He said, 'Well, I'm only doing what my boss told me to do \u2014 I am not allowed to rent to black tenants,' \" Morse says.\n\nThe commissioner asked the building superintendent to take him to his boss. That turned out to be Trump Management.\n\nWashington Post reporter Michael Kranish, co-author of the book Trump Revealed, tells NPR's Robert Siegel that the Justice Department considered the case \"one of the most significant race bias cases\" at the time.\n\nIt was a suit that was directly against them, and it is one that Donald Trump to this day clearly is upset about.\n\n\"They signed what was called a consent order,\" Kranish says. \"Trump fought the case for two years. ... He says it was very easy, but actually he fought the case for two years.\"\n\nThe Trumps took essentially the first settlement offer the federal government provided, Kranish says; the Trumps did not, in fact, have to admit guilt in settling the suit.\n\n\"[The settlement] required the Trumps to place ads in newspapers saying that they welcomed black applicants,\" Kranish says. \"It said that the Trumps would familiarize themselves with the Fair Housing Act, which prohibited discrimination. So it also specifically said they don't admit wrongdoing, but they did have to take several measures that the Trumps had fought for two years not to take.\"\n\nTrump claims the Justice Department lawsuit was just one of many housing cases against many landlords, but Kranish says this description is misleading.\n\n\"Well, there were cases brought against various companies, but the point here is that Trump has said in the debate \u2014 and he also told me when I interviewed him at Trump Tower earlier this year \u2014 that this was part of one massive suit.\" Kranish says, \"And in fact, this very specifically is a case that charges Donald Trump, Fred Trump and their company of race bias in housing rentals. ... It was one of the largest cases of the time. ...\n\n\"It was a suit that was directly against them, and it is one that Donald Trump to this day clearly is upset about.\""}

The size of the project is unknown, but Related Group does have the property under contract. Ackerman & Co. has owned all of the property along that side of Stratford Road for a long time.\n\nWhat is interesting is that this proposed development site is almost across Peachtree Road from a site behind Lenox Square mall where Related Group had previously submitted plans for twin high-rise apartment towers in conjunction with Simon Property Group Inc., which owns the mall.\n\nSimon and Related Group entered talks in 2013 about a two-phase development project behind the mall that included 750 residential units. But reports are that Simon now is reaching out to other prospective development partners for that project.\n\nBack in 2006, Related Group had big development plans for Buckhead, proposing a $2 billion project called CityPlace Buckhead on 16 acres at Roxboro and East Paces Ferry roads. That project was to have included at least six condo towers with roughly 3,800 units.\n\nRelated pulled the plug on that project when the credit market dried up due to the recent recession. The complexion of the project has changed dramatically and now is being developed primarily as apartments by Amli.\n\nBuckheadView plans to cover the May 6 meeting of the SPI-12 Development Review Committee and will report on what is presented regarding the new Related Group project on Peachtree."}

If you know any other issues Brawl has that you would like to be added to the list, please drop me an email at Evilagram@yahoo.com Global Changes: Stale Moves is brutal (effect increased drastically) and stales knockback in a large cue of moves instead of percentage damage exclusively -In Melee it was damage exclusively -In Smash 64, only one move would stale in damage and knockback, the system was significantly more lenient 2 frames of input delay at all times. This means that things happening on the screen have a 1/30th of a second delay before they happen. What is this? Dota 2? You can airdodge or perform normal attacks immediately out of hitstun with no penalty. Hitstun essentially doesn't exist. Brawl has a glitchy tech window that is dependent on how far away you are from the ground instead of just frames between when you touch the ground and press the button -In addition, Melee had a fail window that prevented players from button mashing or trying to hold the button during that frame Brawl lacks momentum capture, retaining inertia from a dash into a jump, this leads to many ground based characters losing a lot of use for their aerial attacks, and floaty aerial based characters losing much of the risk of being in the air. One great example is that captain falcon can no longer dash into a jumping falcon punch and retain momentum, enabling him to hit an opponent on the opposite side of the stage. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buuF3P9aLAg http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fc2QT_4LtQ (the second video shows how the momentum is reset on jump) C-sticks can continue jab loops. C-sticks affect control of a character's aerial momentum (kinda ruins the point of using the c-stick, doesn't it?) Brawl has a chance of randomly tripping on initial dashes, and a chance of tripping during the hitstun of many moves http://www.ssbwiki.com/Tripping Brawl added a universal 10 frame buffer on all inputs http://www.ssbwiki.com/Buffer Attacking someone in shield can push them off the edge of a platform or stage and it is UNTECHABLE Brawl has a long ledgegrab animation with many dead frames where the character cannot act which slows down gameplay for no reason, preventing or inhibiting a lot of strategies like ledgehopping Ledgegrabs gave a ridiculous amount of invincibility frames which lead to this being abused to the point of match stalling. http://balancedbrawl.net/global-changes/ledgegrab-limit/ http://www.ssbwiki.com/Camping#Planking Longer landing lag across all characters relative to melee's L canceled landing lag in addition to easily canceled hitstun and shieldstun means that successful approaches are now unsafe for no good reason. Resets on knocked down opponents were changed to no longer force knocked down players to get up, which lead to both making it harder to continue combos, and many characters being capable of locking knocked down characters to the ground with jabs or in falco's case lasers http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIP7QY0anuw Characters approaching the ledge snap onto it abruptly even while rising during an up+b animation or jump, immediately transitioning into invincibility frames, and also reducing the efficacy of edgeguarding techniques, making edgehogging the method of choice for preventing recoveries. There is no longer a reason to learn the sweet spot for recovery animations as the game will automatically perform this for you. also ledgegrab ranges were universally made longer Down smash is not possible while crouching, due to how the C-stick is handled. Wind knockback can push characters off of edges Grabs are heavily buffed, with the loss of the ability to SDI grabs and grabs not refreshing double jumps, leading to it being an amazing offstage option to screwing over players without much risk. You can grab someone as they recover, let go, and watch as they fall to their death. Brawl perfect shielding no longer activates based on when the button is pressed, but instead based on when the shield itself comes out, enabling players to \"buffer\" perfect shields, so that incoming attacks are very likely to be perfect shielded after performing a move Perfect shield window was increased, and no longer reflects projectiles Reverse ledgegrabs enable characters to shorthop off the stage and immediately grab the ledge.

And greed and hypocrisy.\n\nOnce upon a time in America, there was something called the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nApproved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1949, this rule insisted that because the airwaves belong to all of us, every TV and radio broadcast licensee must \"devote a reasonable portion of broadcast time to the discussion and consideration of controversial issues of public importance,\" and allow \"the expression of contrasting viewpoints.\"\n\nTranslation: When you present points of view from the right on your station, it behooves you to also present views from the left \u2014 and others \u2014 so that everyone's opinion gets a fair shake.\n\nHad the Fairness Doctrine remained in place, chances are the explosion of loud-mouthed bigotry on the air and across the internet might have been mitigated in part by a more balanced, countervailing progressive radio and TV to tell all sides of the story.\n\nThat was the rule, but it didn't sit well with conservatives and in 1987, during the latter part of the reign of Ronald Reagan, the Fairness Doctrine was revoked. The disappearance helped encourage the rise of right wing, hate talk radio and the incubator it provided for the likes of Fox News, Alex Jones and Breitbart.\n\nHad the Fairness Doctrine remained in place, chances are the explosion of loud-mouthed bigotry on the air and across the internet might have been mitigated in part by a more balanced, countervailing progressive radio and TV to tell all sides of the story. But the Fairness Doctrine is gone for good; there's little or no chance it ever will be reinstated.\n\nThat's because, as we've seen, many rules are meant to be broken, especially if you're part of a Republican Party that believes government rules should be stomped into the ground and eliminated. Rules keep corporate America from getting its way, from allowing it to run unfettered and unregulated, and must be abolished.\n\nUnless.\n\nSometimes there's a government rule that the right wing actually likes. Sometimes, in fact, there's even an old rule that you bring back; one that could do your big-business buddies some good.\n\nThat's what happened recently when the FCC, now chaired by Republican Ajit Pai, decided to reinstate a rule that was eliminated by Pai's predecessor. Turns out that it can come in very handy when helping friends achieve a merger that will create a powerful media behemoth dedicated to propagating a right-wing, pro-Trump worldview while raising consumer prices, eliminating independence and diversity and stifling community news coverage.\n\nThe Sinclair Broadcast Group, which already owns 173 TV stations in the United States, more than anyone else in the United States, proposes to buy Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, making Sinclair even bigger. Although it claims to present a wide range of viewpoints in its news and public affairs coverage, Sinclair is a company that's not shy about its conservative bias.\n\nIt is, in the words of former FCC commissioner Michael Copps, \"the most dangerous company most American's haven't heard of\u2026 No one company should have such power over the news and information that citizens must have.\"\n\nThe media activist group Allied Progress has published an exhaustive account of Sinclair's political agenda, \"its history of infecting local news coverage with politically charged programming.\"\n\nJust a few examples:\n\nFollowing 9/11, NPR's David Folkenflik reports:\n\nSinclair required the news and sports anchors and even weather forecasters to read editorial messages explicitly conveying full support for the Bush administration's fight against terrorism. After some staffers raised objections at its flagship station in Baltimore, Sinclair officials allowed anchors there to say the message was from \"station management.\"\n\nIn 2004, Sinclair refused to allow its ABC affiliates to air an episode of Nightline that read out the names of every service member killed in Iraq, claiming that the broadcast was intended to hurt President George W. Bush. That same year, Sinclair announced plans to air a documentary called Stolen Honor, attacking presidential candidate John Kerry's Vietnam War record.\n\nAccording to Paul Farhi of The Washington Post:\n\nAfter complaints from Democrats and calls for an advertiser boycott, Sinclair backed down and ran a program that analysts said was more balanced. The company nevertheless fired its Washington bureau chief after he publicly said that plans to air the anti-Kerry film were \"indefensible.\"\n\nDuring the midterm elections of 2010, Sinclair distributed to its stations an infomercial paid for by the National Republican Trust PAC, that called President Obama a socialist and claimed he had raised campaign funds from Hamas. And during Barack Obama's re-election campaign in 2012, on the night before Election Day, a half-hour special, attacking Obamacare and other Obama policies, aired"}

All he wanted to do, he told a crowd of his supporters, was address his concern that an undefined \"they\" were attempting \"to take away our history and our heritage.\"\n\nThat language merely puts a presentable face on the racism that left counter-protesters bloodied on the streets of Charlottesville, according to former skinheads and law enforcement who've worked with them. Those individuals told TPM that Trump's comments used the same rhetorical lures that white supremacists and other hate groups rely on to hook new members.\n\n\"It's dangerous because it creates a distinction between us and them,\" said Michael German, a former FBI special agent who during his time in law enforcement went undercover with neo-Nazi skinheads in southern California and anti-government militia groups. \"When Donald Trump talks about us and our heritage he's only speaking to one audience, and that audience then starts to view others who are fellow Americans as somehow the enemy.\"\n\n\"The rhetoric draws people in because it makes them feel like they are losing something terribly important. It perpetuates the us vs. them mentality and serves no one,\" echoed Angela King, a former skinhead who spent six years in prison for assisting an armed robbery of a Jewish-owned store. King went on to co-found Life After Hate, a nonprofit that works with former members of violent far-right groups.\n\nThe criticism that Trump is dog-whistling to disaffected whites is nothing new for a politician who kicked off his presidential campaign by calling Mexicans drug dealers and criminals, and who once proposed banning all Muslim immigrants to the U.S. The White House has brushed it off, insisting that Trump \"of course\" condemns \"white Supremacists, KKK, neo-nazi and all extremist groups.\"\n\n\"We have condemned these groups over and over again and will continue to do so,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a Thursday statement to TPM. \"There is no place for hate and bigotry in our country.\"\n\nBut after a week of flailing statements on the violence in Charlottesville that were cheered by the extremist fringe and criticized by just about everyone else, the President has landed on talking points that those same groups use to justify their movement and bring new people into the fold.\n\nTrump's remarks on George Washington offer one telling example. \"George Washington was a slave owner. So will George Washington now lose his status?\" the President asked reporters last week at Trump Tower. \"Are we going to take down, are we going to take down statues to George Washington?\"\n\n\"How about Thomas Jefferson?\" he added. \"Because he was a major slave owner. Now are we going to take down his statue?\"\n\nOn that same day, onetime GOP presidential candidate and nativist commentator Pat Buchanan made the very same point in a column republished by white nationalist publication American Renaissance.\n\n\"Many Southern towns, including Alexandria, Virginia, have statues of Confederate soldiers looking to the South. Shall we pull them all down?\" he wrote.\"And once all the Southern Civil War monuments are gone, should we go after the statues of the slave owners whom we Americans have heroized? Gen. George Washington and his subordinate, 'Light Horse Harry' Lee, father of Robert E. Lee, were slave owners, as was Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe and Andrew Jackson.\"\n\nConservative pundits have made similar arguments on Fox News couches in recent days. As Derek Black, the son of the founder of white supremacist website Stormfront, pointed out in a New York Times op-ed this week, few Americans would justify marching down the streets of a U.S. city brandishing a swastika flag, but many more feel comfortable lamenting what they are being told is the erasure of U.S. history.\n\n\"My dad often gave me the advice that white nationalists are not looking to recruit people on the fringes of American culture, but rather the people who start a sentence by saying, 'I'm not racist, but \u2026',\" Black, who has disavowed the movement, wrote of his father, Don. \"The most effective tactics for white nationalists are to associate American history with themselves and to suggest that the collective efforts to turn away from our white supremacist past are the same as abandoning American culture.\"\n\nFrank Meeink, a former neo-Nazi who left the movement after a stint in prison as a teenager for kidnapping one man and beating another, told TPM that he used those sort of \"common sense,\" pseudo-academic appeals to recruit residents of his South Philadelphia neighborhood into his skinhead gang.\n\n\"It's the biggest bait and switch. You're down and out and people are saying, 'Come be proud of your heritage, they're telling you you can't be,"}

Our Goal Is To Magnify Your Financial Education At These Critical Times. Gain Immediate Access To Our Wide-Range of Top-Conviction Reports HERE!\n\nDecember has been an incredibly busy month for the firearms industry. Thanks to draconian gun laws put into place by California liberals, demand for semiautomatic rifles with \"militarized features\" \u2014 such as the AR15 or AK47 \u2014 have gone through the roof. In turn, the irony of firearm restrictions have been pushed to center stage. More often than not, tough gun laws actually promote gun sales rather than curbing them.\n\nAt issue is Assembly Bill 1664, which effectively bans the sale of popular rifles like the AR15 beginning in 2017. However, due to California's minimum ten day background check period, the last date to actually purchase an AR15 or similar rifle was on December 21. Also drawing the ire of Second Amendment proponents is that in 2018, the AR15 will be legally declared an \"assault weapon.\" Thanks to California liberals, law-abiding citizens must either register their offending rifles as assault weapons, or render them \"featureless\" \u2014 ie. removing offending components such as a vertical pistol grip and detachable magazine.\n\nAs expected, this has had a profound effect on publicly traded gun stocks. During the core periods of the Obama administration, gun stocks were dominating the markets. Proposed federal gun laws \u2014 aided by California liberals and the leftist machinery \u2014 were met eagerly by a progressive-leaning public. Fear among firearm owners and those who may not otherwise considered gun ownership flocked to weapons dealers. Gun sales spiked every time a mass shooting occurred, or when politicians began lecturing entities like the National Rifle Association.\n\nThis was a net positive for gun stocks thanks to an incredible revenue boost. But under the crushing weight of AB 1664, gun stocks fell out of favor in the second half of 2016. Wall Street analysts questioned whether or not gun stocks could survive losing an entire state of sales, let alone the most populous state in the nation.\n\nHowever, gun stocks may be getting a reprieve in 2017. First, gun sales in December \u2014 when disclosed \u2014 are going to be massive. Long gun sales in California for November was an astounding 11% of the national whole! With the hard deadline looming, I can virtually guarantee that gun stocks will see an unprecedented revenue spike in the fourth quarter.\n\nNo one wants to give up these gun sales. Fortunately, there are a growing number of businesses that are introducing new California compliant accessories that will allow shooters to legally own and operate AR15s without dealing with assault weapons registration. This will encourage gun stocks to continue providing semiautomatic rifles to California residents.\n\nIt may also lead to one of the big comebacks of 2017."}

The year 2016 had seen 53 cases of honour killings in Swat. The NGO, which works for women's rights in Swat and provides legal aid to families of the victims, has revealed that a lot of these cases are disguised as suicides.\n\nSwat police have denied the reliability of these reports. Figures taken by Mingora superintendent of police (SP) claim that there had been 11 instances of honour killings this year, while there had been 6 cases in 2016.\n\nMingora Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Habibullah told Pakistan Today that Swat police were working hard to tackle the issue of honour killings in the district. He said that cases of honour killings would be filed by the state now, expressing his hopes that this would deter the evil practice and bring the perpetrators of the crime to justice. According to the police, three cases have been filed by the state and are all under hearing at court.\n\nThe police said that members of the victims' families were usually involved in honour killings and to prevent themselves from disgrace, the other aggrieved family members did not bring the cases to the police, preferring the local jirgas to resolve the matter instead. If the police did make arrests, people did not appear before court to testify. This allowed criminals to escape readily from punishment, they said.\n\nSwat bar senior lawyer Sohail Sultan observed that Swat came under the provincially administered tribal areas and therefore many laws which safeguarded women's rights had not been extended to the area, which was a direct cause of the growing number of honour killings in Swat.\n\nAccording to the Swat's women jirga head Tabassum Adnan, the main reason for the rise of honour killings in Swat was the lack of effective legislation, which allowed criminals to run free without fear of punishment.\n\nAccording to a woman social worker, the strong grip of traditions over the people was the main cause of such practices in the district, since the traditions barred women from gaining higher education and practising their choice in marriage. When a woman tries to marry by her own choice, she becomes a victim of honour killing, she said.\n\nThe civil society of Swat has expressed concerns and recorded protests against the rising incidents of honour killings in the district, subjecting NGOs, government policies and law enforcement agencies to sharp criticism for failing to prevent such events from happening."}

That means that some of their clothing suggestions don't work for me and, I guess, for others like me. I'd described myself as a reverted triangle, or top heavy. Just like every body type, it comes with its own set of challenges and perks. I also happen to think that a lot of the advice for apple shaped/narrow-hipped busty women is whack! So, I thought I would share a few tips that have worked for me.\n\nI believe that the hardest item to find to fit a figure like mine is a dress. Hourglasses often complain that they have to deal with a baggy waistline in order to fit their boobs and hips. In our case, the waist might be ok, as long as there is enough boob space, but the hips area will be baggy. In my experience, most size charts, even those of bust friendly companies, assume that your hips are larger than your bust. That being said, dresses get all the love, but being one or several sizes larger up top than down bottom means that separates are your friends!\n\nMatching separates can give you the look of a dress, with the option to get different sizes in each item. Plus, you can still rock the top and skirt separately.\n\nYou can buy a specifically matching top and skirt set, like this one I got from Etam a few years ago.\n\nEvery time I'm wearing this, I get complimented about my \"dress\". I like to pair it with the red shoes below. I have no idea where they come from as they were a handout from a friend.\n\nYou can also make your own matching separates. Here, I'm pairing an Urkye top with a skirt that I also got from a friend, with whom I sometimes swap clothes.\n\nAs you can see (well not so clearly, sorry about the blurry pics), it is quite easy with black.\n\nBut you shouldn't shy away from colour! I didn't buy the top and skirt below to be worn together. I just happen to like orange a lot.\n\nThe top is from Etam (a few years back) and the skirt from H&M (last year's collection).\n\nThese are actually not the exact same shade and they're made of very different fabrics. This is not very noticeable from afar, but to tie them up together more and accentuate the dress illusion, I like to throw my Urkye cardigan on top like this:\n\nPeople who've seen me in this top gazillions of times have asked where I got my \"new dress\"!\n\nBelts are not my thing, but they can also be a good way to \"tie up\" top and bottom. You can also match solid fabrics and prints and stil get this illusion if you manage to get the shade right. If you shorten the hem of a printed skirt, you can keep the trim to adorn a top so that it matches the skirt. The possibilities are endless. Your skirt can be an S and your top an L and nobody will be the wiser\u2026\n\nI am not the type to keep an extensive wardrobe and I tend to buy clothes ony when I need them, so I've owned all the items presented for several years, except for the Urkye top and cardigan, which I've reviewed here. The idea was not to write a fashion blog, but to share this simple tip, that you can duplicate with what's in your wardrobe.\n\nAdvertisements"}

It's a new app that provides a strategic battle plan for victory in the struggle against pornography. Here are five of its features, which, are also five reasons you need to download it now.\n\n1. One Day at a Time\n\nRecovery from porn addiction isn't something that happens to you, rather, it's a series of daily \u2014 sometimes hourly \u2014 choices we make by our actions. The victory app reinforces this by allowing you to track your progress one day at a time. When you open the Victory app you'll see a calendar displaying the month you're in. At a quick glance you'll see the days you had setbacks (indicated by grey squares), the days you experienced victory (indicated by white squares), and even the days you went to the Sacrament of Confession (indicated by green squares).\n\n2. Daily Check-In's\n\nMorning, Noon, and Night, the Victory app notifies you to check-in. How are you doing \u2013 good, okay, bad? You can let the app know if you've had a setback, and it will take you to another page to assess that setback \u2013 were you bored, lonely, angry, stressed, or tired? What was it that triggered you (got you thinking about looking at porn)? After a couple of months, you'll be able to check and see how much progress you've made from the previous months.\n\n3. Accountability Button (aka, the \"Bat Signal\")\n\nIn the fight against porn addiction, no person is an island. We need each other. That's why we've put a handy-dandy accountability button (lovingly called the \"bat signal\") at the top right-hand side of the screen. In the app \"settings,\" you can enter up to three accountability partners. In a moment of temptation, you can press this \"Accountability button\" and those accountability partners will be notified on their phones (even if they're locked) with this simple message, \"Please pray for (your name).\" How cool is that?\n\n4. Daily Inspiration\n\nMark Hart and I have written over 50 entries for daily inspiration. These entries will educate, motivate, and challenge you.\n\n5. It's Discreet\n\nIt's called Victory, and not, \"I wish I could stop looking at porn.\" Plus, if someone does try and open the app, they won't be able to without first entering a four-digit passcode set by you.

It's with Prof Vincent Walsh of UCL, one of the world's preeminent cognitive neuroscientists with a strong interest in the study of creativity. Here we talk about how your brain generates ideas, how you're aware of less than 1% of your brain's activity, and the science which shows that creativity is not a team sport.\n\nIn the video above (shortened interview), we cover a vast range of topics related to the neuroscience of creativity. I have also included the Top 6 most interesting points from the extended interview here (some of which are in addition to what's in the video). I know that some of you may disagree with some of these points (in some cases strongly disagree) and I encourage you to share your thoughts in the comments. Just be aware that what is discussed here is with one of the top academic researchers on the subject and is backed up by research and evidence which may be new to you, some of it about to be published. (See Vincent's bibliography). If you like the information here, you can find more in our Online Innovation and Creativity Training\n\nI first came across Professor Walsh's work about a year ago when I was uncovering what actually makes people have ideas. Then a few weeks ago, I found out that he had been referencing one of my own books, 30 Days of Creativity Training [Amazon], in some of his recent public lectures. I jumped at the chance to talk to him about the latest research and evidence on how to help people improve their creativity. Check out the video above, and then get more detail on the Top 6 most interesting points here:\n\nTop 6 most interesting points from the extended interview:\n\n1. You're only aware of less than 1% of your brain activity, and most creativity happens in the other 99%\n\nProfessor Walsh's research on cognition indicates that all of your conscious thought, which includes language, problem-solving ability and awareness of your senses, makes up less than 1% of your brain activity. So while the old saying that \"you only use 10% of your brain\" is not true, it's amazing to see that the vast majority of your brain activity is actually going on without you being aware of it.\n\nGeneration of completely new ideas is one thing which happens \"behind the wall\" as Professor Walsh refers to it. Ideas are generated when your brain takes existing knowledge and memories, and forms a new neural connection which did not previously exist, thereby linking together and building on concepts in a new way, which sometimes generates a solution to a challenge (a new idea).\n\n2. If you want to stimulate an idea, you need to give your brain time to go \"off-line\"\n\nMuch like your heartbeat, your brain works at various activity levels throughout the day. However, the linking of new neural connections and the generation of ideas happens best when your brain is at a lower, more relaxed state, called an \"alpha state\". If you are extremely focused on something, whether it be a conversation you're in, a piece of work in front of you, listening to something intently or trying to work something out mentally, then these activities actually put your brain in a higher activity level and takes its energy resources, which masks your brain's ability to form new connections and generate ideas. So if you're a workaholic, such as someone working 60+ hours a week, you're really harming you brain's ability to come up with creative ideas and solutions.\n\nTo improve your ability to come up with an idea, it is therefore important to give your mind the space to get into a relaxed state. This is evidenced both through thousands of stories of people coming up with breakthrough ideas when they weren't expecting it and when their mind was elsewhere. Science has shown this recently through brain scanning associated with sleep, and the ability to come up with solutions to a challenge after the brain had been given a rest.

Creativity is not a team sport, and brainstorming is a terrible way to generate good ideas\n\n\"Managers cannot manage creative teams. They can only allow their people to be creative themselves\". It is extremely difficult to communicate an idea which is in your head. People are limited by the language they can use to describe the idea, how the other person interprets that communication, and by the different associations which exist for the same concept between people. The generation of ideas happens within individuals, and therefore you cannot put individuals or groups together and instruct them how and when to be creative.\n\nBrainstorming sessions and equivalent ideation techniques like Creative Problem Solving have an ever-growing body of evidence showing them to be an ineffective way to generate good ideas.

Young tea is around 5 to 20 years old. Tea bushes that are younger than 3 years of age will rarely be harvested in Yunnan as they are still maturing. We will broadly define middle-aged as anything from 20 to 80 years old. Any trees older than 80 years old are quite old and are already very mature, so we will lump them in as old arbor, even though that might make some age queens angry. Some of you who frequently read the descriptions scattered around the internet about 1000 years old trees might be scratching your heads thinking, \"100 years old doesn't seem very old!\". I'd like to gently assure you that even 100 year old trees are the minority in Yunnan and produce spectacular quality tea. Don't get too caught up in claims made about tree ages. It sounds sexy to drink tea from 500 year old trees, but 99.9% of the time the people who bother advertising that as a selling point are selling you an idea rather than the tea in the description.\n\nThe youngest trees, which are usually planted as terrace tea, tend to be ready for spring picking far earlier than their older counterparts. The younger the tea, the earlier it is ready to be picked. In certain low lying areas of Yunnan, this might even mean being ready as early as February, however it more likely means early to mid-March. These are general rules which are weather dependent. That being acknowledged, it would be very rare that spring tea, which we can define as the tea that sprouts forth after a dormant winter, would be ready any earlier than February. Middle Aged tea trees will be slightly later than this, you can think of youth and readiness on a spectrum, with increasing age meaning later budding.\n\nThe older trees sprout forth much later in the season than younger tea trees. Old arbor Puer is ready to be plucked in late March at the earliest. Weather fluctuations aside, the earliest I have ever seen old arbor Puer tea ready to be plucked is in the March 20's. In the images above and below, you can see an image taken on March 26th in Lincang. Some of the tea in this area was ready to be plucked, but only a small amount (the image above). Other trees were just past budding and still need several days before being picked. (the image below) Keep in mind, most Puer tea is not plucked as two leaves and bud. The farmers are waiting for an adequate amount of stem length and a third, fourth, and fifth leaf (huangpian). A mere bud is not enough.\n\nIt should also be noted that this is just one example, on one mountain in Lincang. As of the writing of this article (March 31st, China time), the old arbor Yiwu teas that are used in Last Thoughts are still not ready to be picked. Last year, they were ready in early April. It's not a set time, but rather observing the trees and the weather until the farmer determines that the tea is ready, just as one would do with apples, tomatoes, or lettuce.\n\nHow does Altitude Affect the Tea Harvest?\n\nAltitude also affects the harvest time, as temperatures are cooler in higher altitudes. As nearly all of the tea that is considered to be highly desirable Puer tea in Yunnan is grown on tall mountains, that means cooler weather and later harvesting. Some of the teas in Yunnan that are grown in low altitude areas producing tea used for green teas, black teas, white teas, and lower quality Puer teas will almost always be ready at least a month before the older growth teas that are in the mountains at altitudes above 1000m (or in some cases even nearing 2000m). This means a wide array of timing for spring teas, but old arbor teas are never ready for spring picking in January and February. Only small bush teas are ready for spring picking so early in the year and are still dependent on the weather.\n\nAre there Earlier Harvests than Spring?\n\nFarmers have increasingly felt pressure to pick tea year round in Yunnan. Much of this is directed by greed of vendors or short term financial needs of farmers, rather than what is best for the tea plants or the long term integrity of Puer. If you closely followed Yunnan weather last winter, you would have seen some images like the one below of ice covered tea trees and snow in Yunnan. Even in Guangzhou, we had snow that was noted as the first snow on record in 60 years. Nothing quite like seeing"}

The unscripted series was seen by millions of Canadians and has aired in dozens of other countries.\n\nThe border agency saw the show as a means of informing Canadians and international audiences about its activities.\n\nOpponents who considered the program crass and exploitative had long pushed for its demise.\n\nThe show amounted to a \"reckless public-relations stunt,\" said Laura Track, counsel for the civil liberties association.\n\nThe association hopes the privacy ruling sounds the death-knell for similar reality TV shows featuring law-enforcement agencies, she said in an interview. \"Filming people in such vulnerable situations is dehumanizing, and showing it as for-profit entertainment is despicable. And what the privacy commissioner decided this week is that it's also illegal.\"\n\nThe border agency told the commissioner the TV program was strictly based on voluntary participation, adding the show would not identify anyone who had not directly agreed to participate.\n\nDuring the agency raid of March 13, 2013, Mata Duran hid inside a building on the construction site but he was found and questioned by an officer about his identity, immigration status and employment. The Mexican man was later brought to an immigration detention facility, where he says he was presented with a consent form that he did not read but signed out of confusion and fear.\n\nUpon viewing the raw footage taken by the film crew, the privacy commissioner's office concluded the entire interaction between the border officer and Mata Duran was captured on video before he was advised of the purpose of the filming, let alone asked for his permission.\n\nUltimately, the commissioner was not satisfied that the border agency obtained Mata Duran's \"valid consent\" for the filming.\n\nIn general, the office concluded that due to the \"coercive nature\" of being detained by the border agency, those held \"may not have a clear frame of mind to provide truly voluntary consent.\"\n\nMata Duran's case raises the overarching question of whether \"there is a public interest to be served by a government institution televising its operational activities,\" the commissioner's report adds.\n\nAfter the raid, Mata Duran was deported to Mexico, where he remains.\n\nTrack lauded him as \"a real hero\" for lodging the privacy complaint when there was no prospect of personal gain, other than an acknowledgment \"that what happened to him was wrong.\""}

Pasteboards, ducats, rain checks.\n\nAnd these tickets were, more often than not, chock full of copious and wonderful details, customized letterforms, and all sorts of archaic references that are seemingly frozen in time. How about background patterns? Like banknotes, these were included in order to fend off potential counterfeiters in the days before photocopiers, much less scanners.\n\nOversized, beautifully designed World Series tickets still exist today.

On October 30, 2013, I was at Fenway Park in Boston, where I saw the Red Sox win the World Series at home for the first time in 95 years. Exiting the ballpark into a raucous sea of celebration, I spotted a piece of paper on the ground. It was an electronically-generated ticket to the game, a souvenir of a historic moment, trampled under foot, sadly discarded. Or not so sadly discarded, because it was an ugly mess, at best. QR code. Bar code. Six or seven dense paragraphs of five point type, informing the bearer that the paper in question is a revocable license, and that the user accepts the risk of injury. See where I am going here? Function sweeps form in four games, Series over.\n\nThe earliest World Series tickets were no better than the sad piece of barcoded paper that I have just described, utilitarian in nature, devoid of visual specificity or charm.

{"id": 1353, "ended": true, "length": 1013, "text": "Hello students. Crunch here with your look behind the GM screen for Wrought Iron episode 16. This is going to be a shorter article as the content of this episode is fairly straightforward and roleplay-focused.\n\nI must admit, I am really surprised that we haven't heard more reactions to what happened in episode 15. That was a big moment and a surprise to everyone at the table, myself included. Does anyone have any thoughts to share? Raise your hands, please.\n\nEpisode 16 was another heavy one. We all came to the table with the burden of emotions from Tilly's death. As a GM, I knew that we had to properly deal with this, but also keep the story moving forward. I think this episode successfully accomplished that. I owe it all to the amazing role playing of everyone at the table. But I have to give a specific shout out to Scott. His performance was absolute aces and exactly what the game needed.\n\nThe funeral, of course, was the focus of the episode. And that transitioned into the party's decision to leave the island. This was my goal all along. When I pitched this campaign, one of the few plans I had was to create a living, vibrant game world with solid connections to the PCs (and players). My reason for doing this was to get to the story to a point where consequences not only happened, but mattered. I think we have accomplished that.\n\nI was very impressed with the funeral rituals that the players came up with during the game. As is typical for our games, we discussed some details before recording, but the majority of what happened was made up on the spot. Creating story elements like this is a skill that is developed with experience. It also requires a level of trust with the other people at the game table.\n\nDeign's confrontation of Kymere was a big moment too. Scott let that happen in the course of the role play, so I was not prepared for the details of the conversation. However, I realized as it was happening that it was a perfect moment for some exposition I was able to include some details that I've been wanting to make known but I think I did it in such a way that this wasn't simply an info dump. In my opinion, this set up the next chapter of the game quite nicely.\n\nSpeaking of details, there is one huge detail that hasn't been addressed by the players. I kind of want to see if they'll ever ask about it, so I don't want to say anything. It's a detail that I came up with in the heat of the moment and realized was a fun way to tie some larger story elements together. From a writer's or show producer's perspective, I want it to come up. I've thought about prompting it to happen. But as a game master, I want things to happen organically. I want that surprise moment. I really hope it happens. I tried to sneak a clue into the dream sequence. Have any of you picked up on it yet?\n\nFor the most part, I didn't prepare anything for this game session. I knew we'd have to deal with the funeral and I knew that the story was getting to the \"let's leave island\" point. I just left it up to the players to deal with their emotions and let scenes happen as necessary.\n\nI always look for advice to share in these articles. Since there weren't any mechanical events to deal with, I can't talk about that. I think what's most important to share here is about creating an atmosphere to let roleplay happen. Players need freedom to let their creativity flow, but they also need a basic structure to work within. The paralysis of indecision is a very real obstacle. But it's easily overcome. However, the structure of the game should not interfere with player choice and agency. I basically gave the players absolute freedom in this game to resolve the events of the attack and funeral as they wanted. I felt confident in doing that because of our experience with each other. I know how these guys play games and how they play off each other.\n\nThat clearly can't happen in a con game or when you're meeting new players. But the same principles apply. As a GM, it's your responsibility to give players guidance, but let them do what they want, within a reasonable context. This is why player buy-in and a session zero is so important. And remember that a session zero can be just a brief conversion with players before a game starts to discuss the focus of the game, its themes, and its content.\n\nThis episode could be considered the end of a chapter of Wrought Iron's story.

Richards and Justice face five counts of animal crush charges and two obscenity charges.\n\nA spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office of Southern Texas confirmed the Houston case is the first in the nation brought under the revised law.\n\nIn April 2010, the Supreme Court decided 8-1 in U.S. v. Stevens to strike down Section 48 of Title 18 of U.S. Code as unconstitutional. The code, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion of the court, penalized \"anyone who knowingly 'creates, sells, or possesses a depiction of animal cruelty,' if done 'for commercial gain' in interstate or foreign commerce.\"\n\nThat case involved a man who sold videos of dogfighting and of dogs attacking other animals. He challenged his indictment on the grounds that Section 48 violated the First Amendment. Though the government argued the code was necessary for cases of \"animal crush\" and animal fighting videos, the court held \"a law may be invalidated as overbroad if 'a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional.'\" The court, therefore, did not discuss whether animal crush videos were a special case that could warrant an exception to the First Amendment.\n\n\"We \u2026 need not and do not decide whether a statute limited to crush videos or other depictions of extreme animal cruelty would be constitutional,\" Roberts wrote for the court.\n\nThe court invalidated the law altogether as overbroad, prompting Congress in September of that year to pass the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010, which specifically prohibited animal crush videos and defined them as \"any photograph, motion picture, film, video or digital recording, or electronic image that: (1) depicts actual conduct in which one or more living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, or amphibians is intentionally crushed, burned, drowned, suffocated, impaled, or otherwise subjected to serious bodily injury; and (2) is obscene.\"\n\nThe \"and obscene\" provision would be key if the statute were challenged anew, said First Amendment expert and University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey Stone.\n\n\"[Congress] passed this very complicated law that does not add anything to the scope of what is criminal,\" Stone told POLITICO. \"So as long as we stipulate that the material has to be obscene to be prosecuted under the statute, then why don't you just prosecute you under the obscenity statute?\"\n\nThe reference to obscenity also appears to limit the statute's application in several ways, including limiting it to videos that are sexual in nature.\n\nStone believes that if the case were to be brought to the highest court, the question at issue would be whether there is a legitimate reason to distinguish this type of obscenity from others.\n\nWith free speech restrictions, the government cannot constitutionally pick and choose what type of speech to restrict based solely on its content, as established in the hate speech case R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul. Stone compares the animal crush statute to a law creating higher penalties for purveyors of homosexual obscenity as opposed to non-homosexual obscenity \u2013 the government in both cases would need to show why the distinction serves a societal necessity.\n\nStone said in defense of the law, as in the comparable issue of child pornography, sometimes the government punishes selling depictions of something cruel to take away the incentive for individuals to commit the cruelty in order to profit off of it.\n\nThe animal crush statute carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison; the obscenity statute carries up to five."}

It could swallow the Earth whole and still have room for Mars.\n\nKey points Juno Key points: NASA'S Juno spacecraft will fly over Jupiter's Great Red Spot at 12:06pm (AEST)\n\nThe weather system is a 200-year-old hurricane that is 16,000km across\n\nJuno will provide the first ever close-up snaps of the solar system's biggest storm\n\nAnd at 12:06pm (AEST) on Tuesday, NASA's Juno spacecraft hurtled right over the top of it.\n\nThe gargantuan hurricane has been raging for 200 years or more \u2014 and we've never been as close to it as the spacecraft came today.\n\nTravelling at about 50 kilometres per second, Juno flew within 9,000km of the billowing brick-red cloud tops.\n\nPrior to the encounter, the Juno mission's principal investigator, Scott Bolton from the Southwest Research Institute in Texas, said of the mission: \"It's going to be incredible.\"\n\n\"We're basically just scraping along the top part of the atmosphere.\"\n\nThe storm itself is a good 16,000km across; Juno, if you include its outstretched solar panels, is the size of a tennis court.\n\n\"We're going screaming past, but we've got cameras that know how to work at that speed,\" Dr Bolton said.\n\n\"I can't wait to see what it looks like.\"\n\nShare Winds within the Great Red Spot, seen here dwarfing the moon Europa, peak at more than 600km per hour.\n\nThe team will have captured the first-ever close-up snaps of the solar system's biggest storm, but it will be hours yet until the team receives confirmation the mission was successful.\n\n\"Nobody knows exactly what kind of features we'll see inside, what the kind of colours and swirling of the clouds are,\" Dr Bolton said beforehand.\n\n\"Maybe we'll see something that looks three-dimensional, like a tunnel going in \u2014 nothing would surprise me at this point.\"\n\nAs it watched the Great Red Spot skid past, Juno also drifted upwards away from Jupiter because its closest approach \u2014 a mere 3,500km above the cloud tops \u2014 happened about 11 minutes earlier. If Jupiter were the size of a basketball, this venture brought it within millimetres of the surface.\n\n'Through the gates of hell'\n\nIt's the sixth time the NASA probe has buzzed the giant planet since putting itself into a precise, lopsided orbit almost exactly a year ago.\n\n\"There's high risk in every flyby. We're going through the gates of hell, every time,\" Dr Bolton said.\n\n\"And each time we go by, we're going through a worse region. More hazard, more radiation.\"\n\nJupiter's magnetic field, 20,000 times stronger than Earth's, endows the gas giant with vast and punishing radiation belts Juno must thread a path between. So the probe's inner workings are shielded by a thick titanium wall, which has successfully withstood the onslaught so far.\n\nBased on early calculations, Dr Bolton said, the team was confident Juno would succeed again \u2014 but the team did not take anything for granted.\n\n\"We will be on the edge of our seats, just keeping our fingers crossed that everything works and we get the close-up pictures that we all want,\" he said.\n\nIn order to have all its instruments staring down at Jupiter, during the flyby Juno faced the wrong way to communicate with Earth. It was expected to be a few hours before the team received confirmation the craft was intact and still functioning.\n\nThen begins the process of downloading actual data: first from Juno's magnetometer, then from its camera. And the photos will be sent in chronological order, starting with the ones taken at greater distances.\n\nThe first close-up views of the Great Red Spot will not arrive until at least the weekend, according to Dr Bolton.\n\n\"You really have to learn patience when you're in this business. And it's patience during a time when you're very tense. I've learned that.\"\n\nSeeking the secrets of a storm\n\nWhen they do arrive, Juno's measurements will open a new chapter in our understanding of this famous anticyclone (so named because it spins in the opposite direction to most storms).\n\nThe Great Red Spot has been studied continuously since the early 1800s, and even some of the earliest views of Jupiter through telescopes, in the late 1600s, reported a big spot on its surface. Many astronomers think this was probably the very same storm.\n\nWhat keeps a planet-sized hurricane spinning for 450 years?\n\n\"That's a big puzzle; nobody knows,\" Dr Bolton said.\n\n\"There are some scientists who believe that in order for a storm to have lasted"}

After six months, it is available under a Creative Commons License (Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International), as described at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n\n\u03b2-thalassemia, one of the most common genetic diseases worldwide, is caused by mutations in the human hemoglobin beta (HBB) gene. Creation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from \u03b2-thalassemia patients could offer an approach to cure this disease. Correction of the disease-causing mutations in iPSCs could restore normal function and provide a rich source of cells for transplantation. In this study, we used the latest gene-editing tool, CRISPR/Cas9 technology, combined with the piggyBac transposon to efficiently correct the HBB mutations in patient-derived iPSCs without leaving any residual footprint. No off-target effects were detected in the corrected iPSCs, and the cells retain full pluripotency and exhibit normal karyotypes. When differentiated into erythroblasts using a monolayer culture, gene-corrected iPSCs restored expression of HBB compared to the parental iPSCs line. Our study provides an effective approach to correct HBB mutations without leaving any genetic footprint in patient-derived iPSCs, thereby demonstrating a critical step toward the future application of stem cell-based gene therapy to monogenic diseases.\n\nThe RNA-directed Cas9 nucleases from the type II bacterial CRISPR/Cas system have been shown to be robust and versatile tools for generating DSBs in eukaryotic cells ( Cong et al. 2013 ; Mali et al. 2013 ). The guide RNA (gRNA) contains a 20-nucleotide (nt) guide sequence followed by a trinucleotide (5\u2032-NGG-3\u2032) protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) that can direct Cas9 via Watson-Crick base-pairing to target a desired locus ( Deveau et al. 2010 ; Deltcheva et al. 2011 ; Gasiunas et al. 2012 ; Jinek et al. 2012 ). To explore the potential application of the Cas9 system for gene correction in \u03b2-thalassemia, we combined this strategy together with the piggyBac system to correct the mutations in iPSCs prepared from a patient doubly heterozygous for two \u03b2-thalassemia mutations, and we achieved efficient seamless correction of both mutations in the iPSCs ( ). Additionally, we set up a new protocol for hematopoietic differentiation from iPSCs using monolayer-based culture, which enabled detection of increased HBB expression in corrected iPSCs compared to the uncorrected parental lines.\n\nThe ideal approach to curing a genetic disease such as \u03b2-thalassemia is to correct the mutations that cause the disease. Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the patients' own somatic cells could provide a rich source of cells for correction of the \u03b2-thalassemia mutation. The mutation-corrected iPSCs could be differentiated into HSPC for autologous transplantation. Such an approach would avoid the problems of immune responses to allogeneic transplantation and the possibility of insertional mutations associated with viral gene delivery.\n\n\u03b2-thalassemia is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the human hemoglobin beta (HBB) gene. It is a common inherited disease extending from the Mediterranean area through the Middle East to Southeast Asia. Patients homozygous with \u03b2-thalassemia mutations have severe anemia and usually require frequent transfusions and iron chelation. So far, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only cure available when histocompatible donors are available. To date, one HBE1-\u03b2-thalassemia patient treated with lentiviral delivery of a normal HBB gene into his hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) has required no further blood transfusions ( Cavazzana-Calvo et al. 2010 ). However, gene therapy using viral vectors that integrate randomly into multiple sites of the host genome may potentially cause harm, as has been found in other genetic diseases ( Hacein-Bey-Abina et al. 2003 ; Woods et al. 2006 ).\n\nIn order to evaluate whether the gene correction in patient-derived iPSCs could restore the expression of HBB, we differentiated these cell lines into the hematopoietic progenitors and erythroblasts using monolayer culture ( ). Both corrected and parental lines changed morphology rapidly upon differentiation ( ) and produced CD34 + CD43"}

In three prior visits to Pocono, he has earned a win and podium finish in Indy Lights presented by Cooper Tires followed by an 11th-place finish in his only previous Verizon IndyCar Series race on the \"Tricky Triangle\" oval.\n\n\"Extremely excited (for Pocono),\" said Chaves, who will drive the No. 88 Harding Racing Chevrolet this weekend. \"It's been awhile since Texas. I feel like we gained some good momentum from Indianapolis and Texas. Moving on forward, hopefully we can just keep that up and get another great finish.\"\n\nAt the 101st Running of the Indianapolis 500 presented by PennGrade Motor Oil in May, Chaves returned to an Indy car seat for the first time nine months and finished ninth in Harding Racing's debut. It was his best showing in three attempts at \"The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\"\n\nThose numbers were exceeded just two weeks later in the Rainguard Water Sealers 600 at Texas Motor Speedway. The series' 2015 Sunoco Rookie of the Year battled through the crash-filled affair to finish fifth \u2013 his first top-five finish in 25 career starts.\n\nHis resume at Pocono has also been impressive. In two Indy Lights starts, Chaves has one win and two podiums. His only start there in the Verizon IndyCar Series came with Bryan Herta Autosport in 2015, when he charged through the field from 16th starting spot to lead 31 laps before a mechanical issue relegated him to the 11th-place finish.\n\nChaves believes he and Harding Racing can keep the momentum going this weekend.\n\n\"I think the expectation is still the same, which is \u2026 we feel like we've got a pretty car in both races that we've done so far,\" said Chaves. \"Absolutely, racing is a little bit about luck and we had some good luck at both races, but we also had a competitive car where we were racing guys, challenging for positions and making passes on track.\n\n\"I expect that to be the same at Pocono and, of course, I expect us to make progress as far as our overall competitiveness in the race weekend. We should be, and I hope that we can be, a lot closer in our qualifying speed and challenge even better during the race.\"\n\nLarry Curry, team manager and race strategist, has put together a team full of individuals with experience in Indy car racing. Combined with Chaves' resume at Pocono, there's reason to believe in another strong performance.\n\n\"We know how well Gabby has run at Pocono in the past,\" said Curry. \"So even though we didn't get to go there and test, we are going to run in the simulator at Dallara on Aug. 15 and 16 before we come to Pocono to just get Gabby re-familiarized with the track and all that bit. Hopefully that'll help us settle in quicker there.\n\n\"The expectations are that we certainly believe we can go there and have another top-10 run.\"\n\nThe ABC Supply 500 is set to be the last race of the year for Harding Racing. Plans are in the works for a full Verizon IndyCar Series season campaign in 2018, Chaves is hoping they saved their best for last this year.\n\n\"The game plan is certainly to come out right away in a stronger stance than we did at Texas,\" said Chaves.\n\n\"At Texas, we had very limited information on the new track surface, so we had to play the game of getting a good race car. At Pocono, we've got a little bit more information (in advance). I've been there before, so we can be a little bit more aggressive in how we enter the weekend and how we unload our car in practice and how we go on about qualifying.\n\n\"Then when we go racing, it's obviously going to be a bit of a stretch to say we can go out there and win, but that's always the goal. We're never aiming for second, third, fourth, fifth or even 10th place. You always want to aim for the win, but we understand the reality and we understand it's very unlikely, but that is always the goal.\n\n\"So we'll go out there and we'll do everything we can to have the fastest car. I'll do everything I can to make sure I'm driving to the best of my potential and ability and see where that gets us.\"\n\nABC Supply 500 practice begins at 9 a.m. ET Saturday (live stream on RaceControl.IndyCar.com), with"}
{"id": 1371, "ended": true, "length": 765, "text": "Mega Man 3 nes\n\nThe Mega Man series sees itself move into the third installment of the franchise and the game play had remained the same. You are introduced to sliding, which would become a regular trademark in the Mega Man Classic series and also Rush. In addition to that, there is a new robot named Protoman, whom is Mega Man's brother. Speaking of Protoman, am I the only one who thinks he reminds me of Racerx from the cartoon Speed Racer? Anyhow, let us talk about the game itself and talk about the plot. Plot: Dr. Wily has said that he has \"turned\" over a new leaf and is working with Dr. Light to build Gamma. However, there are problems in this world caused by evil robots and it is up to Mega Man to stop them. Unknown to Mega Man, it was actually Dr. Wily that sent them out and continue his never-ending quest to try to take over the world. What made this different was that it had a little bit more of a plot in this one instead of just stopping Wily from taking over the world. There are also some battles with Proto Man more of a training battle but instead of him being pure evil. There is even a many battle with him under the name Break Man. Game Play: It is identical to the previous games and it's a Mega Man game. You are challenged and it just doesn't end with the robot masters and then go to Wily directly. This one introduces a mini boss battle; doc bots that have the powers from the Mega Man 2 robots and then you go to Wily Castle. There really isn't much to say about graphics and that everything is simple and you know what everything is. They are perfect for the NES time. You see, it wasn't complex but it was perfect and couldn't have been done better in my honest opinion. Before the Dr. Wily stages, you go to four Robot Master stages and try to beat them with different patterns. This would be the last Mega Man game in the NES series that you weren't allowed to go back to the stage to see if you can do better each and everytime. The challenge is there and each stage can vary based upon difficulty. It does take time on memorizing and does have the return of the Devil creature or as I call it the annoying blob monster that just wouldn't go away. There is also a boss that is difficult but not as bad as the first one with the Mega Man clone. There are three of them and only one is real but can be beaten fast. The final boss is Gamma and does have somewhat of a look that can resemble Guts Man but can beaten with one major blow. That Top Spin attack, while pretty much a useless weapon can actually knock out Gamma in one blow if timed right and the battle is over. There is some brief mention and you see Proto Man but more will be told. From the Mega Man Animated Series, I don't remember Top Man in an episode at all so he must have been the odd robot on this one. Those two never appeared in an episode but in Season 3 of Captain N, Top Man appears but mostly didn't look like the robot masters from the game or even somewhat resemble them but that's another story. There is something else to point out and that's Proto Man is quite a contrast to the games itself. On the show he is a villain and regularly help out Dr. Wily but won't let anyone but himself destroy Mega Man whilst in the game he doesn't go out of his way to destroy Mega Man but merely face him in competition. There's really nothing else I could say. The game kept you going and to be perfectly honest would be fitting to get a Virtual Console release.Read full review"}

{"id": 1373, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "A more sensitive climate system How much global average temperature eventually will rise depends on the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS), which relates atmospheric CO 2 concentration to atmospheric temperature. For decades, ECS has been estimated to be between 2.0\u00b0 and 4.6\u00b0C, with much of that uncertainty owing to the difficulty of establishing the effects of clouds on Earth's energy budget. Tan et al. used satellite observations to constrain the radiative impact of mixed phase clouds. They conclude that ECS could be between 5.0\u00b0 and 5.3\u00b0C\u2014higher than suggested by most global climate models. Science, this issue p. 224\n\nAbstract Global climate model (GCM) estimates of the equilibrium global mean surface temperature response to a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 , measured by the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), range from 2.0\u00b0 to 4.6\u00b0C. Clouds are among the leading causes of this uncertainty. Here we show that the ECS can be up to 1.3\u00b0C higher in simulations where mixed-phase clouds consisting of ice crystals and supercooled liquid droplets are constrained by global satellite observations. The higher ECS estimates are directly linked to a weakened cloud-phase feedback arising from a decreased cloud glaciation rate in a warmer climate. We point out the need for realistic representations of the supercooled liquid fraction in mixed-phase clouds in GCMs, given the sensitivity of the ECS to the cloud-phase feedback.\n\nMixed-phase clouds, ubiquitous in Earth's atmosphere (1) at temperatures between 0\u00b0 and \u201340\u00b0C, strongly influence Earth's radiation budget (2\u20134). For a fixed amount of cloud water, spherical liquid droplets tend to be smaller in size (5) and also to outnumber ice crystals, because ice nuclei (IN) are relatively scarce in Earth's atmosphere in comparison to cloud condensation nuclei (6). As a consequence, clouds that consist of a higher fraction of liquid are optically thicker and hence more reflective of sunlight. Here we refer to the fraction of supercooled liquid within a mixed-phase cloud at a particular isotherm as the supercooled liquid fraction (SLF).\n\nIt has recently been shown that SLFs are severely underestimated on a global scale in a multitude of global climate models (GCMs) (7, 8). This arises from two main causes. The first cause concerns the challenge of representing the microscopic nature of the various mixed-phase cloud processes (9) that cannot be resolved at the typical spatial scales of GCMs. The Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen (WBF) process for ice crystal growth is one such process that critically affects SLFs (8, 10\u201312). This process refers to the growth of ice crystals at the expense of surrounding supercooled liquid droplets in a mixed-phase cloud as a consequence of the lower saturation vapor pressure over ice relative to liquid. An ambient vapor pressure in between the saturation vapor pressures over liquid and ice is both a necessary and sufficient condition for the WBF process to occur in mixed-phase clouds (5). GCMs typically parameterize the WBF process by assuming homogeneous mixtures of supercooled liquid droplets and ice crystals within a model gridbox (10, 11). However, in situ observations suggest that such mixtures rarely exist in nature. Instead, pockets composed purely of either supercooled liquid droplets or ice crystals that are orders of magnitude smaller than the volume of a typical GCM gridbox are suggested to be the norm (13, 14). This implies that the WBF process may be too efficient in GCMs and is thus potentially a culprit for the underestimation of SLFs in GCMs. The multiple modes of ice nucleation (5), further complicated by the uncertainty associated with the efficiency of the various IN species (15), are additional factors contributing to the uncertainties in SLFs.\n\nThe second cause concerns the fact that mixed-phase clouds are poorly constrained because of the difficulty of obtaining observations of these clouds (16, 17). Although mixed-phase clouds are ubiquitous in Earth's mid- and high latitudes (1), in situ observations of these clouds are naturally limited by sparse spatial and temporal coverage. Technical difficulties in distinguishing liquid and ice particles of varying sizes, as well as artefacts associated with ice crystal shattering on probes (18), further complicate this matter. Satellite observations by NASA's Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument (19) offer an attractive alternative by providing global measurements of cloud thermodynamic phases since 2006.\n\nTo address the aforementioned issues, we constrained cloud phase in version 5.1 of the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5.1) (20) by using 79 months of observations obtained by CALIOP. CAM5.1 is a state-of-the-art GCM, used for climate studies worldwide, and is among the GCMs that severely"}

Burnett's then recent prot\u00e9g\u00e9s had just released their self-titled debut album which featured him at the production helm. The Sisters opened the event and I saw what he perhaps saw while watching their performance as did the jaded industry folks who stopped hobnobbing and stood entranced by the delicate harmony and winning personalities on stage. I was a fan.\n\nThe duo recently released a 7 inch released by Jack White's Third Man Records and had their song \"Tomorrow Will Be Kinder\", inspired by the Alabama tornado outbreak, featured on the T Bone produced soundtrack for The Hunger Games.\n\nThe duo were kind enough to give thoughtful l answers to emailed questions submitted by me and some of my twitter followers.\n\nTwang Nation: What was your first experience with music?\n\nThe Secret Sisters: The two of us have been completely surrounded by music since we were babies. We spent many summers attending bluegrass festivals with our dad, who is a bluegrass musician. Though we can't remember that far back, it's very likely that the first concert we ever attended was a bluegrass festival somewhere in the South. We really believe that bluegrass musicians are some of the most incredible, skilled artists in the music world, and growing up in those circles helped us appreciate a time-honored musical genre and tradition that still finds its way into our music on a regular basis. We are very influenced by certain aspects of the bluegrass world, and that sound has been ingrained in us since we were very young.\n\nTN: Alabama musicians seem to look after one another \u2013 from the Drive-By Truckers , John Paul White from the Civil Wars and Doc Daily \u2013 what is the source of that camaraderie and how has it helped you?\n\nTSS: We believe that the camaraderie comes from the desire to see Alabama be well represented again. Alabama is known for producing some of the most legendary artists, musicians, and songwriters in all of music history. It seems to us that all Alabama musicians are proud of the heritage we have, and we just really cheer for one another when big things happen, when our fellow Alabama artists get recognized for their talent. We've had countless compliments and expressions of support from other artists in Alabama, and knowing that those people are supporting us helps us keep going. It's almost as though we've all subconsciously joined a movement to put Alabama back in the musical spotlight. That movement also requires a bit of a responsibility-we don't want to do anything to tarnish the reputation of great music in our state, and we believe that all the artists in Alabama help to hold each other accountable for always putting out quality music.\n\nTN:What is your songwriting process like? Do you walk into the studio with ideas fully formed or do you work it out in the studio?\n\nTSS: All of our songs come about in unique ways. Sometimes they come to us quickly, other times we struggle with them for hours and hours. We've spent a lot of time this year working together on our songs, and also exploring songwriting with some of our very favorite cowriters. It has been a wonderful learning experience and we still have so much to figure out. For the second record, we've chosen to have our songs mostly complete when we go into the studio. It saves time, and having a real grasp of the song ahead of time gives everything a good direction to work from. Of course some changes will be made once we get into the studio, but for the most part our songs are all ironed out and ready to be put to tape.\n\nTN:Your self-titled debut album album was executive produced by one of the godfather's of Americana, T-Bone Burnett. How was working with him and how did it open doors for you. Did his association hamper you in any way?\n\nTSS: Working with T bone has been very advantageous for us. He has been very kind and protective towards us, and we truly believe that much of our progress can be attributed to his involvement in our career. His knowledge of music history and sound quality is absolutely incredible, and he has taught us so much, in a very short amount of time. Having him in our corner helped us be involved in the Hunger Games soundtrack, which was a huge boost to our career. He's constantly fighting for us and involving us in the cool projects that he undertakes, and it's very nice to know that someone so well-respected is looking out for us.\n\nTN:What compels young performers to create or cover music that is, or sounds like it's, from generations before they were born?\n\nTSS: For the two of us, we choose to cover songs only if we love them."}

Radiation therapy for prostate cancer has undergone tremendous evolution in the past two decades and has included techniques such as: Four-field external beam treatment; 3D conformal radiation; Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT); Brachytherapy (low dose rate radioactive seed implantation, and high dose rate brachytherapy); Tomotherapy; Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT); Proton therapy; and, most recently: CyberKnife\u00ae stereotactic radiosurgery.\n\nCyberKnife \u00ae is a robotic radio-surgery system, which is used to treat a variety of benign and malignant tumors. It is composed of a compact linear accelerator (a source of radiation), which is mounted on a computer-controlled arm. The CyberKnife \u00ae System uses real-time continuous image guidance during each treatment session. It delivers multiple beams of high-energy radiation to the tumor from many different directions, and constantly adjusts for any movement of the target organ. The net result is a high dose of radiation delivered to the cancer, in the most precise way currently possible. Radiation treatments are accurately delivered to the prostate and a small amount of tissue surrounding the prostate, minimizing the amount of radiation received by sensitive nearby structures (such as the bladder, rectum, and penis).\n\n\nA typical patient would proceed as follows: Prostate cancer is suspected due to an abnormal prostate exam or an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level; Prostate cancer is diagnosed by a prostate biopsy; X-rays (a bone scan, MRI or CT scan) may be ordered to evaluate the extent of the cancer; Treatment options are discussed. If CyberKnife \u00ae is selected, the patient is referred to Philadelphia CyberKnife \u00ae Center in Havertown, PA (610-446-6850, www.phillycyberknife.com) for evaluation by a CyberKnife \u00ae -trained radiation oncologist. When the decision to proceed with CyberKnife \u00ae treatment has been made, the patient returns to Dr. Garber for placement of 4 tiny gold markers (fiducials) into the prostate. This is done in the office with local anesthesia, and only takes a few moments. These 4 gold markers are important; they are used to track the position and movement of the prostate during CyberKnife \u00ae treatments, and allow pinpoint accuracy of the CyberKnife \u00ae therapy. Approximately 1 week after placement of the gold markers, the patient is scheduled for a CT and/or MRI scan of the prostate. Once this data is available, Dr. Garber and the radiation oncologist carry out computer-based treatment planning, so that the CyberKnife \u00ae targets the prostate and avoids the surrounding tissues. Once the treatment planning is complete, the actual treatments are scheduled. All treatments are outpatient. They are painless, and take 1-2 hours each. Typically only 5 treatments are needed, and are done over the course of a week. No anesthesia is required. To see video animation of the CyberKnife\u00ae system, click here. Typical advantages of CyberKnife \u00ae stereotactic radiosurgery include the following: Treatments are painless and non-invasive No anesthesia is needed Only 5 treatments needed, unlike the 6-7 weeks of daily treatment needed for standard radiotherapy Quick return to normal activities Radiation is directed precisely at the prostate, with maximal sparing of the bladder, rectum, urethra and penis, thus minimizing radiation cystitis and proctitis No scalpel, no surgery, no blood loss, no risk of infection Proton therapy, widely touted in the news media, cannot compensate for prostate movement and cannot be targeted as precisely as CyberKnife \u00ae . Dr. Garber has pioneered CyberKnife \u00ae treatment of organ-confined prostate cancer in the Philadelphia area, and is featured on the Philadelphia CyberKnife \u00ae website (www.phillycyberknife.com).

Disembodied artificial vaginas and various other orifices are just not his cup of tea, which to be honest, I can understand. However, over my years of reviewing and blogging about toys, I have amassed quite an intimidating collection, yet he didn't have a single one to his name, which just didn't seem fair.\n\nAt times we discussed what sort of products he might be interested in giving a go but most things just didn't appeal, either because of looks, materials used or just his general lack of interest in generic masturbators.\n\nOne thing he did decided he'd like to play with more is vibrations on his penis. On my suggestion he experimented with my We-Vibe Touch and Doxy and had a pretty great time, so I researched male vibrators and the only ones to really grab my attention were those by Hot Octopuss. The Pulse III seemed to tick all my partner's boxes - no fake vaginas or anuses, it's made of silicone, waterproof, and rechargeable. I planned to buy it for Christmas anyway but we were lucky enough to be sent one as a tester which was brilliant!\n\nThe packaging is basic but very sleek and tasteful - something that was quite important to my partner as any weird gurning pornstars on the box would have been an instant turn-off. We did have a little giggle at the random bearded model on the lid, though! Inside the box you get the Pulse III, a magnetic USB charging cable, an instruction manual and a nice little branded storage bag. It is recommended to charge the toy fully before use, which apparently can take up to 3 hours, however, ours was done sooner than that.\n\nWe were both very impressed with the looks and build quality of the toy. The silicone of the \"usable\" area is silky smooth (as you'd hope!) and the wings are very flexible to ensure comfort. My partner's penis is on the girthy side (6 inches circumference) and fitting him in was no hassle at all so I do not hesitate in saying that the Pulse III will fit any guy. The \"base\" (bit of the toy that rests in your palm during use) is shiny ABS plastic.\n\nThe instruction manual says you can use the toy with or without lube and that you can use it from flaccid, which is not something we've actually managed to try, haha! You can either hold the toy still and let the vibrations do their thing or use it like a stroker.\n\nAfter some experimenting, my partner found he had the best results using the Pulse III with an ample amount of lube for comfort and he prefers the \"stroker\" method over holding it still. He was very impressed with the rumbly quality and range of the vibrations and found that the vibrating plate is positioned perfectly while the silicone wings wrap around his shaft and spread the vibrations (nearly) all the way round. However, despite movement, he says he doesn't really notice the texture from the ridged section towards the bottom at all.\n\nTwo niggles he had were that the buttons are rather stiff and therefore difficult to operate, especially while the toy is actually in use. This can cause a little bit of \"stopping and starting\" and it can be awkward to actually turn it on and off which can be annoying when lacking patience! Secondly, it is quite noisy - not wand level noisy but it's not subtle. This isn't an issue for us but might be for someone sharing a house.\n\nOverall, my partner is really chuffed with his first proper sex toy. He loves the sensations it produces and while it takes him a little longer to orgasm with it than by other means (which is not a fault, he's just still getting used to a new thing!) it's definitely worth it!"}

{"id": 1379, "ended": true, "length": 799, "text": "A group of students from Boston University has set out to build a commodity derivative exchange for digital currencies, allowing those who hold large amounts of bitcoin to hedge against market volatility.\n\nAlt-Options, co-founded in June 2014 by Joe Zhou, Kevin Foo and Marco Cuesta, aims to act as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for bitcoin, allowing digital currency derivatives to be publicly bought and sold instantly on its platform. The new platform launches in this month with a competition in collaboration with the College Cryptocurrency Network .\n\nFor the uninitiated, financial derivatives are simply contracts agreed upon between two parties: whoever holds the asset, in this case, bitcoin, and whoever wants to speculate on the future price of the asset. One of the most popular types of derivatives, a call, is defined as the right to purchase an asset at a preset price, called a strike price, before some date in the future. Should the market price increase above the strike price, the option owner purchases and immediately sells the asset, pocketing the difference.\n\nIn exchange for signing the contract, the option purchaser pays whoever owns the asset a small fee. Asset owners enter into these types of contracts for the guaranteed income, and the option purchasers are incentivized with the large upsides associated with this type of trading. Other popular financial derivatives include puts, where the option owner reserves the right to purchase an asset at a specific price up until a period of time, and futures, where the owner must purchase the asset at a specific price on a specific day in the future.\n\nUsers can purchase financial derivatives offered by Alt-Options in order to both speculate on large bitcoin price movements and decrease volatility. For instance, if a user believed the price of bitcoin was going to increase above $300 sometime in the next six months, he or she could purchase a call at $300 for a small fee. If the price were to reach $350 before six months passed, the user would exercise his option, the bitcoin would be sold on the open market, and the user would pocket $50. If the user's prediction proved incorrect, the asset owner who sold him the option would simply keep the small fee.\n\nHowever, if a user wanted to protect herself from a price drop below $250 in the next six months, she would purchase a put at $250 on her personal balance of bitcoin on the Alt-Options platform, again paying a small fee. Should the price fall below $250, she would exercise her right to sell her bitcoin for the strike price of $250, protecting her from volatility in the bitcoin market. And while this arrangement may not seem revolutionary, calls and puts play an important role in the world market today by allowing large players to hedge against large swings in the market.\n\nFinancial derivative exchanges have been lucrative for years. Founded in 1898, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange took in $3 billion in 2010. At the end of March 2008, the notional amount of all outstanding positions stood at $81 trillion, according to the Bank for International Settlements.\n\nWhile Alt-Options is currently regulated by Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regulations, it has been able to bypass stricter guidelines by using \"strong partnerships with regulated (bitcoin) exchanges,\" said Alt-Options co-founder Joe Zhou in a recent interview. \"There are no specific guidelines regarding digital assets, but we foresee some sort of regulation or set of guidelines from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the future.\"\n\nAlt-Options aims to find the same volume that allowed Chicago Mercantile Exchange to prosper with bitcoin trading. With tools typically found on pro-trading platforms and American-style options for retail clients, a team of students is hoping to revolutionize the way mining firms liquidate assets, hedge risk and manage the incredible amounts of bitcoin they generate every day while allowing casual and professional traders to experiment with bitcoin."}

That makes things more convenient for those whose machines are still vulnerable. It makes things more difficult for those who installed the previous series of patches on banks of end-user machines, who must now fix the same flaw yet again, while making sure the new patches don't create conflicts with the old that might make Windows itself unstable.\n\nOne minor surprise in that fix: It's not just machines running Microsoft Office that are at risk; those running Silverlight or .NET are vulnerable as well.\n\nThe less-obvious but far more interesting news was that Microsoft patched a hole making Windows vulnerable to a whole class of exploit Microsoft supposedly shut the door on years ago.\n\nDuring the mid- to late-'90s, one of the most successful ways to infect a Windows machine was to write a virus disguised as a Word macro, or one buried as a self-launching stealth macro in .DOC files for Microsoft Word.\n\nThe problem was so common and filters so unreliable that many companies shifted from Word's standard .DOC format to Rich Text Format (RTF), which displayed most of the text formatting from Word documents but wouldn't run macro files.\n\nNow Microsoft is warning that a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that would launch a malware payload when users launch RTF documents widely supposed to be safe.\n\nThe flaw, reported by one of Microsoft's network of bug catchers, would give attackers who poisoned an RTF file in the right way the same access rights as the user who launched them, giving hackers a back door or remote control over even the PCs of users who believed they were being careful by not opening image or executable files from strangers.\n\nRead more of Kevin Fogarty's CoreIT blog and follow the latest IT news at ITworld.

In February, Diamond filed a lawsuit against GDC officials, and on Friday the Department of Justice dealt the GDC a major blow, claiming that the state's failure to adequately treat inmates with gender dysphoria \"constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.\"\n\nThe DOJ weighed in on Diamond's case via a statement of interest, which offers recommendations for how the district court in Georgia should rule in the case. It focused on Georgia's so-called freeze-frame policy, which prevents inmates from receiving hormone therapy for gender dysphoria if they were not identified as transgender and referred for treatment immediately during the prison intake process. \"Freeze-frame policies and other policies that apply blanket prohibitions to such treatment are facially unconstitutional because they fail to provide individualized assessment and treatment of a serious medical need,\" DOJ officials wrote, adding that similar policies have been previously struck down in Wisconsin and New York.\n\nChinyere Ezie, Diamond's lead attorney, says the defense has until next Friday to submit briefs in response to the complaint, which may include a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The first hearing for the case is scheduled for April 13. You can read the DOJ's entire statement below, and check out our earlier coverage of Diamond's case."}

The tale, by now, is a familiar one: aside from cricket, there is a rueful lack of infrastructure and facilities for most other sports in India. The few icons that have broken through such as tennis stars Leander Paes and Sania Mirza \u2013 both of whom have had a very successful 2015 \u2013 are celebrated not just for their achievements, but for also for scaling heights in spite of a system in which all the odds were stacked against them.But let us look at the brighter side. Despite the obstacles, India continues to throw up some incredible talent across the sporting spectrum. Perhaps, it is time to start recognising and celebrating their achievements as well.\n\n\nJoshna Chinappa beat the reigning world number one on Saturday.\n\nSource: Facebook\n\nDipika Pallikal has (justifiably) been grabbing eyeballs with her exploits on the squash circuit, but her Chennai compatriot Joshna Chinappa is not too far behind. Ranked 17th in the world currently (just three places behind Pallikal), Chinappa became the first Indian player to win a British Junior Open title in 2005. In 2014, she teamed up with Pallikal at the Commonwealth Games to win India a gold, the country's first ever medal in squash.On October 31, Chinappa pulled off the unthinkable. In one of the biggest upsets in squash, she defeated world number one, Egypt's Raneem El Welily, in the first round of the Qatar Classic Squash Championship. Not surprisingly, she described it as \"the best win of my career\".\n\n\nSaurav Ghosal is the highest-ranked Indian in world squash.\n\nSource: Pornchai Kittiwongsakul/AFP\n\nIt would be fair to say that Saurav Ghosal has not got the adulation he deserves. Ranked 17th in the world currently, this 29-year old from Kolkata has been single-handedly carrying the mantle for men's squash in the country for the past few years. At 40 places below Ghosal, Mahesh Mangaonkar is the next highest-ranked Indian. Ghosal's list of achievements make for proud reading \u2013 the first Indian to be ranked junior world number one, a team gold medal at the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon and a silver in the singles. His next target is to break into the top 10 in the world.\n\n\nSrikanth is currently ranked fifth in the world.\n\nSource: Xinhua\n\nThe lanky 22-year old from Andhra Pradesh is helping carry forward the legacy of Indian badminton greats Pullela Gopichand and Prakash Padukone. From a world ranking of 240 in 2012, Kidambi has swiftly climbed up the ranks and is now ranked fifth in the world. He has shown that he can be quite the giant-killer.Kidambi made history in 2014 by beating then-number one Lin Dan to win the China Open, making it the first time an Indian male shutter had won a Super Series Premier event. With the 2016 Rio Olympics coming up, there will be great expectations for Kidambi to deliver a medal.\n\n\nDipa Karmakar won a bronze medal at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.\n\nSource: Indranil Mukherjee/AFP\n\nFor a young girl who had flat feet at the age of six, Dipa Karmakar has come a long way. After becoming the first Indian woman to win a Commonwealth Games medal in 2014, Karmakar became the first Indian to qualify for the finals of the World Gymnastics Championship, where she finished fifth on October 31. Aged 22, this Tripura girl is already considered to be among the finest gymnasts that India has ever produced. And if her performance at the World Championships was any indication, she is just getting started.\n\n\nBhambri broke into the world's top 100 this year.\n\nSource: IANS\n\nWhile Sania Mirza and Leander Paes win plaudits for their exploits on the doubles circuit, 23-year-old Yuki Bhambri is probably India's biggest hope when it comes to the singles. On November 1, Bhambri beat Evgeny Donskoy in Pune to win the ATP Challenger, his second major triumph in 2015 after he won the Shanghai Challenger in September. His consistent performances allowed him to break into the top 100 in world tennis this year, the first Indian since 2010 to achieve the feat."}

He had a chance to score from the penalty spot too, but Brad Guzan saved his penalty.\n\nHe couldn't score in his brief spell with Malaga either, but he was credited with two assists from his 11 La Liga matches.

Family members and rights activists have expressed outrage at the decision, which was taken in secret.\n\nWednesday's appeal court hearing in Kabul was held behind closed doors.\n\nJudge Ali Masir Murid told the BBC that three of the condemned men had been sentenced to 20 years in jail; a fourth received 10 years because he is a minor.\n\nOne of these four men was the amulet seller Zainuddin, who had the original argument with Ms Malikzada, 27, the BBC's David Loyn in Kabul reports. The caretaker of the shrine, Omran, was acquitted, he adds.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The brutal killing shocked the world and has been seen as a potential watershed in Afghanistan\n\nAnalysis: David Loyn, BBC News, Kabul\n\nThe way the appeal was heard, in a closed court, with no journalists or other observers present, is only one of the troubling aspects of this decision. Exact details of the ruling have not yet been formally announced, but this does appear to be the final appeal hearing.\n\nProminent women's rights activist Wazhma Frogh said that if the keeper of the shrine does now walk free, then she is \"completely outraged\".\n\n\"Farkhunda was killed because she was a woman,\" she said. And the judges have treated her case lightly. In Afghanistan, \"not only the Taliban, but the whole system is oppressing women\", she added.\n\nThe widespread anger both here and around the world about the murder led to unusual transparency, with cameras allowed into the first court appearances. But that openness has not been continued through the appeals procedure.\n\nMs Malikzada's brother Najibullah told BBC Persian: \"It's not a court, it's just a show... The media should have been there, we should been there, the lawyers should have been there.\n\n\"It's a real theatre. The whole world laughs at the judicial system of Afghanistan. Do the judges have families, sisters, mothers - or not? Do they have a heart? We will not accept this decision.\"\n\nHe accused the authorities of \"a tyranny\" against the family, who have been living in fear since the attack.\n\nAt the original trial in May, eight men were given jail terms of 16 years, as well as the four who received death sentences.\n\nLater in the month, 11 policemen were sentenced to one year in prison for failing to protect Ms Malikzada, a devout Islamic student. Eight other police officers were acquitted.\n\nThe treatment of the police was condemned as too lenient, in a country where women are frequently denied justice.\n\nKimberley Motley, an American lawyer in Afghanistan who represented the family during the previous trial, also criticised the ruling.\n\n\"I'm extremely surprised and disappointed. I'm very concerned because this happened in a very closed hearing, it wasn't transparent as the first court was and so there's questions as to why this even occurred.\n\n\"There's very strong evidence through video and through eyewitness testimony that justified the original sentences that were imposed on these men.\""}

Butterfly is an exclusive club for 'lonely' women, concealed within the confines of a high-end Beverly Hills men's shop. Successful doctor Linda, high-powered attorney Jessica, and swimming pool contractor Trudie, are all members. Each is looking for that elusive something that will make their lives complete. Each of these women are successful in their professions, at a time when these are male dominated areas. But who is the driving force behind Butterfly, and why? That is the real story here, and it is one of betrayal, determination and ultimately, of revenge. It is the story of Rachel Dwyer, and how far she will go to right the wrongs done to her.This book is a fascinating look at the lengths one smart and determined woman will go to, in order to cause the utter humiliation of the one person who ruined her life. The various threads of what Butterfly is, what the three women, Jessica, Trudie and Linda have in common and who is behind it all are woven together with intricate care and detail, and encompassing more than three decades in the life of the main character orchestrating it all. Above all, this is the story of Rachel Dwyer and Danny McKay, and how things can go so terribly wrong sometimes.This book begins in the late seventies, at Butterfly, with the women who want to fulfill their fantasies and feel something. Linda is looking for that elusive thing, an orgasm, after two husbands have called her frigid; she needs to explore herself and discover why. Trudie lives for her visits to Butterfly, not understanding why her Saturday night pick-ups don't measure up to what she has at the club. And Jessica, powerful and successful as an attorney to the rich, powerful and famous, just wants someone to see her for the strong woman she is, not the inept and inconsiderate person her husband considers her. Each of these women discovers the cause of her particular difficulty and is finally able to move on, thanks to the men of Butterfly.In this book, we meet Rachel when she is an impressionable fourteen year old, and she is already aware that she is quite unattractive, almost ugly in fact. When her father comes home drunk, he decides to try and have sex with her, but her mother knocks him out with a skillet and tells Rachel she needs to get away while she can, and thus begins Rachel's journey through life. She meets and falls for Danny, but he sees her as just a means to an end. He takes her to a west Texas brothel, and sets her up with the madam, where even someone who looks like Rachel will be able to earn her keep. Two years later, Rachel is still there but Danny is moving on to bigger and better things, and finally tells her just what he really thinks of her, tossing her out on the side of the road, bleeding, after a botched abortion. This is where it really starts getting good.Rachel is highly intelligent, and extremely motivated. She reinvents herself, and becomes Beverly Highland, one of the most powerful women in Hollywood by the time she is thirty. I loved watching as Rachel/Beverly recreated herself, all for the purpose of bringing Danny McKay down. Everything she does is with one single goal; find a way to raise Danny McKay up as high as she can, just so she can destroy his life. I like Rachel's strength of character, something she held onto no matter what life threw in her path. I also liked that she never forgot her friends, and was able to help them turn their lives around.Danny McKay is a scheming and egotistic man, always looking for ways to trick or cheat his way to the top. He becomes one of the most popular and well loved evangelists, with millions of followers, based in part on the miracle he performed early in his career: bringing a man back to life during one of his huge revivals. He is sneaky, and will dispose of anyone who stops serving his purpose. It is this very trait that will bring Danny down, because every person he carelessly discards is then helped by Rachel and all of them become pawns in her war to destroy Danny.This may sound like there are no happy ever afters in this one, but you would be wrong. The way Ms. Harvey has woven the threads here to bring happy endings for Jessica, Trudie and Linda, and even a happy ending for Rachel/Beverly. It is a story that spans the period from the Great Depression of the thirties through to the seventies, and I found it fascinating that the turning point in so many lives here was the death of President John F. Kennedy, tragic though that was. If you are looking for a fascinating and intriguing trip trough the past, and the motivations behind what people will do to each other, I highly recommend Butterfly."}

{"id": 1395, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Illustration: Shaye Anderson\n\nThe first thing people tell you about Judge Rodney Gilstrap is that he's not from Marshall. In the small Texas city (population 24,000) east of Dallas where he presides as a US district court judge, where you're from matters, and the 59-year-old Gilstrap was actually born in Pensacola, Florida. But because he earned both his BA and his law degree at Baylor University (three hours away in Waco, Texas), has practiced law in Marshall since the 80s, and married a local girl whose family owns the town funeral home, most folks forgive Gilstrap this blight.\n\nThey also probably cut him some slack because of how he's run his court for the last five years.\n\nSince taking the bench in 2011\u2014moving literally across the street from his law office into the district courthouse\u2014Gilstrap has become one of the most influential patent litigation judges in the country. In 2015, there were 5,819 new patent cases filed in the US; 1,686 of those ended up in front of Judge Gilstrap. That's more than a quarter of all cases in the country; twice as many as the next most active patent judge.\n\nThese include some of the most contentious and headline-grabbing patent disputes in the US. There's the 2013 case where a jury awarded a patent troll $2.3 million, a decision Gilstrap later overturned. There was also the $533 million patent troll win in a case against Apple, a decision Gilstrap has now stayed to allow for appeal.\n\nThis busy patent docket didn't blossom overnight, and it's not some strange coincidence. Due to some unique rules around intellectual property filings, patent holders can often file their lawsuits at any district court in the country, even if neither the plaintiff nor the defendant is based there. By introducing a list of standing court orders and local regulations, the Eastern District of Texas (and, in particular, Gilstrap's division of Marshall) has become the court of choice for many plaintiffs, especially non-practicing entities, or NPEs.\n\n\"There's not a jail here. Less than 10 percent of the cases in Marshall are criminal cases, which is very unusual for a district court.\"\n\nNPEs, better known as patent trolls, don't produce anything. Rather, they buy up patents for the sole purpose of suing other companies for infringement. In the 80s and 90s, as computer technology rapidly developed, the US Patent and Trademark Office became inundated with requests for software patents, which it overwhelmingly approved, even though many of these were broad and vague.\n\nBy the 2000s, NPEs were regularly scooping up old, fuzzy patents for things like \"methods and systems for gathering information from units of a commodity across a network,\" and launching multiple lawsuits against every digital company under the sun that could maybe, sort of fall under the category of their vague patent.\n\nThese lawsuits waste time, cost billions, and hurt innovation. It's estimated that patent troll suits alone cost American companies $29 billion a year (that's based on a figure from 2011, so it's likely higher than that now). The whole point of the patent system is to protect ideas and encourage innovation, not to provide an industry where shell companies that do nothing are able to extort millions from companies that actually create things, provide jobs, and add (some kind of) value to society.\n\nBut that's exactly what patent trolls do. And they overwhelmingly choose to do it in the Eastern District of Texas.\n\nThe district courthouse in Marshall, Texas. Image: WikiMedia Commons\n\nSome of the proverbial scaffolding propping up this troll-luring system was inherited by Judge Gilstrap, while some of it was his design, and he's been happily maintaining this unintentional specialized court for half a decade. It's a boon to the town, where visiting litigators bring in money and perks, from lawyers ordering catered lunches at the local restaurant, to Samsung sponsoring an outdoor skating rink downtown.\n\nBut as the number of patent cases continues to grow, scrutiny over the way the system is currently set up grows along with it. Politicians, law experts, and advocacy groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have been highly critical of the fact that patent holders get to choose their court and often, by extension, their judge. There are multiple legislative proposals to reform the way patent cases are filed in the US and, if passed, they would effectively end Marshall's heyday as a hotspot for IP trials.\n\nIn the meantime, the Eastern District of Texas remains the most active patent court system in the country, and Gilstrap is its poster boy.\n\n***\n\nThe Eastern District of Texas wasn't always a magnet for patent cases. Spanning 44 counties along the northeast corner of the state, the district was historically a pretty sleepy jurisdiction. But throughout the 90s and early 2000s, a series of events"}

{"id": 1397, "ended": true, "length": 859, "text": "The HTC U11 is better than the Google Pixel for many reasons and after more than a month it is clear to me the U11 is one of the best Android phones you can purchase today.\n\nI started using the HTC U11 in early June so the new car smell has worn off and it's time to validate my full review rating. While you can save a couple hundred for a mid-tier device, the U11 is worth the $650 ($599 with an HTC discount code). That's a couple hundred less than flagships from Samsung and Apple, but that savings does not mean it compromises in any regard.\n\nAs I look back over the last month of use and towards the future, here are several reasons to consider the HTC U11:\n\nPerformance: HTC's Sense UI has been one of the fastest and most responsive compared to what we have seen from others. The HTC U11 is extremely responsive all of the time. I never really noticed much lag with my Galaxy S8 Plus, until I started using an HTC U11. If you want a phone that lets you jump around between apps and get things done efficiently, then the U11 is one to consider. Camera: HTC must have learned some things in developing the camera for the Google Pixel as the HTC U11 offers the best camera HTC has ever provided in a smartphone. The U11 is quick to focus and captures true-to-life colors with its rear camera. I have been pleased with nearly every shot I've taken and the U11 performs as well as the rest of the best. Audio experiences: The lack of a headphone jack bothered me at first, but with the included USB Type-C USonic noise-cancelling earbuds I quickly forgot about the 3.5mm port. Audio through headphones is incredible and the best I have heard on a mobile phone with volume also so loud I can never go above about 80 percent. The dual BoomSound speakers are also excellent with alarms shattering the quiet in the morning. Design: IMHO, there is no better looking phone than the HTC U11. Unlike Apple, HTC smartly has all black fronts on all of its phones. However, the back and sides is where you get blown away. The brilliant colored backs are gorgeous and I love grabbing my Sapphire Blue model every day. A Solar Red one just arrived for some testing and it too is stunning. If you like your phone to grab someone's attention, the U11 will do that. Water resistance: While I don't plan to swim with my phone, the fact that the U11 has a high level of dust and water resistance gives me peace of mind. It also allows me to use it while running, cycling, or hiking without having to pop my SIM in a phone with water resistance. Software updates: The HTC U11 launched with Android 7.1.1 out of the box so it is running a later version of Android than the Galaxy S8. HTC has a good track record of updates so we should soon see the monthly Android security update. In addition, we expect to see the Amazon Alexa integration that was promoted during the launch of the U11. Edge Sense: At first I thought the squeeze factor was just going to be another gimmick I would never use. It turns out it is a useful feature to have and I use it every day to launch the camera and squeeze and hold to launch the Google Now cards interface. You can disable the feature if you like, but try it out for a couple of weeks and you may find it as useful as I do.\n\nAfter testing the Sprint HTC U11 for a couple of days, I ordered my own GSM unlocked Sapphire blue model and have enjoyed using it since it arrived. The only cons I have really seen over the past month are the fine scratches that are now present along the bottom back curve where the phone rests on a table. HTC includes a clear plastic back cover case in the box, but the device is too gorgeous for me to carry in a case so I'll let some wear appear instead.\n\nI look forward to seeing what the Alexa integration adds to the device experience as well as further learning of my daily habits by the HTC Companion.\n\nRelated stories:"}

It extends into Malawi's neighbors Tanzania and Mozambique.\n\nThe lake provides water for drinking and domestic use to millions of Malawians. Part of the lake is protected as a national park, and it is inhabited by more than 850 cichlid fish species found nowhere else on Earth.\n\nPaladin Africa is the Malawi subsidiary of Australian mining giant Paladin Energy Ltd, with 15 percent owned by the Government of Malawi.\n\nLast year, Paladin Africa's Kayelekera Mine in Karonga produced 1,066 metric tonnes of U3O8, triuranium octoxide, a compound of uranium. One of the more popular forms of yellowcake, U3O8 is converted to uranium hexafluoride to make enriched uranium for use in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons.\n\nA statement issued by the Natural Resources Justice Network (NRJN), a coalition of 33 civil society organizations active in the extractive industry sector \u2013 mining, oil and gas, expressed grave concerns about a recommendation by the National Water Development and Management Technical Committee in the Ministry of Agriculture that the minister issue a discharge permit to Paladin Africa.\n\nOfficials from Paladin Africa at a November 4 meeting told participants, according to NRJN members present, \"Paladin fears that if the water from the tailings dam is not released into Rukuru River then there is a high risk that the contaminated water from the dam would overflow as a result of the impending rains.\"\n\nThe NRJN network, including local community members, Traditional authorities, faith leaders and concerned citizens in and around Karonga, issued a statement November 19 giving the company until November 26 to issue an official statement confirming that it will not discharge mining waste sludge into the rivers.\n\n\"Paladin should inform the whole nation the actual reason why they would want to release water from the tailings dam. The tailings dam does not collect surface running water and as such there is no way the tailings dam would overflow because of just rainwater,\" NRJN said.\n\nPaladin claims the mining wastewater to be discharged would be managed to meet the World Health Organization drinking water guideline for uranium, which is 30 micrograms per liter.\n\nPaladin officials said that there would be no risk to people drawing water for domestic purposes from the river system downstream from Kayelekera Uranium Mine, nor any threat to the environment.\n\nBut the NRJN coalition is not persuaded by the company's assertions.\n\nThe NRJN statement cites \"confirmed reports\" that the Kayelekera Tailings Storage Facility is holding a very high grade of uranium ore, which had to be dumped because of complications in extracting the uranium.\n\nAll of the uranium present in the ore cannot be extracted due to technical limitations, the coalition maintains, so the waste sludge still contains five to 10 percent of the uranium initially present in the ore, which poses a radioactive threat to humans, animals, fish and plants.\n\nThe coalition says Paladin's fears that the mine's tailings pond could overflow, indicates major flaws in its design and construction.\n\nThe NRJN says it is \"shocking and inhumane\" for Paladin to put the lives of millions of Malawians at risk as a result of the company's failure to plan properly.\n\n\"We therefore ask Paladin to build a second tailings dam as was the initial plan and consequently refrain from this malicious practice of discharging radioactive effluents into the river systems, which would subject lives of innocent Malawians to a series of acute and chronic health effects,\" the NRJN said in its statement.\n\nHealth hazards to humans exposed to high levels of radiation include lung cancer, skin cancer and cancer of the throat, among other illnesses.\n\nThe coalition is calling for an independent team of chemists to conduct studies of the lake to ascertain whether effluents proposed for discharge from the mine are indeed safe.\n\n\"The dismal past track record of governmental monitoring and regulation of mining operations does not inspire confidence,\" NRJN said. \"We therefore insist that no permit to dump waste effluent be granted to Paladin (or anyone else) until such time as we are assured that"}

It was Tom Clancy's second piece of published work with the U.S. Naval Institute.\n\n\nA considerable amount of public debate has been held in the past five years on the question of the MX missile system. This weapon would be the most powerful in the U. S. inventory, capable of sending ten thermonuclear warheads to ten separate targets with a high degree of accuracy. It seems fair to observe at the outset that MX is a system with a counterforce capability designed into the package.\n\nThe question of the missile's mission capabilities, however, has been largely ignored in this country. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and other foreign observers have noted that MX is potentially part of a war-fighting, war-winning strategy \u2013 something which American officials deny while ascribing this same objective to the Soviets (as might be expected, the Soviet position is a precise mirror-image of our own).\n\nIn any case, the debate in this country has centered on the basing system for the missile. It is currently accepted in the defense establishment that many of our Minuteman missiles probably can be destroyed in their silos before the National Command Authority (NCA) can respond to a nuclear attack. Although the preconditions required for a successful first strike are awesome, the problem is one of engineering rather than theory.\n\nDiscussions on the MX revolve around how to deploy the missiles in such a way as to assure their survival under the most adverse circumstances. Thus far, the official solution \u2013 multiple-protective\u2013shelter (MPS) basing mode-has been rejected. Unfortunately, MPS is not perceived as survivable against a determined attack by Soviet missiles. The Reagan Administration's recently proposed method of deployment is to have \"dense packs\" of missiles. This plan also appears to be drawing heavy political fire.\n\nA successful MX deployment system must meet a number of tests:\n\nInsensitivity to first strike: The deployment scheme must allow a large proportion of its missiles to survive a strike and retaliate in force. The MX is more likely to deter a war rather than fight one if this criterion is met.\n\nThe deployment scheme must allow a large proportion of its missiles to survive a strike and retaliate in force. The MX is more likely to deter a war rather than fight one if this criterion is met. Reconstitution of forces: The insensitivity to attack must continue for an indefinite period of time.

It marked the first time since 1910 that a group other than the country's two mainstream parties -- the conservative Tories and center-left Labour -- came out ahead in a national election.\n\nUKIP party boss Nigel Farage spoke of the \"most extraordinary moment in British history for a hundred years.\" Even in the capital city of London, where UKIP fared poorly during municipal elections on Thursday, the party managed to attract a respectable 17 percent of votes.\n\nWith its criticism of the European Union mixed with a polemical stance against immigrants and the political establishment, the right-wing populists appear to have struck a chord with many Brits.\n\nThe euroskeptics' election victory had been anticipated for weeks. Still, it triggered an uproar within the House of Commons' three largest parties: A strong fourth party on the political stage has the potential to dramatically shift the country's political calculus. In European Parliament, UKIP will now have more seats than Prime Minister David Cameron's Tories (who scored just under 24 percent of the vote) and Labour (which secured 25 percent).\n\nCameron's government coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats -- the only British party to campaign on a pro-Europe message -- lost 10 of their 11 EU parliament seats. Already, calls are growing louder for Liberal-Democrat party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to step down. Even the Greens managed to surpass the Liberal-Democrats.\n\nTories Demand Non-Aggression Pact with UKIP\n\nCameron himself is likewise under pressure following Sunday's vote. Nervous representatives of the party's right wing are calling for Britain's referendum on EU membership to be held earlier than previously planned. They want to close a non-aggression pact with UKIP in advance of the next election for the House of Commons in May 2015. They fear that if the Tories and UKIP campaign against each other it will divide the Conservatives and result in a broad defeat.\n\nSunday's outcome could also prove a curse for Britain's European partners as well. Growing domestic political pressure will force Cameron to take a firmer line in Brussels than he has thus far. Furthermore, he is certain to become less willing to compromise -- a development that will likely make itself felt in the coming days when EU leaders begin negotiations over the next European Commission president.\n\nFarage Watched Cricket on Election Day\n\nNone of the party heads spoke to the press on Sunday night and the only leader in a celebratory mood was Farage, who attended a UKIP party in Southhampton after spending his Sunday afternoon watching a cricket match in Turnbridge Wells. \"It was a very English scene. I thoroughly enjoyed myself,\" he told the Guardian.\n\nIts success in the European election has transformed UKIP into a national party. UKIP even scored a seat in the European Parliament in Scotland, marking the first time the euroskeptic party has ever won a mandate north of England. A blog post in the Financial Times noted that Farage had \"justified the media hype of recent weeks.\"\n\nStill, many experts believe UKIP has now reached its zenith and that the only way it can go from here is down. The party could be stifled as soon as June, at least if the Tories win a by-election in the constituency of Newark. But the highest hurdle facing the party is the entry into the House of Commons. UKIP has never managed to win seats in the national parliament because Britain's first-past-the-post system places smaller parties at a disadvantage.\n\nIn 2015, Farage wants to field two dozen candidates, the largest number ever for the party. To combat allegations that his party only has two issues -- the EU and immigration -- Farage will likely make increasing forays into other policy areas. On Monday, Farage announced he plans to name point persons within the party for areas such as defense and health.\n\nThey are steps that make it clear that UKIP is on its way to becoming part of the political establishment."}
